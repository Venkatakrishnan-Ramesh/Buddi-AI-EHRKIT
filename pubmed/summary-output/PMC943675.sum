These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that SUMO-dependent process interfere with amastigote growth and argue that amastigotes strongly restrain macrophage SUMOylation to enhance their intracellular niche and increase parasite growth.Figure 3Host SUMOylation modulates L. amazonensis infectionTHP-1 cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing non-silencing (NS) shRNA or against SUMO1 (S1) or SUMO2 (S2) and differentiated to macrophages using PMA.

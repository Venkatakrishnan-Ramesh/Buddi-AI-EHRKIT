Scale bars = 500 μM, cells are gated for viable CD11c+ DCs and further assessed for their CD80, CD86, MHC-II, and MHC-I surface expression.b.Carefully remove 6 mL of media directly from surface.c.With the remaining media detach loosely attached cells by pipetting over the dish several times.CRITICAL: Post differentiation, do not use highly adherent cells as most of these cells do not represent mature BM-DCs (Helft et al., 2015).d.Transfer cell suspension in a 15 mL falcon and count cells.9.Antigen loading of BM-DCs.a.Spin down cell suspension at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.b.Resuspend 2 × 106 cells in 2 mL culture medium per well and plate in a 6 well plate.c.Immediately add 10 μg/mL MOG35–55 (freshly thawed aliquot).Note: Always plate a little more BM-DCs than needed.

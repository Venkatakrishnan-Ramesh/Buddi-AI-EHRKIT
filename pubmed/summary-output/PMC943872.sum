It is also consistent with previous work on readmission risk factors after nonobstetric, nonpsychiatric hospitalizations in the pre-COVID-19 era.16,21,25 However, we found that, although in-hospital death was more likely and lengths of hospital stays were longer with SARS-CoV-2 than historical norms for other respiratory tract infections,28–30 postdischarge event rates were similar after admissions for COVID-19 as with other medical causes of hospital admission before the pandemic in both provinces.23,25,29–32 This mirrors data from England where the median length of stay for COVID-19 was 7 days (compared with 8 d in our study) and the risk of 6-month readmission or death was similar for hospital admission for COVID-19 in 2020 as it was for admissions for influenza in 2017–2019 (34.8% v. 37.8%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91–0.98).12 Although outcome rates were similar in Alberta and Ontario, the discrimination performance of the LACE score for post-discharge readmission or death23 was suboptimal in our study population; including sex, discharge locale and socioeconomic status in the model improved prediction performance (akin to previous studies of the LACE+ model).25

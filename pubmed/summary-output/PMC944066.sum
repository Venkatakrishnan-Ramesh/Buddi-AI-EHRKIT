Dihydropyridines have a greater affinity for peripheral vascular smooth muscle cells, while nondihydropyridines have a greater affinity for cardiomyocytes.5 CCBs exert their pharmacological effect by inhibiting the alpha-1 subunit of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels leading to the prevention of calcium influx intracellularly required for myocardial, vascular, and GI smooth muscle contraction.5 This, in turn, results in the relaxation of vascular smooth muscles leading to vasodilation and hypotension, myocardial depression resulting from excessive negative inotropy, bradycardia resulting from negative chronotropy, and atrioventricular node blockade due to negative dromotropy.5 In addition, CCBs also inhibit L‐type calcium channels in pancreas Islet cells, leading to a reduction in insulin secretion, hyperglycemia, and reduced cardiac glucose utilization.6,7 The drop in blood pressure due to CCB toxicity is a result of a combination of factors such as negative myocardial inotropy and chronotropy as well as peripheral vasodilation.6–9

The acromioclavicular (AC) joint is a diarthrodial joint serving as the articulation between the scapula and clavicle and is responsible for both scapulohumeral and clavicular motion, allowing the shoulder to perform dynamic movements.1,2 AC-joint dislocations are a common injury, affecting 2 of every 10,000 people in the general population and comprise 9% to 12% of all injuries to the shoulder.1,3,4 Most injuries occur through contact activity, which drives the acromion inferiorly with the clavicle remaining in its anatomic position, initiating a cascade of injury propagating from the AC ligament followed by failure of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments.5,6 Many techniques have been described for AC joint injuries, without a consensus gold standard.7 The revision setting offers even less consensus on treatment options and countless difficulties for surgeons.

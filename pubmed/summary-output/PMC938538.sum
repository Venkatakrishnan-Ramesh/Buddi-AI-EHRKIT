At 24 months, 95% of eyes achieved IOP ≤18 mm Hg, 100% had IOP reductions ≥20% from baseline, 86% were on fewer medications than at baseline, and 69% were medication-free.47 The investigators explained their rationale for the combined procedure by pointing out that TM dysfunction can occur in eyes with ACG and thus opening the angle alone may not fully address outflow obstruction; coupling excisional goniotomy to the cataract extraction and goniosynechialysis procedures removes potentially dysfunctional TM and optimizes aqueous outflow through the TM outflow pathway.47

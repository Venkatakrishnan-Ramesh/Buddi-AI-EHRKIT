Given the potential infant exposure to antidepressants via excretion into breast milk, this study evaluated the concentrations of allopregnanolone in breast milk and maternal plasma from the start of a 60-h infusion of brexanolone injection through 7 days in 12 healthy volunteers.A population pharmacokinetic model was constructed to successfully describe the variability and concentration versus time profile of allopregnanolone in plasma of brexanolone-treated patients with postpartum depression (PPD) and healthy volunteers, and the distribution into breast milk of healthy volunteers (total, 156 women).

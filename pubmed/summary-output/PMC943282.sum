Endothelial pump function relies on both lactate transport and an intact osmotic barrier.20,21 Changes in cell shape in Slc4a11 KO corneal endothelium have been reported.9 In Slc4a11 KO corneal endothelial cells, aberrations in actin cytoskeleton assembly, tight junction organization, cell shape changes, and increased paracellular permeability were observed.9 In young animals, AAV9-HA-Slc4a11 introduction restored all of these changes to the levels comparable to those observed in WT animals.

The study objectives were to assess the prevalence of the eosinophilic phenotype (a blood eosinophil count > 300 cells/mm3) among severe asthma patients, identify an overlap between the eosinophilic phenotype and the allergic phenotype, and compare the eosinophilic phenotype with the noneosinophilic phenotype in terms of clinical features and patient-reported outcomes.

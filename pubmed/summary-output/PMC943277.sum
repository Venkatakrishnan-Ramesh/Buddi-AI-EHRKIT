For prophylaxis of coronary vasospasm induced by 5-FU infusion in these high-risk patients, we propose starting nitroglycerin (10 Î¼g/min) prior to chemotherapy infusion while inpatient followed by oral isosorbide mononitrate (and nitroglycerin patches if necessary), with sublingual nitroglycerin available for breakthrough, to vasodilate the coronary vessels during chemotherapy treatment.

We found that views towards COVID-19 vaccination were generally similar across ethnic groups between June and October 2020, while larger UK quantitative studies conducted within the first year after vaccine rollout demonstrated lower uptake in certain ethnic minority groups, and there were sometimes further inequalities by age, gender, religion, area deprivation, disability status, English language proficiency, socioeconomic position and educational attainment.21â€“24 Surveillance data demonstrate that COVID-19 vaccination rates in the UK and Israel were lowest among certain ethnic minority groups.25 26 For UK healthcare workers between December 2020 and February 2021, studies found that some ethnic minority groups were more likely to be COVID-19 vaccine hesitant in comparison with white British groups,12 and that COVID-19 vaccine uptake was lower among some ethnic minority groups compared with white people.27 In a US youth survey, black participants were less likely and Asian participants more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine compared with white participants.28 Being from an ethnic minority group alone may not account for vaccine uptake differences; attitudes and intentions vary depending on multiple factors including location, time, socioeconomic status and cultural context.

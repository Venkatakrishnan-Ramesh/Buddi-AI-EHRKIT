Standard anterior/posterior drawer and Lachman tests are completed to detect complex knee instabilities, which are further differentiated by diagnostic arthroscopy.TableÂ 2Pearls and PitfallsStepsPitfallsPearlsClinical examinationTo mistake an increased external dial test for anteromedial instability in case of posterolateral instability.Observe and palpate the medial tibial plateau during the external dial test and anteromedial drawer.Graft harvestingTo injure the tibial insertion of the gracilis tendon.Use an open tendon stripper and preserve the tibial insertion of the gracilis tendon.The dimension of the gracilis tendon is insufficient.Harvest the semitendinosus tendon instead.Femoral fixationAbnormal graft length change pattern through knee range of motion.Perform an isometry test before femoral graft fixation.Femoral tunnel convergence in case of combined anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.Orientate the medial collateral ligament tunnel proximally and anteriorly.Tibial fixationInsufficient graft length.Fixate the free end of the gracilis tendon proximal to the tibial insertion site of the superficial medial collateral ligament.Minimally invasive approachEntrapment of the saphenous nerve and its infrapatellar branches.Respect the medial layers and shuttle the graft deep to the fascia.

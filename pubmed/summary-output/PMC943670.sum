In 1999, the Institute of Medicine (IOM, now National Academy of Medicine/NAM) published To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System.1 One of the IOM/NAM's central messages was that reporting safety events is the foundation for understanding systemic risk and improving patient safety.2 In keeping with the safety advancements made in other high-risk industries such as aviation, the IOM/NAM report specifically recommended that healthcare organizations improve the reporting of patient safety events by submitting “incident reports” or “safety reports.”3 Analysis of the large amounts of data garnered from safety reports over the years has identified a troubling trend: very few safety reports are submitted by physicians.4 In a study of 92,547 adverse event reports across 26 hospitals, physicians (both attendings and trainees) submitted only 1.4% of these reports.5 Further analysis of those safety reports reveals an even more troubling trend: physician trainees—front-line workers uniquely situated to identify safety events, near-misses, and unsafe work conditions—are even less likely to report safety events than attending physicians.6,7 In one study, safety reports filed by resident physicians constituted <1% of all safety reports hospital-wide.8

The state of oral health and oral health care for older Americans was specifically examined over the last 20 years to identify areas of progress, areas that require more work, and those that hold promise in Section 3: Oral Health Across the Lifespan: Older Adults.45 The following call to action resulted from the review: “A policy that mandates dental coverage in Medicare would reduce health inequities for older adults by assuring access to preventive and other oral health services for all, including those who are place bound or in need of caregiver assistance.” The most recent legislative efforts to realise a dental benefit in Medicare were not successful, but a growing and diverse body of advocates continue to pursue such legislation and one survey found that 93% of older respondents supported the addition of a benefit.

claimed that immunohistochemical analysis of patients with non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors showed that patients with high levels of tumor-infiltrating neutrophils or macrophages or positive NETs or METs expressions, had worse recurrence-free survival [37], suggesting that macrophages may morph into METs near the boundary between tumor and necrotic areas in glioblastoma to promote tumor invasion or necrosis.

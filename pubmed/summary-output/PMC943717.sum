In summary, we conducted a longitudinal study on patients with intermediate and pan uveitis who were imaged with ultra-wide field FA and OCT. Our study suggests that OCT measurements, especially MV in the 6-mm circle, can be an alternative or implemention for quantitative measurement of active vascular leakage in patients with uveitis.

Current guidelines indicate that patients with clinically definite relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) should begin treatment with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) as soon as possible.However, gastrointestinal (GI) side effects of oral DMT treatment for MS are an important consideration for patients and can impact adherence to treatment plans.This qualitative research with healthcare professionals and patients provides a more complete picture of the patient experience of RRMS and GI-related adverse events that illustrates an unmet need for an oral DMT treatment that mitigates the initial obstacle and ongoing impact of persistent GI-related adverse events on patientsâ€™ lives.The GI-related symptoms and impact concepts assessed by the Individual Gastrointestinal Symptom and Impact Scale (IGISIS) and Global Gastrointestinal Symptom and Impact Scale GGISIS patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires are meaningful and relevant to patients.

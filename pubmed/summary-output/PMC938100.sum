We will briefly review the causes of chronic pain in the context of the affected fields innervated by DRG neurons and go over the major categories of known chronic pain mediators, their cellular sources, their receptors on the neuronal membrane and the signal transduction pathways that affect the firing of an action potential by which sensory information is transmitted to the CNS.

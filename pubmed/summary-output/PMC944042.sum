In A. pseudoterreus, when LaeA is overexpressed, 9/13 quantified genes involved in phosphate acquisition are repressed at 36 hours (g < 0.05) and for genes where protein was quantified, such as homologs of the acid phosphatases pho-3 (456,862) and pacA (430,438), this repression is maintained later in the culture at 60 and 84 hours (Table 6), suggesting LaeA overexpression may inhibit activation of these genes in phosphate limited conditions.

(G) Force trace and stage displacement as described in F. If one or more ABS3 molecules on the platform bead bind to the actin filament while the stage is moving, one of the trapped beads is pulled out of its equilibrium position (demarcated by the blue force trace), thus applying load to the ABS3â€“F-actin bond.

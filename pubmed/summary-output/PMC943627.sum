A review of the literature revealed that individuals suffering from infection with S. ventriculi typically present with epigastric abdominal pain or spasms, abdominal distension, nausea, and subsequent emesis.5 Typically, in cases of S. ventriculi infection, endoscopy revealed esophageal and gastric inflammation with diffuse erythema, gastric ulcer, and retained food and bile.5,7 Endoscopic evaluation in this case revealed a unique well-defined margin between normal and abnormal mucosae that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously described but could be a feature that would raise suspicion of this infection at the time of endoscopic evaluation.

Repeat three times.c.Add anhydrous toluene (77 mL) via syringe.d.Stir the reaction mixture rigorously at 25°C for 5 min.e.Heat the reaction mixture to 110°C and keep stirring rigorously for 1 h under N2 atmosphere.CRITICAL: The reaction time should be controlled within 1 h to avoid the formation of oligomers.f.After cooling down to 25°C, remove the toluene by rotary evaporator under vacuum (50 mbar) at 50°C to afford the crude product.g.Purify the crude product by column chromatograph (CC) on silica gel using a mixture of PE and DCM as eluent (PE/DCM= 3/1, v/v).h.Collect the target product and remove the solvent by using rotary evaporation under vacuum (200 mbar) at 40°C.i.Recrystallize the product from methanol and dry under the vacuum to get the target compound as purple-blue solid (yield 31%).j.Analyze the product by NMR and MALDI-TOF MS.DTD: 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ, ppm): 8.90 (m, 4H), 7.62 (s, 2H), 7.26 (m, 6H), 4.03 (s, 8H), 1.94, (s, 2H), 1.30–1.20 (m, 160H), 0.90–0.84 (m, 24H).

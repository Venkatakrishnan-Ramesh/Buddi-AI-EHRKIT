The wounding itself (control vehicle) yielded maximal influxes of neutrophils, which corresponded to the maximal levels obtainable in the air pouch mouse model with intact skin.19 Therefore, the use of COAM for induction of local neutrophil influx and the inherent host-protective effects of neutrophils in skin wounds may be limited to pathological wound healing conditions, eg, in neutropenic patients after chemotherapy or after exposure to therapeutic or accidental radiation.

Currently, commonly used noninvasive fibrosis models include the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI),13 body mass index (BMI)-AST/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio and diabetes score (BARD),14 fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4),15 and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS).16 The formulas for calculating these non-invasive scoring systems are shown in Supplementary Table 1.

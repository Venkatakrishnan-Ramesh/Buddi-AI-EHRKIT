The major findings are as follows: (i) PFA is being employed to treat both paroxysmal and persistent AF patients, most frequently as a first-ever procedure, (ii) the acute success of PVI was good at 99.9%, (iii) there a favourable procedural workflow with >80% of cases performed without endotracheal intubation, and mean procedure time of ∼1 h, (iv) no oesophageal complications, symptomatic PV stenosis, or phrenic nerve injury persisting beyond hospital discharge—confirming the tissue preferentiality of PFA, (v) the occurrence of other non-PFA-related complications including a 1.6% rate of major complications, largely pericardial tamponade and stroke, and a 3.86% rate of minor complications, largely of vascular origin, (vi) a rare complication of coronary vasospasm was observed after PFA at the posterior mitral annulus (rate of 0.06%), and (vii) the overall procedure-related mortality was low at 0.06%.

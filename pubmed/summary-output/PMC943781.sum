In contrast to the well-established role of ECs and macrophages in mesenchymal transition, a higher infiltration of T cells is extremely unexpected due to the improved prognosis associated with multiple types of cancer.46, 47, 48 Bulk-seq analyses of TCGA datasets demonstrated that mesenchymal GBM subtypes expressed higher T cells and myeloid cell markers and revealed a strong correlation between T cells and macrophages (Figure 3c-d).

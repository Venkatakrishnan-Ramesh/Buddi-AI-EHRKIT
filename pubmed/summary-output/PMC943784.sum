This implies that peptides that are considered to be non-binders by the NetMHCpan-4.1 prediction method can potentially become likely binders if their gene expression value is sufficiently high.FigureÂ 1Relationship between predicted HLA binding scores of MS eluted ligands and artificially generated random negatives and the gene expression values of their corresponding source proteinsNetMHCpan-4.1 EL percentile rank scores and RNA-Seq expression values were binned to generate a 2-dimensional array where EL percentile rank scores are shown on the x-axis and TPM values on the y-axis.

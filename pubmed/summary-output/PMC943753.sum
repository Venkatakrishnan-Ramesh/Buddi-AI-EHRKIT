In the postoperative period, patients should not begin active internal rotation until the osteotomy has healed at 6 weeks, as this can damage LTO repair and result in subscapularis failure.Table 1Pearls and PitfallsPearls•With the arm in external rotation and slight abduction, the cleft between the lesser tuberosity and humeral head osteophytes must be palpated beneath the subscapularis tendon to determine the site of the LTO with a total of 2 cm bone block removed•During the capsulectomy procedure, electrocautery should be followed along the humeral shaft rather than following the osteophytes to avoid injury of the axillary nerve•Axillary nerve should be palpated several times during the capsulectomy and always protected with blunt retractors to avoid injury•Curved scissors should be used to assist in developing the plane between the capsule and subscapularis•A Cobb elevator can be useful in creating tension between the capsular and subscapularis plane.•Release and excise the capsule from the subscapularis before performing the humeral head cutPitfalls•Creating an LTO that is too large increases the risk of fracture and a small LTO can inhibit sufficient bone-to-bone healing resulting in failure•Injury to the axillary nerve if not continuously protected or in the incorrect plane•Beginning active internal rotation too early in the postoperative period can damage the LTO repair and result in subscapularis failureLTO, lesser tuberosity osteotomy.

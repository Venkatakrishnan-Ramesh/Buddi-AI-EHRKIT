While all these factors are known to be involved in the recognition and degradation of ERAD-L substrates (Christianson et al., 2011), we also observed that knockdown of the putative membrane-integral ER quality control factor Bap29 (Abe et al., 2009) and the rhomboid protease RHBDL4 (Fleig et al., 2012) caused a modest increase in the MHC202 steady-state level.

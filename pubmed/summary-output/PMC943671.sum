To overcome this disadvantage, the LINAC, which is more commonly used in clinics, has been applied in rats.30,31 This model uses a single beam delivery but suffers toxicity such as moist desquamation dermatitis from a 60 Gy treatment.20 This may limit the maximum deliverable dose using a single beam, which is undesirable when studying radionecrosis induced by higher doses such as 140 Gy used in the SRS treatment of patients with tremors.8,20 Moreover, rats are relatively more expensive and less used than mouse models particularly in cancer research.

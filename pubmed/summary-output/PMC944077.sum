In the first step, the molecular coupling is established between MIDAS and the allosteric sites—the N-terminal of the α1, α6, and α7 helices—producing the basal integrin affinity; the second step progressively enhanced the αX I-domain affinity toward the high-affinity state, and the transition period between the two steps is in the range encompassing physiological Mg2+ concentrations.

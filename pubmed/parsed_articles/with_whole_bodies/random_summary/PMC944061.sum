Compared with wild-type control mice, the expression level of BiP, CHOP, TRIB3, and CHAC1, genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and the UPR, were highly upregulated in Jamc−/− lenses, suggesting that abnormal lens development was accompanied by UPR activation.All animal experiments adhered to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the animal research ethics committee at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University.Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and imaged using an upright microscope (ZEISS Axio Imager 2; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Zena, Germany).Differential expression was assessed by DESeq2 using read counts as input.We first detected the expression pattern of JAM-C in different development stages of WT mouse lenses.Barely positive immunofluorescence signals were detected in lens epithelium or lens fiber cells of P7 Jamc−/− lenses, which confirmed the deletion of JAM-C (Fig.NS, not significant; n = 3.To further investigate the morphological defects of Jamc−/− mouse lenses, H&E staining was used in cross-sections of eyeballs from Jamc−/− mice and their control littermates at different stages (Fig.Similarly, compared with WT control lenses, PDI staining was increased in the presumptive OFZ of Jamc−/− lenses (Figs.(E, F) Decreased LAMP1 (red) level and retained LAMP1 staining in the center of the Jamc−/− lens.DAPI-stained nuclei are blue.6B).More research involving the roles of JAM-C in lens development and its potential role in clinical prediction in cataract will be implemented in the future.

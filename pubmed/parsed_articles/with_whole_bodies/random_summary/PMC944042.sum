The temperature of the column was 60C.B) Production of other tricarboxylic acid cycle derived organic acids at minor levels.Activated pathways tend to be involved in utilization of alternative carbon sources (Table 3) while the most significantly up-regulated individual metabolic genes are involved in terreic acid biosynthesis (513675, 172x; 283888, 27x) and itaconic acid biosynthesis (531880, 92x; 505023, 50x; 497765, 33x; 466479, 15x).Table 2Gene ontology term enrichment in LaeA overexpression strain transcriptome.Carbohydrate active enzymes that significantly change in response to LaeA overexpression.4Extracellular metabolomics.Kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors were predicted from the genome of A. pseudoterreus.We found that laeA is required for high production of itaconic acid and that overexpression makes itaconic acid production from a mixed glucose/xylose sugar stream more robust to the presence of excess phosphate or mixed nutrients from yeast extract (Fig.

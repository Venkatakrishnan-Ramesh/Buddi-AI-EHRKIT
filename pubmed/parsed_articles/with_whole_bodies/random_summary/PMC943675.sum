For example, amastigote forms of the parasite invade macrophages, and express surface molecules that engage phagocytic receptors that promote ‘silent’ or anti-inflammatory cell invasion, typically observed with the engulfment of apoptotic cells (Guy and Belosevic, 1993; Love et al., 1998; Peters et al., 1995; Wanderley et al., 2009, 2012).(C and D) 61 hits were validated with independent dsRNAs and then examined for their effect on the internalization of E. coli and S. aureus particles.The final list of Leishmania specific hits is composed of 52 genes with human homologs displayed on the left side of the Figure 1D.Heat shock induced a strong SUMOylation of high molecular weight proteins in non-infected cells (NI) and only slightly in infected cells.in SUMO-depleted cells, including significantly increased parasite loads when normalized relative to 2 h p.i.Cells were split 1:10 when the cultures reached 100% confluence.

However, cryptogenic stroke accounts for about 25% of all cerebral infarctions, and the concept of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) has been gaining ground in recent years.1).MRI showed occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and acute infarction in the territory (Fig.Very mild stenosis was observed at the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery, but the margins were smooth, and there was no floating thrombus or ulcer lesion.The MCA was completely recanalized (TICI 3), and the symptoms tended to improve immediately (Fig.Ultrasonography of carotid artery showed no vulnerable plaque or floating thrombus.By contrast, the insert immunohistochemistry with CD42b showed that the platelet component was quite minimal (Fig.E, F: The insert immunohistochemistry with CD42b shows the poor platelet content within the thrombus (original magnification ×10, ×100).Cholesterol crystals are commonly found in progressive atherosclerotic lesions.The histopathologic composition of the recovered thrombus and the etiology of stroke have been the subject of numerous studies.The other authors have no competing of interest to declare.

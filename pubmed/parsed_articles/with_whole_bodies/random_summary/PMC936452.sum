However, there were no differences in total postoperative morphine consumption between the two groups.The uncontrolled pain could promote the development of chronic persistent pain and worsen independence, mood, and quality of life (2).The study was conducted in 2021.The sample size was chosen as recommended for pilot studies within the range of 8 - 20.Before induction, the first blood sample was taken and placed in a cooler with 4Â°C temperature.Intubation was facilitated with rocuronium 0.8 - 1.2 mg/kg BW.In the USG guided modified-TLIP block group, the local anesthetic agent was administered between m. longissimus and m. iliocostalis both sides of the medial to the lateral direction dengan bupivacaine 20 cc 0.25%.At the end of the surgery, the participant was extubated, and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine IV (1 mg/mL concentration, demand dose, 1 mg, lockout interval (LOI) 10 minutes with maximum dose of 10 mg/4 hours) was started.TLIP block is an interfascial block of choice for perioperative pain management in spine surgery, either classic TLIP or modified TLIP (16).A prolonged increase in IL-6 is directly proportional to postoperative pain and morbidity (17-19).In line with this result, we found that NRS in the modified TLIP group was also lower in the modified TLIP group 12 hours postoperatively.IL-6 levels might be an additional tool to total 24-h morphine consumption and NRS value in measuring postoperative pain.First, this was a pilot study that involved only limited subjects.Second, we did not measure other pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines.Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to assess the postoperative analgesic effect of classic and modified TLIP blocks.

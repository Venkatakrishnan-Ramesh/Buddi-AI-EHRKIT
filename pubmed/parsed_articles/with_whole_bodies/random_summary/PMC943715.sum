The acute, isolated event of CSCR mostly resolves spontaneously, but the chronic variant of the disease, which is also known as diffuse retinal pigment epitheliopathy, is progressive and can lead to severe bilateral visual impairment [2].The authors had noted platelet aggregates in choriocapillaris in experimental studies on radiation choroidopathy [6].These changes were secondary to high dosage (69.9 Gy) used to treat choroidal melanoma.Since beta radiation dose decreases as a function of 1/r2 with increasing distance from the source, the optic nerve receives about 2.4 Gy, and the lens only 0.56 mGy (threshold for cataract formation is 2 Gy) [8].The mechanism of action in this case would likely be due to the effect of radiation on the endothelial cells.1).

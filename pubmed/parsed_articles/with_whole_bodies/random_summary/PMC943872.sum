Despite all the attention focused on COVID-19 hospital admissions and mortality rates, relatively little attention has been paid to readmission rates after a COVID-19 hospitalization.It is unknown whether current readmission prediction equations1 are appropriate for the risk stratification of COVID-19 survivors.Of note, the median length of stay for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 differs among countries, but is less than 9 days in most countries;20 thus, the CIHI definition of 30 days or less as a “typical” admission was felt to be an appropriate a priori length of stay for COVID-19 admissions.Although our primary analysis focused on CIHI-defined typical hospital admissions of 30 days or less,19 we also explored outcomes in patients with “atypical” index admissions of longer than 30 days in a sensitivity analysis.As privacy laws preclude the sharing of health data across provincial boundaries, the Alberta analyses were conducted within the Alberta Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research Data and Research Services team and the Ontario analyses were performed at ICES.The multivariable model incorporating these factors had a c-statistic of 0.73 in both Alberta and Ontario (Table 3).Thus, current system approaches to transitioning patients from hospital to home do not appear to need adjustment.

It is therefore of interest to develop an animal model of brain radionecrosis in both rats and mice that allows high maximum doses with minimal toxicity to the animals.Panel, C, shows a representative time course in Gd-T1w images in a 140 Gy mouse.Fig 3.Total distance is the Euclidean norm of the points.5Example slides using hematoxylin and eosin staining in 140 Gy mice, A, and rats B.One 60 Gy mouse was sacrificed without imaging before the 8-month timepoint due to severe hemorrhage.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to generate radionecrosis in mouse brains using a clinical LINAC.Successful delivery using a wide range of doses (60-140 Gy) demonstrates the flexibility of this method to accommodate even the ultrahigh doses used in patients to date.Gamma Knife has successfully delivered high doses (60 Gy prescribed at the 50% isodose line) to small volumes in mice,22 but clinical Gamma Knife generally suffers from a lower dose rate than LINAC-based methods36 and may prolong an animal's time under anesthesia.Furthermore, an in vivo model accurately replicating human therapies, which can be monitored over time by imaging histology or imaging, allows for better testing of drugs and novel imaging methods.

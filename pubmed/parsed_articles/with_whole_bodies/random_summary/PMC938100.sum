The studies outlined in this review reveal how chronic pain is not only confined to alterations in the nervous system and presents findings on new treatment targets and for this debilitating disease.Neutrophils are the earliest recruited innate immune cell, infiltrating tissues from the blood in response to tissue injury.Activated macrophages can modulate pain dependent on their class, one of which is the pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype, while the other anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes [63].Thus, targeting these pathways may offer up broad treatments for chronic pain pathologies.Connexins are the most abundant, including Cx26, Cx30, Cx32, Cx36, Cx37, Cx43, Cx45 and Cx46 in neurons and SGCs in DRG and TG.

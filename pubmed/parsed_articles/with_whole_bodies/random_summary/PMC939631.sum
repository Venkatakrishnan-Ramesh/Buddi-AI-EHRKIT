Adenovirus was detected in 62.2% of the analyzed samples.No other clear epidemiological risk factors have been identified to date.The cases reported in the European Union included children between 1 month and 16 years of age.Thus, at this time, the etiology of the current cases of hepatitis is still considered unknown and remains under active investigation.The UK has established a case definition and has developed a survey for the investigation of cases that meet the definition, which have been shared by the IHR with the rest of the countries.12 The provisional confirmed case definition is a person presenting, after January 1, 2022 with an acute hepatitis which was not caused by hepatitis A–E viruses, or an expected presentation of metabolic, inherited or genetic, congenital or mechanical cause with serum transaminases >500 IU/L (AST or ALT), and ≤10 years of age.The Epi-linked case definition is a person presenting after January 1, 2022 with acute non-A–E hepatitis who is a close contact of a confirmed case.In the remaining 27 countries, the cumulative number of cases of this variant ranged from 0.5 to 5.5 million.The hypothesis is complex, but whether children with acute hepatitis are carriers of SARS-CoV-2 in the stool, and whether evidence of superantigen-mediated immune activation is found, needs further investigation.

Meanwhile, the N-linked glycan sites on the S2 subunit were conserved with respect to both the glycan processing state and the position of the N-linked glycan sequons.This analysis demonstrated two extremes, either an N-linked glycan site was conserved in the majority of strains analyzed, or highly variable between strains.The HRV-3C protease cleavage site, 6Ã—His-Tag and AviTag spaced by GS linkers were added to the C terminus for protein purification and biotinylation.The denatured proteins were alkylated by adding 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) and incubated for 1h in the dark, followed by a 1h incubation with 20 mM DTT to eliminate residual IAA.Stepped HCD collision energy was set to 15, 25 and 45% and the MS2 for each energy was combined.The precursor mass tolerance was set at 4 ppm and 10 ppm for fragments.

SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) was first reported in December 2019 in China.The first classified VOC was named Alpha (B.1.1.7).Copies/mL were calculated following the subtraction of the initial virus applied.(F) % Neutralization was calculated using the results from E and IC50 (in ug/mL) was calculated from %Neutralization.Using sequencing, we identified 5 nasopharyngeal samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals which contained the Wild Type sub lineage B.1.1.50 (hCoV-19/Israel/CVL-45526-ngs/2020), Alpha, B.1.1.7 (hCoV-19/Israel/CVL-46879-ngs/2020), Beta B.1.351 (hCoV-19/Israel/CVL-2557-ngs/2020), Delta, B.1.617.2 (hCoV-19/Israel/CVL-12804/2021), Omicron BA.1, B.1.1.529 (hCoV-19/Israel/CVL-n49814/2021), Omicron BA.2 (hCoV-19/Israel/CVL-n51046/2022) variants.In brief, 2 ug/mL of ACE2-Ig or negative control protein (hFc) was coated on high-binding ELISA plates (MICROLON High Binding, Greiner Bio-One, Kremsm√ºnster, Austria) in carbonate/bicarbonate coating buffer pH 9.6.The resulting lentiviruses were used to infect 293T cells.

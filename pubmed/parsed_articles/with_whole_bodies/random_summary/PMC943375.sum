The willingness-to-pay for genetic testing features of physical traits, personality, and dietary recommendation were estimated to be 90, 107, and 220 CNY, respectively.The nature of big genomic data makes DTC-GT have the potential to aid in the advancement of precision public health through more precise disease prevention and control strategies.We applied the D-optimal procedure to generate a total of 8 choice tasks by using JMP (Version 13, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).This research used the mixed logit model that allowed for random parameters and heterogeneous preferences to estimate attribute coefficients, price elasticity of demand, as well as willingness-to-pay (WTP) for different features in DTC-GT services.Overall, 69.1% of DTC-GT users reported knowing DTC-GT services very well, compared to only 13.9% of non-DTC-GT users; 71.8% of DTC-GT users have at least one friend or relative who also has taken DTC-GT services, and the proportion is much lower among non-DTC-GT users (14.6%), which is consistent with the classic theory of diffusion of innovation (9).In terms of result interpretation, respondents have a slightly higher preference for having the information by words rather than by staff or AI.As illustrated in Figure 1, aligned with the aims of Healthy China 2030, health equity could be advanced through targeted interventions on the basis of both longitudinal behavioral records and genetic data obtained from DTC-GT of subpopulations in the future.Second, the sample was not nationally representative and more studies are needed to generalize our findings.

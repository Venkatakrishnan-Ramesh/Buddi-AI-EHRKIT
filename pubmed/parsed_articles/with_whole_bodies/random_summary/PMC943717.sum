In the mixed-effects models, MV in the 6-mm circle presented the strongest correlation with leakage scores, which explained 57% of the variation in leakage (p < 0.001).Meanwhile, it is limited for assessment if the haze is mild, in particular, scoring 0.5 or 1 on the ordinal scale (4 being the maximum) [2, 6].1a Illustration of the major landmarks of the retina and their positions.Spectral-domain OCT showed an intra-retinal cyst.Random effects included a patient-specific effect to allow for the within-patient variation over time and a nested effect to adjust for the correlation between eyes from the same patient.Fixed effects included the time (in months), OCT metrics, the interaction term between OCT metrics and time, age, gender, BCVA, and whether the eye had treatment of local enhancement or not.SD standard deviation, BCVA best corrected visual acuity, CST central subfield thickness, MV macular volume, VH vitreous haze, HLA-B27 human leukocyte antigen B27, IQR interquartile range.At baseline, cystoid macular edema was noted on optical coherence tomography with a central subfield thickness (CST) of 336 μm (c) and macular volume (MV) in the 6mm circle of 11.35 mm3 (b).At the initial visit, the fluorescein angiographic image showed diffuse vascular leakage (a).5).In patients with uveitis and no or trace of vitreous haze, the inflammation of the vasculitis may be underestimated if not performing FA examination.OCT MV is not an absolute proxy for FA, especially for the initial diagnosis of retinal vascular leakage.In our clinic practice, OCT volume scans were performed on follow-up visits.

The gap between the supply and demand for deceased donor organs is increasing worldwide, while patients on waiting lists for organ transplantation die.The main questions were as follows:.The analysis of the transcripts was carried out by TB and CO with MAXQDA2020, and followed the “Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research” (COREQ)-Statement.16.Most participants had great difficulties when it came to defining clear limitations for the allocation of donor organs to individual patients with specific characteristics because in their view everybody deserves to live and thus to be granted the same survival chances.The longer you wait, the greater the pressure on the patient increases, both morally and organically.– Interview 05.Especially with such comorbidities.– Interview 08.To date, there is still a substantial lack of knowledge on patients’ views and beliefs on ethical deceased donor organ allocation for transplantation.They acknowledged the divergence of these two ethically conflicting allocation goals during the interviews, and when asked how to handle the situation, they often argued that these decisions should ultimately be made by physicians.At the moment, the broad consensus in the Western world is that everybody should receive the best possible medical treatment regardless of their condition.However, this consensus is currently challenged due to increasing economic pressures and ethical concerns that typically arise in the treatment of the terminally ill or in the treatment of patients with a very limited prognosis.This situation raises serious ethical questions in distributive justice and priority setting for donor organ allocation.

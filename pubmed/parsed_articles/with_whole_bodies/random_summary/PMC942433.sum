Cell lines were sub-cultured every 2 or 3 days.High titer replication defective lentiviral vectors were produced and concentrated before use.Variable domains of anti-PD-L1 antibody were obtained by phage display as previously described (Choi et al., 2020).Tumor length, height, and width were measured using calipers and the tumor volume was calculated as 1/6π×length (mm)×height (mm)×width (mm).A Percoll gradient from GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA) was then used to separate cancer cells and enrich lymphocytes.Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests were used when the data had a Gaussian distribution with similar variances.The T cells are usually co-incubated with the beads coated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies or soluble anti-CD3 antibody with IL-2 to achieve the required activation during the manufacturing process of therapeutic CAR-T cells (Li and Kurlander, 2010; Zhang et al., 2017).Therefore, treatment of anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies with T cells before incubation with BiTE molecules was carried out in our experiment for the relevant T cell activation (Fig.However, there was significant increase in the level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes having effector memory phenotype (CD62Llow CD8+) in mice treated with BiTE:OT-1 than the group with only OT-1 treatment (Fig.4A).4B).In addition, this result implies that the BiTE binding strategy discussed in this study could be incorporated into CAR-T cell therapy.

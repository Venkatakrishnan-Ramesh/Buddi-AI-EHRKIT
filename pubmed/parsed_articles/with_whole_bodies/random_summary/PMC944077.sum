The difference in ΔTm of 10°C and ΔΔHunfolding of 22.9 kcal/mol between the Mg2+-bound and -free states reflects a more enhanced global stability of the αX I-domain, but not the energetic contribution from the little-to-no structural rearrangements or fast-local motions within MIDAS during Mg2+ binding.The observed thermodynamics differences in our isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis between Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ also would result from differences in their physicochemical properties.In general, the binding enthalpy describes the favorability of the molecular interactions via hydrophilic, H-bonding, electrostatic interactions, and conformational changes of interacting molecules while the binding entropy arises from restructuring water and ions and hydrophobic effects (Dutta et al., 2015).This scenario is supported by a sharp decline in the external ligand affinity in vitro affinity assays and the lack of a MIDAS cation in crystal lattices in the reduced pH of 5 (Dong et al., 2012, 2014).After 48 hours of transfection, cells in a 24 well plate were washed once with Hepes-Buffered Saline (HBS) and incubated with 1mM Mn2+/0.2mM Ca2+ and varying Mg2+/1mM Ca2+ for 30 mins at room temperature.All binding data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean.

Patient is in supine position with the legs spread.Patient is in supine position with the legs spread.The tumor is slowly freed from the soleus muscle by finger dissection (Fig 5).Fig 5Endoscopically assisted resection of intramuscular lipoma of the soleus of the left leg.(A) The split soleus muscle is retracted with small retractor to expose the lipoma.L, lipoma; PMP, proximal medial portal.TableÂ 2Pearls and Pitfalls of Endoscopically Assisted Resection of Intramuscular Lipoma of the SoleusPearlsPitfalls1.The identification of the interface between the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles should be begun at the distal medial portal2.The proximal medial portal is better established under endoscopic guide.3.Blunt dissection of the lipoma close to the fibular head region can minimize the risk of injury to the common peroneal nerve.1.Endoscopically assisted resection for infiltrating intramuscular lipoma may have a high risk of recurrence.2.Wrong entry to the interface between the deep and superficial posterior compartments of the calf may lead to injury to the tibial neurovascular bundle.The distal medial portal is the viewing portal, and the proximal medial portal is the working portal.

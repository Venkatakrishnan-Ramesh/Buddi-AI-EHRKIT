Diagnosis is best made using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but can be made with ultrasound.The patient made a full recovery after conservative management.Of the potential aetiologies, iliopsoas tendon injuries are extremely uncommon, with an estimated prevalence of 0.66% (3).Iliopsoas injuries are typically secondary to trauma, especially in young athletes.Two weeks after her falls, she was initially evaluated at an unafilliated emergency department.3).Anteroposterior (AP) X-ray of the hips demonstrating degenerative changes at the femoracetabular joint (arrow).(a) Sagittal T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image of the left hip demonstrating hyperintense oedema in the left iliopsoas (asterisk) muscle tracking proximally.Complete iliopsoas tendon ruptures (without avulsion) have also occasionally been seen in patients with total hip arthroplasties (12, 13).Of the few reported cases, a delay in diagnosis is relatively common (7, 14).A small study of 19 military subjects demonstrated that MRI was 100% accurate in delineating the aetiology of acute hip pain, including iliopsoas tear injuries, in young endurance athletes (15).Although the participants in this study were of a young and athletic population, multiple case studies have demonstrated the ability of MRI to diagnose iliopsoas tears in the older adult population (3, 4, 6, 8, 13, 14).With the recent advent of diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound, a skilled ultrasonographer may be able to diagnose this solely by ultrasound (16, 17).However, due to the depth of the iliopsoas tendon and associated haematoma, which may obscure the ultrasound signal, the authors consider that MRI remains the gold standard to diagnose this injury.Evidence from relevant case reports suggests that complete iliopsoas tears can also be treated conservatively without surgical intervention (3, 4, 6â€“8, 12, 14).The true incidence is probably under-reported, highlighting the need for heightened awareness of this injury, especially in females over the age of 65 years with any history of injury, even a minor injury or incidental fall.Treatment is generally conservative, involving dedicated physical therapy, assistive devices for ambulation, and pain management.

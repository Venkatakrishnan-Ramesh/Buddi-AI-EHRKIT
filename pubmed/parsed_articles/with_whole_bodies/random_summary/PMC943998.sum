Body weight was the only significant covariate identified.Data from three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02614547, NCT02942004, NCT02942017) [14, 15]; one open-label study (NCT02285504) [21]; and one open-label study of healthy lactating women (547-CLP-108; current study; see Electronic Supplementary Materials [ESM]) were used to evaluate the PopPK properties of brexanolone.A PopPK model describing brexanolone PK in plasma and breast milk was developed using the current study and supported by phase II/III data (N = 156; see ESM for details on study characteristics, PK sampling, and model development).Breast milk was collected pre-infusion, at least every 12 h between hour 0 and hour 72, and on days 4, 5, 6, and 7.3a).Fig.3A PopPK model of breast milk and plasma allopregnanolone levels.PopPK population pharmacokinetics.Simulated allopregnanolone concentrations in a breast milk and b plasma using median values and the 5th and 95th percentiles from the final model.Individual points correspond to observed data from Study 547-CLP-108.PopPK population pharmacokinetics, PPD postpartum depression.Plasma concentrations of allopregnanolone exhibited linear PK, and the temporal profile in breast milk paralleled the plasma profile closely, albeit with slightly higher concentrations.

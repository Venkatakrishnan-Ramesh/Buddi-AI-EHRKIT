The pressure increased at the rate about of 600 MPa/min and held for 5 min at 600 MPa (Li et al., 2021).The analyses for each extract were conducted in triplicate.The results showed that TP treatment changed the structure of pepper cells, allowing for facilitated continued acidification during processing (Kamat et al., 2018).A total of 99 volatile compounds were detected in all treatment groups (untreated, TP, HPP, and SMS group), including 44 esters, 20 alkanes, 14 terpenes, 8 alcohols, 7 aldehydes, 2 acids, 1 ketone, 1 furan, 1 pyrazine, and 1 ether.The different treatment groups are represented by differently shaped symbols.However, a few compounds clustered around different treatment groups, demonstrating that the concentration of these compounds increased after corresponding processing technologies.Furthermore, 13-methyltetradecanal was observed with a higher concentration in TP, HPP, and SMS groups, respectively, which could relate to lipid oxidation (Xia et al., 2020).5 showed that esters were the main compounds clearly decreasing with the increase of storage temperature, including hexyl isobutyrate, methyl salicylate, 4-methylpentyl 2-methylbutanoate, 4-methylpentyl 3-methylbutanoate, hexyl 2-methylbutyrate, hexyl 3-methylbutanoate, 4-methylpentyl 4-methylpentanoate, and 4-methylpentyl 8-methylnon-6-enoate.TP clearly reduced the concentration of esters and aldehydes, but promoted the production of some terpenoids.

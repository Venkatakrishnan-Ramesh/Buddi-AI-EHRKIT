In this paper, we present the costs of surgical health benefit packages (HBPs) for secondary care in public district hospitals.The costs were estimated using mixed (top-down and bottom-up) micro-costing methods.Provision of safe, timely and affordable access to surgical care is a key strategy to achieve universal health coverage in low-and middle-income countries.The phase II of the Costing of Health Services (CHSI) study—a nationally representative study, is the first in India to generate evidence on cost of surgical care in public sector secondary care hospitals.The cost evidence presented in our paper is critical for the implementation of the India’s national insurance program (AB PM-JAY) including its price setting, planning to scale-up public sector district hospitals to provide comprehensive surgical care, as well as determining efficiency of surgical interventions.A detailed description of sources of data, prices of input resources, apportioning of shared costs, assumptions and the data analysis were published in the protocol, process evaluation and CHSI phase I results paper [15–17].Therefore, the present study used reimbursement rates from a national health insurance scheme, CGHS (Central Government Health Scheme), which provides comprehensive medical care to central government employees and pensioners.Therefore, practically the provisioning of surgical care starts at the level of the district hospital in India.Evidence on the cost of surgical care at public secondary care hospitals is crucial for the implementation of AB PM-JAY and subsequent revision of reimbursement prices, planning augmentation of the capacity at district hospitals to provide comprehensive surgical care and cost data that will be useful for HTA researchers and hospital planners.The cost information generated as part of the CHSI phase II will be subsequently fed into the national cost database of India [14].It will provide guidance for evidence-based scale-up of secondary care surgical services at district hospitals.A possible strategy to strengthen the district hospitals is to reserve the secondary care HBPs for the district hospitals.This would in turn make the AB PM-JAY a vehicle to strengthen the public health system at the district level.

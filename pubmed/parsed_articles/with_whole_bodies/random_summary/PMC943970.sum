In addition, allergic asthma is usually persistent and typically continues into adulthood as a chronic condition, cooccurring with several diseases, such as allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.2 In recent decades, the mechanisms of allergic asthma have been extensively studied.The following exclusion criteria were used: (I) mycoplasma or virus-induced asthma; (II) specific IgE tests for multiple allergens or non-house dust mite allergens.Healthy children (n=3): Control1, Control2, and Control3; Allergic asthma (n=3): case1, case2, and case3.We mapped the clean reads to the Rfam database for annotation processing to assess the efficiency of small RNA sequencing in detecting miRNAs, and this analysis eventually detected several types of small RNAs, including rRNA, scRNA, Cis-reg, snRNA, tRNA, repeats, unannotated, and others.We identified conserved miRNAs and novel miRNAs using the miRBase v21.0 database (http://www.mirbase.org/) and mirdeep2, respectively, to elucidate the role of miRNAs in regulating allergic asthma in children and obtained at least 1076 conserved miRNAs and 593 novel miRNAs in each of the small RNA libraries (Table S3).On the other hand, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapping has been used to analyze mRNA products and functions during metabolic processes (Table 3).They suggested correlations between miRNA expression and seasonal asthma symptoms: reduced let-7d-3p expression and increased asthma symptoms in the spring, and increased miR-328-3p expression and increased asthma symptoms in the autumn.20 The indispensable position of an miRNA in the development and progression of allergic asthma was established based on theoretical and experimental evidence.Importantly, ceRNA is an important direction for studying the regulation of differentially expressed miRNAs.Thus, more research is warranted to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms of differentially expressed miRNAs and ceRNAs associated with allergic asthma in children.

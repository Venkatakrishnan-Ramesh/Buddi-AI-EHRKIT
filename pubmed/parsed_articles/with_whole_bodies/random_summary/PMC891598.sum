While most small, regulatory RNAs are thought to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein.A ΔazuCR ΔglpD double mutant did not show the increase in activity upon AzuC overexpression, showing the increase in dehydrogenase activity was due to GlpD (Fig.The mutations in the cadA-gfp translational fusion and AzuCRL3STOP are indicated (A).We show the AzuC protein binds GlpD, an enzyme at the junction of respiration, glycolysis, and phospholipid biosynthesis, and increases dehydrogenase activity (Fig.

Microscopic characters were studied with standard light microscopy methods.Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic reconstruction was performed in PhyML v. 3.1 (Guindon et al.9.0 × 6.4 μm; Q = 1.16–1.62, Qav = 1.4, heterodiametrical, (5–)6(–7)-angled in side view.Pileus 10–40 mm diam, convex to conico-convex then applanate, sometimes depressed to umbilicate at the centre, not hygrophanous, not translucently striate or up to half the radius in well hydrated specimens, vivid blue (Italian collection) to dark blue or blue grey, almost black at centre, paler, more grey-tinged in old specimens, especially at the margin, finely fibrillose-tomentose, more squamulose towards the centre.Lamellae adnate to subdecurrent, relatively distant and thick, sometimes ventricose, rarely anastomosing, white to pale grey then with pink tinges, rarely with blue tinges (Italian collection), with entire, concolourous edges, or sometimes with grey-blue tones in old specimens.Known from Spain and Italy.Basidiospores 7.5–10(–10.5) × 5.0–7.0 μm, av.Context very thin and brittle, deep bluish when young.Pileipellis a trichoderm of strongly inflated clavate to spheropedunculate elements, up to 30 μm wide.

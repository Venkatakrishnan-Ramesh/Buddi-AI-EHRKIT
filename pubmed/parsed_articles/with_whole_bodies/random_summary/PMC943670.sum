The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has attempted to combat the low reporting of safety incidents by trainees by making patient safety a focus in the Clinical Learning Environment Review (CLER).9 Within the broad category of patient safety, the ACGME has specifically identified trainee participation in safety reporting as a key educational priority.10 To promote such participation, the ACGME mandates, as part of their Common Program Requirement Milestones, trainee participation in safety event recognition, reporting, and root cause analysis.11 Despite these coordinated national efforts, trainees continue to report less than their attending physician counterparts.8,10,12.1).On its own, this percentage is difficult to interpret, after all, pathology training programs are much smaller than those of internal medicine, for example.To further adjust for the effect of residency program size, we then compared the average number of incidents reported per trainee per year in pathology to the average number of incidents reported per trainee per year across all specialties.As noted previously in this report, studies suggest that errors in pathology may account for a third of all medical errors, yet pathology trainees report errors at one tenth the rate of trainees overall.The goals of this effort are worthwhile: to improve pathology trainee participation in safety event reporting, and therefore to improve Safety Culture, improve patient care, engage and involve trainees in care redesign, and comply with ACGME-mandated regulations on patient safety education.

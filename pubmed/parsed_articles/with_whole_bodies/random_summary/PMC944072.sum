Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 26 with a p-value <0.05 as statistically significant.After screening, 12 patients were included in this study with a mean age of 61.6 ± 19.0-year olds.The linear regression model revealed that STESS scores were significantly influenced by patients’ age (p = 0.004) and intra-hospital occurrence (IHO) of status epilepticus (p = 0.026).The following search terms were used in devising the search strategies for all the databases; “NORSE”, ‘new-onset refractory status epileptics, “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”.Two authors (AA and MAQ) screened the studies independently, while a third author (SST) was consulted when any disagreements were encountered.Steroids were administered for both COVID-19 and NORSE separately, accounting for 4 out of 12 patients (33.3%) and 6 out of 12 patients (50%), respectively.NCSE was the most prevalent kind of SE reported.In every case, many ASM were tried, but immunomodulating medications proved to be the most effective in curing the patient to the point of no recurrence.

This review aims to synthesize and prove the efficacy and further modification of this method so that it can be eligible for treatment and can also give data collection for the scientific community.Abstracts that were not relevant to the research objectives were excluded.Some transfected cells displayed RGC-specific expression patterns, including Brn3b, iSlet1, calretinin, and Tuj.And about 23% of Brn3b-positive RFC-like cells were obtained.The DKK1+ Noggin+ Lefty A/ATOH7-based RGC induction system can efficiently direct TiPSCs in differentiating RGC lineage, which could be of benefit to developing possible therapies for degenerative retinal diseases such as glaucoma.Silmara de Lima et al, 201213To determine whether axon regeneration due to RGCs activation can reach brain tissue, innervate the appropriate target area, and have a recovery function.ExperimentalAfter adequate stimulation, RGCs are able to regenerate axons of maximum length from the visual pathway to the lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus, and other visual centers and have demonstrated the feasibility of repairing the central circuit for vision after optic nerve damage in adult mammals.There is a possibility of an axon regeneration process in the optic nerve until it reaches its maximum length to the appropriate place so that it can restore visual function.Manuguerra-Gagne et al, 201311Evaluation of potential use of bone marrow cells and mechanisms involved in tissue repair in laser-induced open angle glaucoma (OAG).Experimentally used male C57BL/6 rats aged 6–8 weeks and female Norwegian Brown rats aged three months which were then induced to have ocular hypertension and glaucoma.Bone marrow cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) induce regeneration of the trabecular meshwork.This adhesion causes the aqueous humor to fail to reach the drainage system and the trabecular meshwork.18.This study has also proven that the longer the intraocular pressure increases, the higher the degree of retinal ganglion cell damage.20 However, data show as many as 30–40% of patients with glaucoma have normal intraocular pressure.

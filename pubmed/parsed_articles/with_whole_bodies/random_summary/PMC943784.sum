HLA presentation of peptides is a key prerequisite for the activation of T cells, which monitor the health and disease status of individual cells.All compiled MS datasets (datasets A-D) were used to construct this array.All models were trained and evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme that avoids similar peptides to be placed in different partitions, as described in the STAR Methods.Firstly, models trained on datasets including gene expression significantly (all p-values<0.05, two-tailed Binomial test) outperformed models without this feature.To investigate how this influences the model performance, an alternative recalibrated expression mapping strategy was implemented.The values of 95% were selected to tolerate a certain proportion of noise in the EL data (Alvarez et al., 2018).

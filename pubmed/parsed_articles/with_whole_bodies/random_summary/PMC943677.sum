Rather, each section provides a snapshot of an opportunity where text mining for ADRs could contribute to a specific aspect, often in combination with other AI and text mining technologies.Each contribution discusses a specific extraction task in the drug life cycle and provides a sampling of the multiple dimensions of the problem space, including:.Text mining applications can help improve the efficiency of PV activities throughout signal management.Each of these media requires its own monitoring procedures and infrastructure, leading to the creation of individual reports that can be tractable with NLP.For example, the complex and costly licensing landscape involved in the text mining of the full-text scientific literature prevents its establishment as a reference source.The third possible approach of utilizing existing automated methods to pre-annotate ADEs introduces biases of the utilized methods into the data set.Pre-annotation with existing systems can help with managing the cognitive overload that comes with the task complexity; however, it comes with its own downsides: the bias introduced by the system and complexity of correcting any pre-annotations to fit into the desired annotation schema.While the specific applications described above have focused on English language sources and resources, many of the relevant types of input are written in languages other than English.

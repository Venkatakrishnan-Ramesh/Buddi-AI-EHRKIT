The reversal posttranslational modification of ubiquitylation, deubiquitylation, is also important in the regulation of TOP2A function (Chen et al., 2015).(E) Relative GINS1 mRNA expression in glioma specimens of low clinical grades and high clinical grades determined by real-time PCR.β-actin was used as loading control.Bar graph data are presented as the mean ± SD; ∗, p < 0.05.The eluates were resolved by SDS–PAGE and silver-stained.USP15 overexpression significantly promoted the endogenous ubiquitination of TOP2A in A172 cells (Figure 6G).(E) Western blot analysis of the protein levels of GINS1, TOP2A, and USP15 in GINS1-silenced U251 cells transfected with USP15 shRNA.(F) Western blot analysis of the protein levels of GINS1, TOP2A, and USP15 in GINS1-overexpressing A172 cells transfected with USP15 cDNA.

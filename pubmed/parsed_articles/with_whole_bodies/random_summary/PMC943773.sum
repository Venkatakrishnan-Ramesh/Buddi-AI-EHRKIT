Researchers and steering group included Arabic, British Bangladeshi, British Pakistani, white British and white Irish ethnic groups.Ten of the 14 domains were mapped to the following topics explored in the interviews and focus groups (FGs) and/or raised by participants: knowledge about COVID-19 vaccination; beliefs about consequences of COVID-19 infection and vaccination; optimism that a vaccine would help solve the pandemic (optimism); feelings about being offered a COVID-19 vaccine (two domains: emotion and memory, attention and decision-making); reasons for or against accepting a COVID-19 vaccine (three domains: intentions, reinforcement and social influences); influences on decision-making (memory, attention and decision-making); groups to be prioritised (professional role and identity); and where to receive the vaccine if willing (environmental context and resources).Findings were discussed weekly by researchers and four times with the study steering group.Coding consensus was reached between the four researchers.All participants involved in the study provided informed consent, including the use of anonymised transcript quotes in reporting and publications.There was general agreement across ethnic minority and white British groups on preferred places to receive the vaccine, including community healthcare settings and settings perceived as low risk, for example, a space with less people.Many participants across ethnic minority and white British groups reported comparing stories with friends and family, often via WhatsApp and other social media channels.This has been found in several other studies of the general population, healthcare workers, immunocompromised and parents.6 31 39 Easy access will be important to facilitate vaccination uptake for those with risk due to occupation or comorbidity.25 Our study and others certainly indicated that many would prefer a local, low-risk community healthcare setting with convenience of booking appointments.35 40 41 However, at the time of our data collection, access to vaccines was not a tangible issue as they had not yet been approved.This captures a baseline snapshot of attitudes, providing the option to explore and assess the impact of such interventions.

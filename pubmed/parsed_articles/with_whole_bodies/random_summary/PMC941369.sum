Our study applied smartphone mobility data to simulate the second wave spreading of COVID-19 in January 2021 in three major metropolitan statistical areas (Columbia, Greenville, and Charleston) in South Carolina, United States.We also found that the households of lower socioeconomic status may be an umbrella against infection due to fewer visits to places such as malls and restaurants associated with their low financial status.Direct human physical contact can accelerate COVID-19 transmission (Tian et al.2020).In general, there is a dearth of studies exploring the relationships between human mobility and COVID-19 transmission at the neighborhood level, especially in less populous metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).2021).For example, elementary schools with large infection cases may need special attention to decrease the spreading of the virus.2021) based on mobility data and the SEIR model to estimate transmission rates and infection counts in neighborhoods and POIs.A few CBGs had dramatically higher infections than others, while most CBGs had low infections less than 100.When zooming into the MSA level, the infection counts show different patterns.Several variables show significant correlations with CBG transmission rates, although the pattern varies among MSAs.Another issue is data sampling.

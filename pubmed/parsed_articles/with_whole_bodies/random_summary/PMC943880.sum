Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic with over 160 million confirmed cases worldwide and total deaths officially exceeding 3.3 million[1] as of May 2021, with United States of America and India having the greatest number of COVID-19-related deaths.Studies have demonstrated the use of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as one such tool.The data was analyzed on the basis of the trends of COVID-19-related deaths in patients with and without anemia, and comparing the presence or absence of anemia in those who survived or succumbed to COVID-19 during their ICU stay.Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS 25.0 software.Within the subgroups of male and female (without comorbidities except anemia), anemic males showed significantly increased deaths (P = 0.003930).While the ones who succumbed to the disease had a mean of 13.07 ± 9.01 symptomatic days and 7.44 ± 6.80 days of hospitalization.Assuming a hemoglobin concentration of 15 g/dl and an oxygen saturation of 99%, the oxygen concentration of arterial blood is approximately 20 ml of O2 per dL.We believe that anemia and its severity may prove resourceful in managing hospitalized patients.Estimation of hemoglobin on admission can be used as a tool for risk stratification in the upcoming waves of COVID-19.

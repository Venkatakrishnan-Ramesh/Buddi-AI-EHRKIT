Data are represented as mean ± SEM in b, d, h, i, and k. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed in b and i. ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer test was performed in d, h, and k.  (A) H–E staining of the lung shows that alveolar structures are relatively well maintained in the low-dose BLM model, whereas in the high-dose BLM model massive alveolar collapse occurs on day 21.(J and K) Immunofluorescence of the lung shows that Ki-67+ cells mostly appear in fibrotic areas.These results suggest that in mild lung injury, AT2 cells regenerate injured AT1 cells to recover alveolar epithelial integrity and prevent alveolar collapse.These results indicate that lung mesenchymal cells are activated in injured lungs to create a microenvironment that promotes the proliferation of AT2 cells.(D) At 3 dpt, a few GFP+ AT2 cell clusters were observed.For lung fibroblast isolation and analysis and cell sorting in the BLM model, protease solution [collagenase type I (450 U/ml; Gibco, Grand Island, NY) and dispase (5 U/ml; Corning, Corning, NY) in HBSS] was used, and whole lungs were incubated for 30 min at 37°C.The control group received 100 μL of PBS.

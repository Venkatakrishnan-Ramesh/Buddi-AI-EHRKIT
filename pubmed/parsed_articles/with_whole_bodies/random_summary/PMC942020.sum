Acinetobacter baumannii, as a nosocomial pathogen, causes various infections in different anatomical sites of the human body, such as skin, bloodstream, and urinary tract, with high mortality and morbidity rates (1, 2).In the first step, Vaxign (vaccine design webserver), a vaccine target prediction and analysis system based on the principle of reverse vaccinology, was used to select ideal putative immunogenic candidates.A total of 35 genome sequences of A. baumannii strains were selected from this database.According to VICMpred prediction, the aforementioned proteins are categorized as virulence factors, metabolic molecules, and cellular processes.According to the results from the STRING database, the uncharacterized protein with accession number ADX02417.1 had co-occurrence and neighborhood interactions with heme utilization protein.For example, OmpA is the most abundant OMP in A. baumannii and is involved in host-cell recognition, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance.showed that proteins involved in pilus assembly and four hypothetical proteins were likely immunogenic candidates.Furthermore, the aforementioned data suggest that in silico approaches might be helpful in discovering likely drug and immunogenic candidates that have been ignored up to now (33).This study identified three uncharacterized proteins as potential immunogenic candidates according to the defined criteria.This protein belongs to TonB-dependent receptors and is involved in zinc acquisition (39).In Gram-negative bacteria, the OM has an asymmetric structure, with lipopolysaccharides on the outer surface and phospholipids on the inner surface.Several studies have been conducted on the antigenic epitopes of A. baumannii.It should be considered that these epitopes are valuable resources for multiepitope target design (41).

Severe COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect people who are immunocompromised, although Canadian data in this context are limited.Data were analyzed to determine risk factors for oxygen requirement and other metrics of disease severity.Risk factors associated with needing (n = 190), compared with not needing (n = 319), supplemental oxygen included age (median 62.6 yr, interquartile range [IQR] 52.5–69.5 yr v. median 55.5 yr, IQR 47.5–66.5; p < 0.001) and number of comorbidities (median 3, IQR 2–3 v. median 2, IQR 1–3; p < 0.001), as well as parameters associated with immunosuppression.Recipients of lung transplants (n = 48) were more likely to have severe disease with a high mortality rate (n = 15, 31.3%) compared with recipients of other organ transplants, including kidney (n = 48, 14.8%), heart (n = 1, 4.4%), liver (n = 9, 11.4%) and kidney–pancreas (n = 3, 12.0%) transplants (p = 0.02).Over time, disease severity did not decline significantly.Despite therapeutic advances and vaccination of recipients of solid organ transplants, evidence of increased severity of COVID-19, in particular among those with lung transplants, supports ongoing public health measures to protect these at-risk people, and early use of COVID-19 therapies for recipients of solid organ transplants.1, 2020, to Nov. 30, 2021.At each site, data were systematically collected from the hospital’s electronic medical records or outpatient clinic records and entered into an electronic database using REDCap, which was housed at the central site (University Health Network, Toronto).Sites noted reduction of immunosuppression and the degree of reduction.To compare COVID-19 severity outcomes over time, we categorized the date of diagnosis in 4 different time periods (Mar.We performed all statistical analyses using IBM SPSS version 28.0 and Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp).Only 14 (2.8%) patients had received treatment for organ rejection in the 3 months before the COVID-19 diagnosis.Participants managed as outpatients were not treated with any specific therapy (including monoclonal antibodies, which had not been implemented during the study period).We observed a high rate of hospital admissions related to COVID-19 among transplant patients (54.2%), as well as long hospital stays (median 5 d, IQR 5–19 d).

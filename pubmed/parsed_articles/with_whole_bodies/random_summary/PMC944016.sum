Incremental analysis is presented summarizing the differences in costs and health benefits between the competing treatments as incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs; cost per QALY) for NIVO + IPI.Treatments were evaluated in patients with previously untreated unresectable stage III/IV melanoma.The dosage required for other infusion therapies (i.e., IPI and PEMBRO) was estimated using a mean patient weight of 79.2 kg and a body surface area of 1.91Â m2 based on the characteristics of patients in CheckMate 067.The recommended oral doses of BRAK + MEK inhibitor combinations were used in the cost calculations.Therefore, a mean duration of subsequent treatment of 4.9 months was assumed for all treatments (except for IPI, which was capped at 2.4 months, the mean duration from CheckMate 067) based on the estimated mean PFS reported for second-line therapy after anti-programmed death (PD)-1 treatment (NIVO or PEMBRO) reported in the literature [33].Progression status, baseline EQ-5D-3L, month prior to death, and assigned treatment were all significant predictors of utility over time.It is important to emphasize that survival parameters and treatment-specific disease management costs were varied in the PSA only.2.With a more traditional constant HR approach, the survival curves would not have adequately captured the existing evidence on the survival experience with both BRAF inhibitors and I-O therapies.

Mice were anesthetized using intraperitoneal injections of ketamine, 100 mg/kg, and xylazine, 10 mg/kg.Additionally, we conducted slit-lamp microscopy to determine any immune response to the injections.However, in the noninjected eye, the cornea continued to thicken with time (Fig 2C, D).Corneal endothelial peelings were isolated 4 weeks after AAV9 injection, and Wes immunoassay was conducted to determine the presence of the HA tag.Because Slc4a11 antibodies were not used to measure the transduction efficiency, determining whether the protein expression in the injected eyes was comparable to the WT corneal endothelium was not possible.In the young animals, slight upregulation of MCT1 and 2 protein levels was observed (Fig 5C, D); however, MCT4 expression increased significantly with AAV9-HA-Slc4a11 injection (Fig 5C, D).Cell membrane integrity is essential for the normal functioning of the endothelial pump.In the older animals, cell area was significantly altered between WT and KO animals.In the older animals, consistent with minimal improvement in corneal thickness, there was a small but not significant reduction in [lactate].This suggests that ROS quenching can temporarily preserve cell function until gene replacement is achieved.

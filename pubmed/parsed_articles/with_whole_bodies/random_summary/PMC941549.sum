We also provide evidence that explains why COVID-19 CFR has such dramatic changes at the beginning of a COVID-19 outbreak.Of these, six European countries, including Finland, Iceland, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and Malta, had some data missing for either weekends or certain days.To address this limitation in available data, we introduce a concept of ratio of total deaths to the sum of daily hospital occupancy (TDHOR) for a specific period.Length of stay in the hospital for deaths and discharges are useful fatality risk measurements for the COVID-19 pandemic because they reveal risk information for severe cases, which is missing in the CFR calculation.Several studies have addressed this at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak.22, 23.Linear regression was used to estimate average length of hospital stay for COVID-19 deaths and discharges.h, LTC CFR and LTC-to-total ratio for COVID-19 deaths in the US between 26 June 2020 and 1 March 2021.Range1-to-mean2 ratio is a new metric that directly reflects the range change in the stage one and mean change of stage 2.

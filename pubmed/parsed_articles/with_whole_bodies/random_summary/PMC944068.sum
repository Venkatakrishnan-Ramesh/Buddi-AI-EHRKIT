Skin infections need to be avoided, as these impair the healing process and contribute to the development of chronic wounds.6 The most frequently encountered bacteria in skin infections are Staphylococcus aureus strains including the methicillin resistant variant ─ MRSA.7 Other bacteria mostly related to skin infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp., and coagulase-negative staphylococci such as Staphylococcus epidermidis.7 Antibiotic resistance is a crucial problem in the management and treatment of infected wounds.8 Therefore, the interest in the search and development for alternative antimicrobial agents, including capped nanocomposites and platelet-rich plasma, acting also on resistant bacterial strains has recently been significantly increased.9–11 Antimicrobial properties of several polysaccharides from bacteria and fungi have been studied.Corning polystyrene clear flat-bottom 96-well microplates were used and the final volume per well was 0.1 mL.All procedures on mice conducted at KU Leuven were in accordance with the regulations of the European Union, Belgian and Flemish legislation, and approved by the local Ethics Committee (License number P270/2015, P128/2019, Belgium).After wound induction, single mice were housed in individual cages, to avoid confounding animal interactions, including biting and licking of wounds by other animals.n.d., non-detected.Leukocyte accumulation in skin wounds was analyzed at day 1 and day 3 post-injury and compared with intact skin.Whereas an increased early recruitment of monocytes/macrophages to the wound by treatment with COAM was observed, the associated differences in wound repair were modest.Furthermore, COAM has immunomodulatory effects in vivo, which are here extended to skin wound healing, and these effects deserve further exploration.

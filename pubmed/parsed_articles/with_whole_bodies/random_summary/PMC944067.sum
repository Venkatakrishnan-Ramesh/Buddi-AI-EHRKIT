Meanwhile, MGD treatment mainly begins from eyelid warming, eyelid massaging, and progresses to the uses of topical lubricants, topical and systemic antibiotics with anti-inflammatory properties, and topical steroids.In this study, DED symptoms were assessed as secondary endpoints using the Eye Dryness (ED) score, mean change from baseline in OSDI score, and mean change from baseline in Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) scores.The 5-unit scale for responses to the OSDI was given by the following: 0 = None of the time, 1 = Some of the time, 2 = Half of the time, 3 = Most of the time, and 4 = All of the time.In all randomized subjects, both TearCare and LipiFlow procedures demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared to baseline in MGD-related symptoms of DED as measured by OSDI 1-month post-procedure (p < 0.0001).The mean reduction from baseline in SANDE frequency score was 51.9 ± 3.70 (95% CI = [44.5, 59.2]) for the TearCare group and 41.5 ± 3.45 (95% CI = [34.7, 48.3]) for the LipiFlow group with LS mean difference = 10.4 ± 5.13 and pANCOVA = 0.0455 (Figure 4).Consequently, DED improves as demonstrated by positive outcomes in DED symptom assessments presented here and also in DED sign assessments such as TFBUT, fluorescein staining, etc.Such questionnaires are highly encouraged as the US Federal Food and Drug Administration promoted the use of patient-reported outcomes to support clinical trials and product submissions.In subjects with more severe meibomian gland dysfunction, TearCare provided better improvements in overall symptom relief, vision-related functions, and DED symptom frequency expressed by total OSDI score, OSDI Section B score, and SANDE frequency score.

Strains were grown in M63 minimal medium supplemented with either glucose (Top) or galactose (Bottom).Δspf cells expressing CRP–HA-His6 or GalK–HA-His6 from the chromosome (GSO1061 and GSO1060, respectively) were transformed with pKK–SpfP-recodedN-FLAG and grown in LB until an OD600 of ∼0.5 was reached.We also did not detect differences in LB-grown cells in the levels of the AzuC–SPA small protein (SI Appendix, Fig.Given how extensively CRP has been studied, it is intriguing that SpfP was not detected previously, although it is worth noting that a repressive, low-molecular–weight catabolite modulator factor was described decades ago (33).

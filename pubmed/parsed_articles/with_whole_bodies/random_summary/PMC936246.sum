TTS remains very rare, and benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.Further research is required to establish the true incidence of TTS following Vaxzevria.Table 1Overall number of events (cumulative) of thrombosis with concurrent thrombocytopenia reported to the MHRA, cumulative number of fatal cases reported, and cumulative case fatality (%) at weekly intervals [6]DateCases reported (cumulative)Fatal events (cumulative)Cumulative case fatalityCase fatality(%)Lower95% CI (%)Upper95% CI (%)12 May 20212625119.4714.8524.7919 May3325817.4713.5421.9902 Jun3726617.7414.0022.0109 Jun3907118.2114.5022.4016 Juna3896817.4813.8421.6223 Jun3957017.7214.0821.8530 Jun3997117.7914.1721.9114 Jul4117117.2713.7421.2818 Aug4177217.2713.7621.2425 Aug4157217.3513.8221.3401 Sep4167217.3113.8021.3008 Sep4197217.1813.6921.1415 Sep4197217.1813.6921.1429 Sep4217217.1013.6321.0506 Oct4247216.9813.5320.9013 Oct4217217.1013.6321.0520 Oct4237217.0213.5620.9527 Oct4247216.9813.5320.9003 Nov4257317.1813.7121.1110 Nov4257317.1813.7121.1117 Nov4267317.1413.6821.0601 Dec4287417.2913.8321.2108 Dec4287417.2913.8321.2115 Dec4297517.4814.0121.4122 Dec4307517.4413.9721.3705 Jan 20224337617.5514.0921.4712 Jan4357617.4714.0221.3719 Jan4357717.7014.2321.6225 Jan4367817.8914.4121.8202 Feb4377817.8514.3721.7709 Feb4387918.0414.5521.9616 Feb4387918.0414.5521.9623 Feb4387918.0414.5521.9602 Mara4377817.8514.3721.7709 Mar4387918.0414.5521.9616 Mar4387918.0414.5521.9623 Mar4387918.0414.5521.9630 Mar4397918.0014.5121.9106 Apr4407917.9514.4821.8704 May4438118.2814.7922.2011 May4438118.2814.7922.2018 May4438118.2814.7922.2025 May4438118.2814.7922.20CI confidence interval, MHRA Medicines and Health products Regulatory AgencyaDue to the MHRA merging cases and further reviewing events reported during follow-up, the counts decreased for this week.Overall number of events (cumulative) of thrombosis with concurrent thrombocytopenia reported to the MHRA, cumulative number of fatal cases reported, and cumulative case fatality (%) at weekly intervals [6].The majority of events had been reported following the first or unknown dose (n = 392 of 443 reports, 88.49% [95% CI 85.14–91.31%]).In this study, ‘depletion of the susceptibles’ bias may have affected the results, as the majority of people who were at risk of the event experienced TTS on their first exposure to the vaccine.Therefore, it remains important to report on case fatality of TTS events observed in the UK population where there was wide use of the vaccine in the primary COVID-19 vaccination programme.It is also possible that results may be affected by causality assessment of the TTS events that have been reported; details on causality assessments made by the MHRA are not available.While it could be assumed that patients diagnosed in a British hospital under the care of a haematologist would receive treatment per the guidelines, it is possible that factors such as death before treatment initiation meant the patient did not receive treatment for TTS.

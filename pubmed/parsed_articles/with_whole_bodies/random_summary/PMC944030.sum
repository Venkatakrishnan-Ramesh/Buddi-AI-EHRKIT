This approval was based on the original findings of the KEYNOTE-024 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02142738), in which pembrolizumab monotherapy was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as compared with platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line therapy of stage IV NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS greater than or equal to 50% and no EGFR or ALK genomic alterations.1 In the most recent analysis, with 5 years of follow-up in KEYNOTE-024, median pembrolizumab treatment duration was 7.9 months, and the Kaplan-Meier median OS was 26.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.3–40.4), with 5-year OS rate of 31.9%, in the pembrolizumab arm.2.Their median age was 70 years, including 303 patients (69%) who were younger than 75 years and 138 (31%) who were 75 years or older.The median rwToT with pembrolizumab was 5.6 months (95% CI: 4.4–6.7) overall (Table 2) and 5.7 and 5.6 months for those younger than 75 years and 75 years or older, respectively (Fig.We identified 441 patients with highly PD-L1–expressing advanced NSCLC, with no known EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or BRAF genomic alterations, who initiated first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy soon after this regimen became available in Japan.For example, the Kaplan-Meier 12-month OS rate for patients in this study was 72.2% overall and the 12-month OS rates for corresponding patient populations (with PD-L1 TPS ≥ 50%) in the pembrolizumab arms of clinical trials were 70.3%, 63.5%, and 67.9% in KEYNOTE-024, KEYNOTE-042, and KEYNOTE-598, respectively.21, 22, 23 The median OS estimate in this study was NR, whereas, with similar follow-up times, the median OS estimates from KEYNOTE-042 and KEYNOTE-598 were 20.0 months (95% CI: 15.9–24.2) and 21.9 months (95% CI: 18.0–NR), respectively.20,23 Moreover, we note that, in a recently published, prespecified subanalysis of KEYNOTE-024, the reported results for the 40 Japanese patients were consistent with those in the main study.24.The authors note that the incidence of AEs of special interest was similar between patients younger than 75 years and those 75 years or older.33.Finally, although study centers were geographically dispersed throughout Japan, our findings may not represent the entire patient population or treatment practices in Japan.In conclusion, the results of this noninterventional study complement KEYNOTE clinical trial findings and provide real-world evidence supporting the benefits of first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for treating advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS greater than or equal to 50% and no actionable genomic alterations, including for patients who are 75 years and older.

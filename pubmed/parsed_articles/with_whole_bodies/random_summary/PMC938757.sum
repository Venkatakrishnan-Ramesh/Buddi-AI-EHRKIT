Critical illness is known to cause a hypercoagulable state due to mechanical ventilation, immobilization, central venous access devices, and nutritional deficiencies.ACE2 is expressed especially in vascular endothelial cells, but also in the heart, kidney, nasal and pulmonary cells.Reduced fibrinolysis has been described in severe COVID-19 and increased thromboembolic events occur in patients with severe abnormalities of clot dissolution [34,36].In severe COVID-19 infections, hypofibrinolysis has been well documented and has been linked to hypercoagulability, increased morbidity and mortality [7,37].As the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 prevents the degradation of Ang II, the excess of Ang II further increases the level of PAI-1 [38,39].All of the mechanisms described above lead to the inhibition of fibrinolysis, causing a hypercoagulable state.Thrombolytic therapy is recommended only for acute patients with confirmed PE who show clinical deterioration [21].Patients who take low-dose aspirin should continue the therapy.Some studies suggested to stop DOAC and shift to heparins due to the DOACsâ€™ interaction with antivirals or immunosuppressive therapy [21].Thus, antiviral drugs interact with DOACs and may cause significantly increase their blood levels, thus enhancing the risk of bleeding [48].

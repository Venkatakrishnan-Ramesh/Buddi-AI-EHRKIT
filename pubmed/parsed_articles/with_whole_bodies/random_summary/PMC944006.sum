However, they leave this feeding ground in spring and cross the Pacific Ocean to arrive in Alaska, an ecological niche in the Northern hemisphere that better supports their breeding [3].However, despite more than 100 years of research within this field, the molecular mechanisms that protect mammals from excessive weight gain are still largely unknown.Moreover, food is typically infused in liquid form into the stomach continuously throughout the day, as opposed to ingestion of solid food during distinct feeding episodes (meals) in ad libitum-fed animals.Schematic diagram showing the hypothesized potential tissue sources of circulating factors of overfeeding.It is envisioned that overfeeding-induced satiety factors circulate at elevated levels during the entire hypophagic phase [41].However, two overfeeding studies in male Long Evans rats have shown that ghrelin levels quickly increase after overfeeding and return to baseline levels before food intake normalizes [[25], [68]], indicating that a decrease in ghrelin levels is not the primary mediator of post-overfeeding hypophagia.However, injection of recombinant leptin at a dose equivalent to that present within the conditioned medium from db/db mice had no effect on food intake in ob/ob mice [87].Adipose tissue is a highly dynamic organ that undergoes expansion and remodeling in response to energy deprivation or excess.These notions are supported by evidence from studies on several different rodent species.However, although experimental overfeeding studies in animals have an obvious potential to unravel new regulatory pathways underlying body weight homeostasis, the approach remains underutilized.Finally, experimental overfeeding holds promise as a complementary model to experimentally interrogate how total energy intake versus dietary macronutrient composition versus meal timing affects energy balance, body weight and metabolic homeostasis [147,148,161] (Figure 7).Figure 7Features and utility of experimental overfeeding in animals.

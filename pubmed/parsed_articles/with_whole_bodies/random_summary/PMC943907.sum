We aimed to assess the parameter of dual-energy spectral CT (DesCT) consistency with BMD determination using quantitative computed tomography (QCT), thereby establishing a basis for further DesCT application for BMD determination.We subjected the European spine phantom, which contains three vertebral bodies (V1, V2, and V3), to DesCT with different radiation doses.Some studies14,21,25 have reported the application of dual-energy computed tomography for the BMD measurement; however, the conclusions were different and the complex calculation process related to BMD of the dual-energy CT limits its clinical application.Continuous inpatient electronic medical records at the Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, were reviewed for patients who underwent QCT and DesCT for chest scans between February 1, 2021, and March 31, 2022; the interval between the two examinations was no more than two months.(B) Positioning of the sagittal and axial views for subsequent automatic placement of region of interest (ROIs).P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.All patients underwent QCT and DesCT for chest scans.Among the 242 vertebrae (152 T12 and 90 L1 vertebrae), there was no significant difference between the BMD measured by QCT and the HAP (average) measured by DesCT (p = 0.071).This study first measured and analysed the ESP, which comprised epoxy resin and HAP.The interclass correlation coefficient of the two measurements was significant, consistent with the results obtained by Mei et al,25 indicating that cancellous BMD determined by the rapid kV-switching energy spectrum material separation method can be used for BMD evaluation.Therefore, the measurement and analysis results of human T12 and L1 vertebrae still need further confirmation with other human vertebra specimens or in vivo studies.

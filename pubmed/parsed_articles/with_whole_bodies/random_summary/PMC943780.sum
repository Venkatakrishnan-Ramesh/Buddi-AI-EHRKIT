The coupling model was used to analyze the effect of supplementation and optimize mining, to ensure that spring water continues to flow during the dry season while supplying the mining demand.Karst simulation models cover a wide range of application areas and can be used for “global” analysis.The strata exhibit a northward dip and form a monoclinic structure.Overview map of the study area.In the early 1960s, the amount of groundwater exploited in urban Jinan areas was less than 11.57 m3/s, the average spring water level was 30.72–31.54 m, and the spring flow rate was 3.89–4.11 m3/s.Subsequently, the CFP program was re-run to obtain the corresponding spring water level simulation value, and then calculated the RMSE (after adjusting the parameter value).According to the Reynolds number (calculated based on the diameter and flow velocity), the water flow in the conduit was determined to be laminar flow.Jinan is world-famous for its springs.There are more than 800 springs in the city of Jinan and 136 well-known springs within 2.6 km2 of the urban city area (Zhang et al., 2003).This study identified a karst conduit at the elevation of 15.93m in S1 Well—the elevation of −25.71m in S4 Well—the elevation of −37.34m in S10 Well—the elevation of −39.84m in Baotu Spring.

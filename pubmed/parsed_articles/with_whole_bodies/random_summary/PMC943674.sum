Developmental deficits range from specific limitations of learning, defects of executive functions to impairments of social abilities or intelligence (Association, 2013).These energy requirements are frequently summarized by the common assertion that “the adult brain accounts for 2% of body weight, yet it is estimated to be responsible for 20% of oxygen consumption and 20%–25% of glucose utilization” (Figure 1A) (Sokoloff, 1999).Such statements include the calculation that a gram of the human brain consumes as much ATP and oxygen as a gram of muscle during a marathon (Figure 1A2) (Attwell and Laughlin, 2001).Sun energy rate density figure can be obtained from the following astrophysical constants: solar luminosity-energy output = 384.6 septillion watts (3.846E+26 W or 3.846E+33 ergs per second) and a solar mass of 1.989E+33 g (Groom, 2000).p value was calculated with a hypergeometric test.Note that 100% of the gene defects are autosomal recessive with high prevalence of neurodevelopmental phenotypes such as intellectual disability and microcephaly.(A2) represents the equivalence between the amount of energy consumed by the brain and a muscle during a marathon proposed by Atwell (Attwell and Laughlin, 2001).Transition from neuroprogenitor cells to mature neurons reprograms metabolism from being preponderantly glycolytic to one dominated by mitochondrial respiration (Beckervordersandforth, 2017; Iwata and Vanderhaeghen, 2021; Zheng et al., 2016).Importantly, this metabolic transition is necessary for neurogenesis (Almeida and Vieira, 2017; Beckervordersandforth et al., 2017; Iwata and Vanderhaeghen, 2021).

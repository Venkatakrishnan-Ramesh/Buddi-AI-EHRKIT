Although advances have been made in imaging techniques of the anterior segment, such as anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), the appropriate analysis of acquired high-resolution images has been limited by the lack of proper analytical tools.All procedures conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki, and this study was approved by the institutional review board of the Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan, Seoul, Korea.The η6 seems to be mainly related to the corneal thickness, whereas ηA appears to represent the asymmetricity as intended (Fig.Among the latent variables, PACG eyes have a smaller value of η4 compared to PAC eyes (P = 0.015; Table).To enhance the difference, we upscaled the mean values of the latent variables for each group by a factor of three.The angle difference was more noticeable with the narrower angle in the PACG group compared to that of the PAC group (middle row of Fig.4), although there was little difference for the cornea or lens.However, some latent variables (η4, η5) are difficult to interpret, which implies complex interactions between AS-OCT features but also leaves room for further improvement of the model.Hence, we expect the generalizability of our analysis to be limited, and the results should be assumed to be dependent on a specific dataset we have used.

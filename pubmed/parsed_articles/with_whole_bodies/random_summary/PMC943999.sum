All patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for GBS, were unable to walk independently at study entry, and received the same IVIg regimen of 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 consecutive days.To define the pharmacokinetics of IVIg before the first 2-week follow-up visit, and to obtain more robust predictions, we included previous results on serum IgG levels from 15 patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).All samples in the model-building cohort and the validation cohort were tested for IgG on the same platform in 2009 and between 2018 and 2019, respectively.The CL was considerably higher in patients with a more severe form of disease as reflected by a higher GBS-DS (Fig.Bootstrap analysis (convergence 88%) underlined the stability of the model and denoted acceptable lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval (Table 2).C Absolute individual weighted residuals (IWRES) against time.However, the variance was significantly different from 1 (p < 0.001).The other sub-charts show simulations with alternative conditions as follows: B the impact of disease severity (Guillain–Barré syndrome disability score [GBS-DS]); C additional treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) [500 mg for 5 days]; and D 3 versus 6-day regimen of 0.4 g/kg/day, and 2.0 g/kg in 2 days.Corticosteroids were previously found to reduce the expression of the IgG recycling FcRn, which may partly explain the lower total serum IgG level after IVIg treatment [40, 41].Here, a baseline variable was used, estimated from individual pre-IVIg IgG levels; a method successfully utilised before, regarding similar endogenous production issues [46].Although this disease is clinically similar to GBS, these particular patients were not treatment naïve.Moreover, we evaluated the robustness of the model and the parameter estimates in an independent validation cohort.

Among these fungi, the genus Gibellula is highly regarded as a specialised spider-killer that has never been reported to infect other arthropods.For instance, G. cebrennini can be discriminated from G. fusiformispora only by having much longer conidiophores (Kuephadungphan et al.4D).attached to the underside of a dicot leaf, 9 Mar.5D–E).7E–F).2011, Chiriví-Salomón et al.8B–C).8G).Conidia narrowly almond-shaped, 3–4 × 1.5–2 μm (Fig.Synnemata composed of loose hyphae, white, becoming yellowish white toward base, cylindrical, tapered toward the apex, curved (Fig.Phialides broad cylindrical to clavate, 5–6.5(–8) × 2–3 μm.Herein, we report G. unica from Thailand for the first time since the species was described (Tzean et al.As the exoskeleton structure is different between insects and spiders (Evans 2013, Machałowski 2020), a focus on pathogenic fungi parasitising Myrmarachne spiders and the ant species mimicked by the spider would provide insight on whether the exoskeleton is the main factor driving the evolution of Gibellula.Akad.1977.

There were 41 patients with transcervical incision, 4 with cervical incision+sternotomy, 2 with cervical incision and thoracoscopic surgery, and 1 with cervical incision and surgery via the subxiphoid approach.Based on the range of involvement, it can be divided into limited type and diffuse type.Although cervical goiters are easily recognized, the initial presentation of mainly substernal goiters may be unusual [3].Careful preoperative testing, thoughtful consideration of the type of anesthesia (intravenous induction of muscle relaxant using laryngoscopy or Glidescope), and planning the extent of surgery and postoperative care are necessary to achieve optimal results [4,8].Next, blunt dissection was performed with fingers along the mass envelope, and the tumor was gradually dragged to the neck.With comprehensive preoperative examination, planning and multidisciplinary evaluation, as well as intraoperative delicate operation, most RG can be safely resected through a “collar-like” cervical incision (Figure 3A).If great vessels such as the innominate veins need to be replaced, the whole course of the vessels to be replaced should be exposed horizontally.Complications of median sternotomy include sternal osteomyelitis, foreign-body infection, sternal dehiscence, arrhythmias and sternal instability.In addition, median sternotomy can also lead to internal mammary vessel injury and brachial plexus traction injury, resulting in prolonged postoperative pain.Dynamic tracheal collapse under bronchoscopy is the criterion standard in the diagnosis of tracheomalacia.Despite its low sensitivity, the tracheomalacia test has high specificity and is an effective adjunctive to bronchoscopy [25].

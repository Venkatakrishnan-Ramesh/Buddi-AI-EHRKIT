Protein levels of NCAPG in LUAD were validated by immuno-histochemistry.Elucidation of its regulatory network, especially at the lncRNA levels, will be beneficial for understanding cancer pathogenesis and for informing the development of appropriate prevention and treatment strategies.Patients who had received radiotherapy and chemotherapy, or had other malignant tumors, coronary heart disease, or diabetes were excluded.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on samples from LUAD patients as previously described.42 Briefly, after deparaffinization, hydration and antigen retrieval, tissue sections were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with anti-NCAPG primary antibodies (Rabbit Anti-NCAPG antibody ab251864, 1:100; Abcam Corp., Cambridge, UK).Based on analyses of the TCGA-LUSC dataset, NCAPG mRNA levels were significantly correlated with N stage (Figure S1A), but not with TNM stage, T stage and distant metastasis in LUSC patients (Figure S1B, C, D).**P <0.01; ***P <0.001.LUAD patients in TCGA-LUAD (Figure 4A), GEO31210 (Figure 4B and C), GSE30219 (Figure 4D) and GSE72094 (Figure 4E-G) datasets with elevated NCAPG levels had markedly worse OS outcomes, especially early-stage LUAD patients.(H-J) K-M curve indicating the OS of LUAD patients in GSE72094 cohort.(C) The association of AC099850.3 expression with TNM stage and N stage in TCGA-LUAD patients.Moreover, higher expression levels of NCAPG were associated with EGFR-TKIs resistance in 57 LUAD patients undergoing TKIs treatment.

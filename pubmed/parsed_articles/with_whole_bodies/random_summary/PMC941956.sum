pShuttle-YF17D/Core-URA3 and pShuttle-YF17D/ENS1-URA3) replacing URA3 markers (derived from pAG61, EUROSCARF plasmid P30112) in their respective Core and E/NS1 gene regions; yielding each a subgenomic (5’ and 3’ part) cDNA clone in a pShuttle backbone.23,25 (iii) The resulting intermediary vectors (pD and pEF) were finally assembled with ABC in yeast to obtain non-functional, non-infectious but complete pABCDEF, i.e.a pShuttle-Asibi clone with the hygromycin resistance gene (safety lock) inserted in the XhoI site of the virus cDNA.The thus obtained plasmid material was transfected into sub-confluent BHK-21J cells for virus rescue.Titers of YFV-specific nAbs (c) and spike-specific nAbs (d) (n= 8 from two independent experiments) at day 21 post-vaccination.Data shown are median ± IQR.Cellular responses were assessed by ELISpot.In addition, these hamsters also showed no systemic MX2 expression anymore (Figure 2m; S2e), an IFN-stimulated gene triggered by virus infection.18,30 Collectively, these results indicate that single-dose YF-S0 vaccination provides full protection against YFV challenge and virus-induced viscerotropic disease in hamsters, comparable to original YF17D.The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of SNT assay to determine YFV- and spike-specific nAbs titer was 2.2 Log10 (≥1:150) and 1 Log10 (≥1:10), respectively; whereas the lower limit of detection (LLOD) of IIFA assay to determine the spike-specific bAbs titer was 1.1 Log10 (≥1:12.5).In summary, these results suggest that strong pre-existing YFV immunity has no major impact on protection against stringent SARS-CoV-2 infection challenge conferred by either single- or two-dose YF-S0 vaccination.provided advice on data interpretation and critical edits to the text; J.M, H.J.T.

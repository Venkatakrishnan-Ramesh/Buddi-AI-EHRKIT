Next, to examine the possibility that maternal exposures induce a systemic immune response in the dams, we analyzed a curated panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines linked to adverse outcomes in offspring.To probe whether the acoustic structure of USVs was altered we used a machine-learning tool, Mouse Ultrasonic Profile ExTraction (MUPET), to identify distinct repertoire/syllable units (Figure 2C) (Van Segbroeck et al., 2017).Specifically, in CON males and females and DEP + MS females, higher social preference directly correlated with increased activation of the EN-social network in response to social encounters (Figures 3G and S4C); however, this correlation was abolished in DEP + MS male mice.Males and females were tested using separate testing boxes on different days.This was done in MATLAB using the function mscohere with default settings, also at a resolution of 1 Hz.This model is fully described elsewhere (Talbot et al., 2020), and the code to implement these models is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6078304.Frozen samples were homogenized in 1000 Î¼L TRIzol Reagent (15596026, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and vortexed at 2000 rpm for 5 min.

We obtained the full texts of potentially eligible studies to assess eligibility and extracted data using standardized forms.For other outcomes, this shortened one‐week AmBd and 5FC regimen had similar fungal clearance (MD 0.05 log10 CFU/mL/day, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.12; 186 participants, 1 study) as well as lower risk of grade three or four anaemia (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.60; 228 participants, 1 study) compared to the two‐week regimen of AmBd and 5FC.For 10‐week mortality, the comparison of two weeks of 5FC and FLU with two weeks of AmBd and 5FC (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.23; 340 participants, 1 study) or two weeks of AmBd and FLU (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.13; 339 participants, 1 study) did not show a difference in mortality, with moderate‐certainty evidence for both comparisons.When two weeks of combination AmBd and 5FC was compared with AmBd alone, pooled data showed lower mortality at 10 weeks (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.95; 231 participants, 2 studies, moderate‐certainty evidence).When two weeks of AmBd and FLU was compared to AmBd alone, there was no difference in 10‐week mortality in pooled data (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.62; 371 participants, 3 studies, low‐certainty evidence).One week of AmBd and 5FC followed by FLU on days 8 to 14 was the best induction therapy regimen after comparison with 11 other regimens for 10‐week mortality in the network meta‐analysis, with an overall SUCRA ranking of 88%.In resource‐limited settings, one‐week AmBd‐ and 5FC‐based therapy is probably superior to other regimens for treatment of HIV‐associated cryptococcal meningitis.Some participants received a lower dose of fluconazole than is currently recommended in combination with AmBd..1Downgraded two levels for imprecision.Most cases occur in the context of advanced HIV disease (defined as cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell count < 200 cells/mm3), with the risk increasing with decreasing CD4 cell count.This reflects, in part, an enduring high proportion of HIV‐positive individuals who present late for care due to delays in HIV diagnosis and linkage to care (Anderegg 2017).In 2014, an estimated 223,100 incident cases and 181,100 deaths occurred globally, and cryptococcal meningitis is estimated to cause up to 15% of HIV‐related deaths (Rajasingham 2017).A typically asymptomatic primary pulmonary infection occurs after inhalation of fungal spores or desiccated yeast.The accumulation of yeast or shed capsular polysaccharides may obstruct CSF reabsorption at arachnoid granulations, leading to elevated intracranial pressure (Loyse 2010).HIV‐associated cryptococcal meningitis is a significant cause of mortality in HIV‐positive individuals, particularly people with advanced HIV disease in resource‐limited settings, and results in up to 15% of HIV‐related deaths (Rajasingham 2017).However, the review combined data from RCTs with cohort and other non‐randomized trials, and included re‐treatment cases.We did not limit study inclusion by duration of induction therapy or by drug dosage.Our primary treatment outcome was mortality.Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI);all conferences of the International AIDS Society (IAS);International Conference on Cryptococcus and Cryptococcosis (ICCC);Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) IDWeek.For continuous outcomes (for example, rate of fungal clearance), we calculated pairwise mean differences (MDs) with 95% CI.For binary outcomes, we performed intention‐to‐treat analyses.We planned to assess reporting bias across the network using comparison‐adjusted funnel plots (Chaimani 2013).We excluded studies with > 20% missing mortality outcome data within six months.Downgraded by two levels.In all but one study (Mayanja‐Kizza 1998), patients were scheduled to receive at least one additional LP after diagnostic LP during induction, an intervention that reduces intracranial pressure and may improve survival (Bicanic 2009;Meda 2014;Rolfes 2014).Overall, 712 HIV‐positive adults with first episode of cryptococcal meningitis were randomized 2:1:1:1:1 to (i) two weeks of 5FC 100 mg/kg/day and FLU 1200 mg/day, (ii) two weeks of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and FLU 1200 mg/day, (iii) two weeks of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and 5FC 100 mg/kg/day, (iv) one week of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and FLU 1200 mg/day followed on days 8 to 14 by FLU 1200 mg/day, or (v) one week of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and 5FC 100 mg/kg/day followed by FLU 1200 mg/day on days 8 to 14.No direct comparisons were made to findings from high‐income settings, where mortality with two weeks of AmBd‐based induction regimens is observed to be lower (Saag 1991; van der Horst 1997).The study from Thailand used a low dose of FLU (400 mg/day) combined with AmBd, and the study from the USA and Thailand had one intervention with a low dose (400 mg/day) and one with a higher dose (800 mg/day) of FLU with AmBd.One large study, a double‐blinded RCT from Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Laos, Uganda, and Malawi, randomized 451 participants 1:1 to receive two weeks of AmBd and FLU with adjunctive dexamethasone or two weeks of AmBd and FLU only (Beardsley 2016).One recently completed trial in Botswana and Tanzania randomized participants to two weeks of L‐AmB 3 mg/kg/day or one of three short courses of high‐dose L‐AmB, a single dose of L‐AmB 10 mg/kg on day one, L‐AmB 10 mg/kg on day one and 5 mg/kg on day three, or L‐AmB 10 mg/kg on day one and 5 mg/kg on days three and seven (Jarvis 2018).Mortality up to 10 weeks and at six months was low in both arms, with no significant difference between groups (28 participants, 1 study, Analysis 15.1, Table 15: subgroups 2 and 3; very low‐certainty evidence).No difference was observed in mean EFA between the AmBd and 5FC and FLU group and either the AmBd with FLU (26 participants, 1 study, Analysis 18.2) or AmBd alone group (29 participants, 1 study, Analysis 19.2).The Brouwer 2004 study did not report DAIDS grade three or four events.The size of the node is proportional to the number of participants randomized to the treatment combination, and the width of the edge is proportional to the number of trials comparing the treatment combinations.The top three ranked treatment combinations (with SUCRA values) at 10 weeks were one week of AmBd and 5FC (88%), two weeks of AmBd and 5FC and FLU (74%), and two weeks of 5FC and FLU (67%), while the bottom three ranked treatment combinations were one week of AmBd and two weeks of FLU (26%), two weeks of AmBd and FLU and steroids (26%), and two weeks of AmBd (19%) (Figure 13).The larger the SUCRA value, the higher the ranking probability for the treatment combination in the network.We found no evidence of inconsistency for any outcome using the design‐by‐treatment interaction modelling, node‐splitting, and loop‐specific approaches.We further limited bias during the review process by conducting an extensive search using a wide range of search terms and databases.There is a need to expand access to 5FC in resource‐limited settings where HIV‐associated cryptococcal meningitis is most common.

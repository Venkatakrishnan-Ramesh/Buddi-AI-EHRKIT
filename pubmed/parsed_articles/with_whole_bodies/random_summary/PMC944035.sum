Hemorrhagic strokes (HS) carry a higher risk of mortality compared to ischemic strokes [11].The patient's labs showed leukocytosis (WBCs 42,000/mm3), pH of 6.7, HCO3 of 3 mEq/L, K of 5 mEq/L and elevated lactic acid (3.4 mmol/L) which was consistent with DKA.Hemorrhagic stroke includes intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage in most of cases [4,5].Most HS in children in general are intraparenchymal and supratentorial.ICP is 1.5-6 mmHg in infants, 3-7 mmHg in young children and 10-15 mmHg in older children and adults.

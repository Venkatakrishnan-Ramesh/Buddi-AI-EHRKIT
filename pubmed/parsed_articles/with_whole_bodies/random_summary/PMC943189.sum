11–13 It is because the number of molecules contributing photons to the detector is unknown that we propose a nonparametric Bayesian framework.10,22,23 In doing so, we extend our previous work on single-spot detector with single photon arrival times as its output.13 In doing so, we achieve multi-particle tracking with spatial resolution below the width of a single confocal spot.To be able to evaluate the precision of our method, we compared the targeted posteriors of the molecular trajectories with ground truth trajectories.Put differently, less information or fewer photons implies less trajectory certainty and thus broader posteriors.3 we demonstrate the robustness of our method as we generate synthetic data with an increasing number of molecules in the ROI.This is because the same number of photons is now needed to learn twice as many trajectories as we had earlier.5(c) with respect to the point of origin (in units of μm).Except the case that the confocal volumes overlap substantially, these distances are within the realm of what can be achieved in current experimental setups.15,16,27–30.This allows us to have localization precision as great as ten times that of single-focus confocal volume width (see Figs.Retaining molecular identity is an advantage in resolving single molecule events unique to individual molecules with high localization precision.Second, if photobleaching is avoided, they can track molecules over large distances.Respectively, these are:.Here, for all the synthetic observation traces, we consider all confocal volumes as 3D Gaussians, but as we explain in the SI Sec.S.4.1., NSampling the diffusion coefficient DJoint sampling the molecular brightnesses μmmol and background photon emission rates μmback for m = 1, .

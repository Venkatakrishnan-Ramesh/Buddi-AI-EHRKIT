The targeting ability of IPP-c was validated in in vitro experiments on selectively killing the CXCR4-overexpressing HCC cells.Recently, near-infrared (NIR) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) have been developed for early tumor detection and diagnosis.9–12 Because PAI offers high imaging resolution in deep tissue and FLI provides high imaging sensitivity, the combination of the two modalities can accurately detect exogenous and endogenous contrasts including oxygen saturation, lipids, hemoglobin concentration, and a variety of molecules and nanoparticles.13–17 Meanwhile, due to the high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) and efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation of some optical contrast agents, the combination of photothermal therapy (PTT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be readily co-implemented under the real-time guidance by optical imaging, which provides an excellent adjuvant strategy to efficient ablation and hypoxia amelioration for tumor treatment.18–22.The anti-CXCR4 (ab208128) was bought from Abcam (Shanghai, China).The morphology was captured using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Philips Tecnai 12, 120 kV, Netherland).Meanwhile, the PA stability for IPP-c NPs was tested using the PACT system after laser irradiation for 0s to 1500s.Fluorescent signal of IPP-c NPs was tested and quantified using an in vivo Xtreme live animal imaging system.The aqueous solutions of IPP-c NPs with different concentrations (from 0 to 0.4 mg mL−1) were filled into quartz colorimetric dishes.The label-free OR-PAM system was used to image the normal liver region and the tumor region (wavelength 532 nm, laser energy 75 nJ).(D) Cell viability of HepG2 and LM3 cells after incubation with IPP-c NPs of different concentrations with laser irradiation for 8 minutes (808 nm, 0.8W·cm−2).The PA signal in the IPP-c group was strong in orthotopic tumors, which was significantly stronger than the ICG group (P<0.01), indicating that the IPP-c NPs targeted aggregation in SHCCs of mice.(A) Infrared thermal imaging of orthotopic tumor-bearing mice treated respectively with IPP-c and PBS upon 808-nm laser irradiation (0.8W·cm−2) for different durations.The targeted nano-agent IPP-c has demonstrated good stability, biosafety, superior PAI/FLI ability, and reliable PTT/PDT performance, which encourages more opportunities for phototheranostics in vivo in multiple tumor models.

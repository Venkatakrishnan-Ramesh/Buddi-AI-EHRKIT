Measurement of preoperative PTS is critical for determining the dimensions of the anterior bone wedge that will be removed.3 We calculate PTS on lateral radiographs using the following established method.7 Two circles are drawn in the tibial shaft, which lie tangent to the anterior to posterior cortices.Gentle elevation of the patella tendon from its attachment on the proximal portion of the tibial tubercle aids with visualization.Fluoroscopy is used to ensure satisfactory pin placement in the coronal and sagittal planes.It is crucial to clean this area of the knee after removal of bone, so the osteotomy closes nicely when the knee is gently extended.aims for a postoperative slope between 3° and 5°, Sonnery-Cottet et al.We believe the technique described here is safe and reproducible, while avoiding a biplanar or tibial tubercle osteotomy.

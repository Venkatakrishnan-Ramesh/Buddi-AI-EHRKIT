His interleukin-6 level in the acute phase of the disease was 100.41 and at the resolution it was 46.2 pg/ml.Thorax auscultation showed whistles and buzzes.Interleukin-6 levels during all the phases of the disease were <6.25 pg/ml.The nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, diagnosed by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction - RT-PCR diagnostic on 2 molecular targets (E, N2) (Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, Cepheid, Maurens-Scopont, France), was positive in 2 different swabs and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.Increased IL-6 levels are reported in other viral respiratory tract infections in children, and increased IL-6 levels are associated with increased mortality in children younger than 5 years of age with severe pneumonia [6].More COVID-19 pediatric cases tend to have normal IL-6, making it different compared to adults [4].Case 1 showed moderately increased CRP during hospitalization, but high levels of IL6, despite more severe pneumonia requiring oxygen treatment for a longer time.These findings are similar to those of other studies reporting normal or mildly increased CRP levels in patients with severe COVID-19 disease [8].An increase of neutrophils was associated with IL-6 levels, while leucocytosis and other parameters were associated with the severity of COVID-19 [10].Zhu et al studied the relationship between COVID-19 outcome and inflammatory parameters, showing the correlation between IL-6 levels and CRP, NLR, IL-10, and IFN-Î³ levels.Nevertheless, children with severe COVID-19 have increased cytokines secretion in the acute phase of the disease, while MIS-C patients and Kawasaki disease patients have a cytokines storm as a late response to the infection.

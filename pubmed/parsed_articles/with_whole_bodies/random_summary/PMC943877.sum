Following the mock OSPEs, an online survey was sent to the participants to assess their satisfaction, quality and benefits of the mock OSPE.The study also evaluated the impact of the mock OSPE on students’ performance.Out of 313 first-year students, 279 (89.1%) attended the mock OSPE and out of 298 second-year students, 213 (71.5%) attended.It was adapted from the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).1,2 In the college of medicine, King Saud University (KSU), the OSPE is system oriented and integrated from basic sciences departments, so that the questions are from anatomy, physiology, and pathology departments.The courses are integrated between the basic sciences departments, system oriented with problem- based learning (PBL) components and early clinical practice.As the teaching methods vary, there are variety of examination methods including written exams, OSCEs, OSPEs and PBL sessions evaluation.More than half of the students (first-year students n=150, 78%, second-year students n=68, 67%) felt that attending the mock OSPE helped in easing the steps, better preparation (first-year students n=148, 77%, second-year students n=621, 61%), provided sufficient orientation (first-year students n=151, 79%, second-year students n=67, 66%), well explained the materials (first-year students n=142, 74%, second year students n=64, 63%) and helped them to learn the concept of the final OSPE (first-year students n=145, 76%, second-year students n=74, 63%).Table 4 showed that there was no significant difference between attending and non-attending the mock OSPE in the students’ performance in the summative OSPE.Increased satisfaction and involvement of the student and faculty in the OSPE, allowed this type of testing to become an integral component of the evaluation system of the preclinical years blocks.12.Further studies are needed in this field.The peer-led mock OSPE assessed mock OSPE improved the medical students’ confidence and lowered the anxiety associated with OSPE.

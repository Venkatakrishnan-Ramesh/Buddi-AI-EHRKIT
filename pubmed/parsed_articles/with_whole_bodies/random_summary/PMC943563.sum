In contrast, pulsed field ablation (PFA) is a novel ablation modality that, in pre-clinical and clinical studies, has displayed preferential tissue ablation.This included the absence of: (i) oesophageal damage as evaluated by oesophagoduodenoscopy and thoracic MRI, (ii) phrenic nerve injury, or iii) PV stenosis/narrowing.As shown in Table 1, most clinical sites classified themselves as academic (70.8%), 20.8% were private and 8.3% were semi-academic.The mean number of operators/centre was 3.8 (range 2–11), with an average of 13.2 years in practice (range 5.3–22.5).The cohort included 1758 patients who underwent PFA between March 2021 and January 2022.The first was a patient presenting with coronary artery spasm during PFA along the posterior mitral isthmus region, resolving after the administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin; the details of this major complication have been published as a case report.18 Second, a 78-year-old multimorbid patient with known heart failure presented with intra-procedural haemoptysis requiring bronchoscopy and suction; the remaining course until hospital discharge was uneventful.Even in the hands of multiple operators, the vast majority of whom was using the pentaspline PFA catheter for the first time, there was a high acute success rate for PVI (99.9%).Of course, because systematic PV imaging was not performed during follow-up, we cannot rule out the possibility of asymptomatic PV stenosis.First, virtually all of the 90 operators included in the MANIFEST-PF survey had never used this PFA catheter beforehand, so the entire learning curve was captured within this survey—though it should be noted that these physicians were from expert centres commencing PFA.The clinical significance of asymptomatic brain lesions remains unclear as there were no neurological abnormalities reported.

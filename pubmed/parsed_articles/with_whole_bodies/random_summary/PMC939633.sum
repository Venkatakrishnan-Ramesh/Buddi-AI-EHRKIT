The NHANES database has been frequently used for the study of fatty liver disease.22–24 Currently, NHANES 2017-2018 is the only public database with FibroScan® liver fibrosis assessment, laboratory, and examination data.All patients provided written informed consent for the use of their data in research studies, such as this one.MAFLD was diagnosed based on the updated international expert consensus statement on MAFLD from 2020.21 In the NHANES cohort, hepatic steatosis was measured by FibroScan®, with a criterion of CAP ≥248 dB/m.25 Advanced fibrosis was defined as fibrosis grade ≥F3 (LSM ≥8.2 kPa).26 Participants with a fasting time <3 h, <10 complete LSMs, or LSM interquartile range/median LSM ≥30% were considered as unsuccessful measurements and excluded.After excluding 3,776 cases with missing data and 405 cases with ineligible FibroScan® data, a total of 5,073 participants were eligible for final analysis (Fig.NFS had the largest AUROC (0.679; 95% CI: 0.648–0.709), followed by APRI (0.616; 95% CI: 0.583–0.650), FIB-4 (0.601; 95% CI: 0.569–0.63371), and BARD (0.589; 95% CI: 0.556–0.621).The predictive capabilities of NFS and FIB-4 were not significantly different in the Asian cohort which had high liver enzymes (0.699 vs. 0.683, p=0.519).Overall, the performances of the four noninvasive scoring systems in MAFLD are not as good as previously reported for NAFLD.The APRI and BARD scores are simple to calculate and easy to acquire in clinical practice.The poor performance of BARD might be caused by the partial duplication of the BARD scoring variables and the MAFLD diagnostic variables.Moreover, different from the population-based survey of the NHANES cohort, the increased liver enzyme was the main reason precipitating consultation in the biopsy-proven Asian cohort.In conclusion, NFS is better for predicting advanced fibrosis in MAFLD.

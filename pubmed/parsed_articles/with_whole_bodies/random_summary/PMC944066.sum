Toxicity symptoms resulting from IR formulation ingestion are expected within 3 hours of ingestion, while ER formulation ingestions may take up to 16 hours.10.If the patient did not experience cardiac arrest and access to the central line has not been established, calcium gluconate can be utilized as an alternative.Serum electrolytes should be monitored hourly for hyponatremia (after a high dose of dextrose is given), hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia.Despite the evidence supporting HIET utility in CCB toxicity in adults, less is known regarding HIET utility in CCB toxicity in pediatric patients.28 Positive results from several case reports have been published.7,56 For cases where HIET was not effective, treatment failure has been attributed to late administration of HIET, multi-drug toxicity, inadequate dosing, and lack of consistent dosing and duration in the pediatric population.Epinephrine increases HR, contractility, and BP through stimulation of β1 and α1 adrenergic receptors simultaneously.

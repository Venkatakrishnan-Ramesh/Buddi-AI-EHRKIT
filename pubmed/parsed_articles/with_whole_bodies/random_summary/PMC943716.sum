A total of 46 eyes with POAG underwent CLASS or CLASS + Phaco were followed up for 1 year.The primary outcomes included changes in intraocular pressure (IOP), medication and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).The overall success rate was higher in the CLASS than CLASS + Phaco group at 1 year after surgery.However, lowering IOP is the most effective treatment [1, 5].However, due to the risk of potential complications, there has been a substantial decrease in Trab during the past 5 years in China [9].If IOP cannot be controlled under maximal medication, surgery should be initiated for these patients, and combination surgery seems to be the recommended method [14].Slit-lamp examination (A1–C1) and ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) examination (A2–C2) of patients without bleb in CLASS + Phaco group; slit-lamp examination (D1–F1) and UBM examination (D2–F2) of patients with functional bleb in CLASS group.Supplementary Table 1 showed the success rate at each time point in both groups after surgery.The definition of success in our study was modified based on previous studies [23] to distinguish the proportion of patients transformed from QS to CS after postoperative Nd:YAG laser intervention [17].A longer-term usage of multiple antiglaucoma medications might lead to a greater inflammatory reaction and higher scarring tendency [25].As we know, the TDM has a narrow and thin membrane near the iris root.

Angiography performed 3 months after surgery revealed good patency of the STA–MCA anastomosis (Fig.2).C: Anterior–posterior view of right external carotid angiography obtained 3 months after STA–MCA anastomosis.4B).4C).After completion of the anastomosis, indocyanine green video angiography revealed good patency of the bypass with left-to-right flow direction through the graft (Fig.SSS = superior sagittal sinus.have hypothesized that progressive occlusion of the ICA jeopardizes hemodynamics in other arteries, causing compensatory dilation and increased blood flow through collateral vessels, which often lead to the formation and rupture of aneurysms.2 This hypothesis suggests the potential benefit of the flow-reduction strategy using bypass to counter aneurysmal growth.While some researchers have stressed the devastating nature of MMD-associated aneurym,16,17 others have suggested that such aneurysms can spontaneously disappear with the progression of MMD.18,19 Spontaneous disappearance of ACoA aneurysm can occur in unilateral MMD if the contralateral ICA gradually becomes occluded.Conception and design: Funaki, Nakajima, Miyamoto.Acquisition of data: Funaki, Nakajima.

The two largest compound screens reported to date are this study and the screen of the 12,000 compound ReFRAME library (Riva et al., 2020).Whereas these findings are encouraging and suggest drug-repurposing as a productive approach for rapidly identifying treatments, it is important to be mindful that unexpected drug-disease interactions may occur when used for a different purpose, necessitating prospective clinical trial assessments.Nir HacohenN/ARRL.sin.cPPT.SFFV/ACE2.IRES-puroAddgeneCat#145839psPAX2AddgeneCat#12260pMD2.GAddgeneCat#12259Software and algorithmsCellProfilerMcQuin, C. et al.Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody from ThermoFisher (Waltham, MA, USA) was added to cells for 2 h, cells were washed in PBS, and Hoechst 33342 dye was added to stain cell nuclei.Compounds were dosed out at three concentrations-their respective IC90s, plus 5-fold above and below.Foci of infected cells were counted and titers calculated.As shown in Figure S1, the significant bits for strong drugs appear to be moderately bigger and potentially more meaningful for binding, with 22 bits in the Strong Class with average size greater than the database median, compared to only 1 bit for ‘Cyto’, cytotoxic class.

Such an interface instability could prove detrimental when ultrathin phase-pure 2D layers are needed to combine performance with stability.For the 4D STEM measurements, an electron probe with a convergence angle of 0.2 mrad was adjusted and further defocused by typically 5 to 10 Î¼m to increase the real-space probe size to several tens of nanometers in diameter, thus reducing the electron fluence below threshold values for radiation damage.{110} 3D reflections are indicated in ochre color.Grain boundaries can often serve as diffusion shortcuts, and in polycrystalline HaP films as in this case (and thus also in HaP-based photovoltaic devices with 2D/3D bilayer configuration), they can promote fast in- or interdiffusion of organic amines/ammonium cations.5 G and H) after the possible interdiffusion.

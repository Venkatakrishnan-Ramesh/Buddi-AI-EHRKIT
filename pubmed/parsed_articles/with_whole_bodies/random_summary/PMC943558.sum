Pathological analysis reveals lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive cells and characteristic storiform fibrosis.Lab results showed mild eosinophilia (7.8%) and normocytic anemia.The mass has an apparent dural tail that extends to the midclivus (white arrow) and the odontoid base (white arrow).A: Complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus.3C).Macroscopically, extensive dural involvement and nonspecific bony changes were consistent with en plaque meningioma.The tissue demonstrated marked lymphocytic inflammation, with numerous plasma cells positive for CD138 (Fig.C: Immunostaining for CD138 shows a rich plasma cell component.A follow-up serum test after 1 month revealed normalization of her IgG4 levels.The median age at diagnosis was 58 years.In a 2021 systematic review of more than 1,352 cases of IgG4-RD,20 357 cases included head and neck involvement.Of these, only a handful of cases described calvarial involvement, mainly of the temporal bone (eight cases).This article combines a rare neurological presentation (isolated hypoglossal nerve palsy and a unique clinical entity) of IgG-RD pseudotumor mimicking a foramen magnum meningioma with IgG4-related CRS and hypodense calvarial lesions.Study supervision: Soustiel.

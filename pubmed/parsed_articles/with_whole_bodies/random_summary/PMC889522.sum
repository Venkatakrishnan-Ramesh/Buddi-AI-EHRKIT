Oily fish intake was positively associated with sleep quality among 677 adults in Ecuador (24).AA is a metabolically regulated precursor of a prostaglandin D2, a potent sleep promoter (25), suggesting a possible role of n-6 PUFAs with sleep.Details of participating cohorts, study participants, and fatty acid assessment and methods for ascertainment of sleep duration and difficulty falling asleep are presented in the Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Figure 1.Cohort-specific results were entered into a standardized form and compiled centrally; the results were then pooled using meta-analysis.PUFAs were evaluated as a continuous linear variable in a unit of the study-specific interquintile range (IQR, i.e., the difference between the midpoint of the top and bottom quintiles, the 90th and 10th percentiles) and, in separate models, as study-specific quintiles as indicator variables (quintile 1 as referent) to assess potential nonlinear associations.Meta-analyses were performed using R version 3.4.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) and Stata 14.2 (StataCorp LLC).Forest plot of associations between n-3 and n-6 PUFAs per IQR and difficulty sleeping.Preclinical evidence provides biologic plausibility supporting these findings through direct or downstream effects of PUFAs.Melatonin production in mice deficient in DHA or with a low DHA:AA ratio in the brain is dysregulated and the sleepâ€“wake cycles are disturbed (19, 37, 38).ALA conversion to EPA and DHA is limited (43).Pooling of de novo, individual-level analyses offers many benefits over meta-analyses of published studies, including direct standardization of exposures, outcomes, covariables, and statistical methods, which reduces bias and heterogeneity arising from methodological variations.

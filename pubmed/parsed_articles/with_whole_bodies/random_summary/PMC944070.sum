Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine prognostic features.Most recent imaging studies (CT or MRI) prior to initiation of systemic therapy with atezolizumab-bevacizumab were reviewed by a fellowship trained abdominal radiologist.Univariate analysis was performed using the Kaplanâ€“Meier method to determine features having a statistically significant (p < 0.05) association with overall survival and progression-free survival.Twenty-one patients were excluded from the analysis because they received surgical or percutaneous interventions to intrahepatic disease foci after initiation of systemic therapy.Despite this, small volume ascites/pleural effusion were independent factors predictive of overall and/or progression-free survival.In addition, the group of previously treated patients consisted of a heterogeneous group of patients who had received a variety of surgical interventions, percutaneous ablation procedures, chemo/radioembolization and/or different lines of systemic therapy (including investigational drugs).

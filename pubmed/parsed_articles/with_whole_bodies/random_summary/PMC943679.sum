At the time of this publication, this approach to SHAM is a novel introduction to cardiac arrest studies in preclinical models.7 There were therefore four treatment groups used in the study; SHAM-ADR, SHAM+ADR, CA-ADR and CA+ADR.1).Notably, in mice that achieved ROSC, adrenaline was associated with a 3-fold greater rate of mortality (n = 10 of 21 (48 %) in CA+ADR vs n = 2 of 14 (14 %) in CA-ADR, P = 0.041) (Fig.Survival outcomes in cardiac arrest with (CA + ADR) and without (CA-ADR) adrenaline for ROSC and survival to planned endpoint.Furthermore, CA, independent of adrenaline status, resulted in a greater degree of relative myocardial fibrosis determined through Masson trichrome staining (Fig.3Cardiac biomarkers and myocardial fibrosis.A) Plasma high-sensitivity troponin measured in 24 and 72-h cohorts.*P < 0.05, **P  < 0.01, ***P < 0.001.Assessment of plasma cytokines (Supplemental Fig.*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001.Survival from OHCA remains poor despite concerted public health initiatives and incremental improvements in resuscitative care.9., 10., 11.Finally, we acknowledge that the murine inflammatory response to cardiac arrest might differ to that in humans.Aascha A.

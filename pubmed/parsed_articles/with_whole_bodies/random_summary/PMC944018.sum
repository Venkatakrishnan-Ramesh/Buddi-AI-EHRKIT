While very few countries have National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups that analyze economic information, many have started to develop processes for this purpose.We interviewed Canadian vaccine experts involved in provincial vaccine policy decision making to identify current practices, perceptions, and recommendations around incorporating economic analysis into that process.Under these conditions, it is not surprising that the number of economic evaluations of vaccines, along with guidelines and methods to inform economic research in the area [1â€“9], have increased over time.Provincial and territorial Ministries of Health develop and implement vaccine policy, often with input from regional vaccine advisory committees.This will help to address common misconceptions about economic analyses and facilitate communication with healthcare decision makers as well as the public4A clear, systematic and routine process for incorporating economic analysis into the provincial or territorial decision-making process is required, including clear guidelines and criteria for when economic evaluations are not relevant, when available economic evidence is sufficient, and when more localized analyses may be needed5Specific roles and responsibilities for each party (national and regional) should be identified, recognizing opportunities for synergy between stakeholders.All provincial experts we consulted viewed economic analysis as an important element in vaccine decision making, providing additional insight necessary to clarify the value of a new vaccine or immunization program, with the potential to facilitate communication with both healthcare decision makers and the public.The vaccine experts we consulted recommended a routine and systematic process for incorporating economic analysis in vaccine policy decision making.By sharing processes, challenges, and recommendations, we hope to create an opportunity for regional health authorities and advisors to work collaboratively with national partners, creating transparent and effective approaches to incorporating economic analysis into vaccine decision making across all levels of government.

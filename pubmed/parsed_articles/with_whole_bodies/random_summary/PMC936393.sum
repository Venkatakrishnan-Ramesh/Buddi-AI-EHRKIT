Descriptive statistics, Pearson’s chi-square test, and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to analyze the data.Approximately 71% of the participants participated in low/insufficient levels of physical activity.Moderate to high levels of physical activity are associated with substantially lower morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes (4, 5).In this regard, the determination of factors associated with successfully maintaining sufficient levels of activity despite this critical situation is important.The questionnaire package comprised (1) sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, (2) physical activity level, (3) diabetes-specific social support, (4) feelings of isolation and loneliness, and (5) diabetes-related distress.A high level was characterized as 7 days in the form of walking and moderate- and vigorous-intensity activities equaling 3,000 MET-minute/week.This scale has four subscales, namely emotional burden, physician distress, regimen distress, and interpersonal distress, and it is possible to calculate a total score for the scale.Continuous variables are shown as mean ± standard deviation, and categorical variables are shown as numbers (%).Secondly, the data on the physical activity levels of the studied patients corresponding to before the COVID-19 era were not collected; therefore, there was no information on the exact level of patients’ activity before this crisis.The present study also explored that insufficient physical activity was significantly associated with being female, higher age, obesity, presence of diabetes-related complications, feelings of isolation, and higher levels of distress related to diabetes.

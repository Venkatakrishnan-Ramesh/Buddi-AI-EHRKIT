All the analyses were conducted using R (version 4.0.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).Note: “Comm connect,” the index of community connectivity; “Floating volume,” the index of floating volume; “Employee,” the number of employees; “Pop density,” the household population density; “House density,” the house density; “Pers per house,” the number of persons per house; “GDP,” the gross domestic product; “Large company,” the number of large-size companies; “Hospital,” the number of hospitals; “School,” the number of schools; “Bed,” the number of hospital beds; “Physician,” the number of physicians; “First infection,” the number of first reported infections; “Prior infection,” “Prior recovery,” and “Prior death,” represent the infection cases, recovery rates, death rates before the effective date of the return to work order.Pearson correlation coefficients between the two variables were 0.93 (P<0.05), 0.99 (P<0.05), and 0.99 (P<0.05) for lifting the intercity restrictions, the intra-city restrictions, and the two restrictions simultaneously.Although lifting mobility restrictions increased cases and death rates for an average city, the effects varied greatly across cities.Nonetheless, the liftings showed similar increases in recovery rates across cities, regardless of the types of lifting.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a contrast-enhancing cystic process in the cervicomedullary junction.Von Hippel-Lindau disease increases the risk of pheochromocytoma and hemangioblastoma.After surgery, the patient was extubated without new neurological deficits.The NE doses required ranged from 0.02 µg/kg/min to 0.10 µg/kg/min.The synthetic mineralocorticoid with glucocorticoid effect (fludrocortisone acetate, Florinef) reduced the need for NE.Manipulation in the proximity of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NS) in the dorsomedial medulla during tumor surgery was the most likely explanation for the postoperative orthostatic hypotension.Overall, the reports show a poor clinical outcome, with death in 5 out of 14 cases, and varying effect of compressive garments, volume expansions, mineralocorticoids, and sympathomimetics.

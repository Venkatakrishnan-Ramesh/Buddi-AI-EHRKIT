Preoperative LD placement is effective in allowing for maximal extent of resection of SWMs and may be considered in cases where local CSF release is not possible.If this is likely to be a challenge, or anticipate minimal release, we will routinely place a preoperative LD.Its presence often favors our use of LD as to not potentially worsen the edema by need for retraction.All tumors are next debulked internally, with various microsurgical techniques used depending on the tumor's consistency, which leads to additional brain relaxation.The dural flap is excised in all cases and is replaced with a dural graft sutured into place.All patients met at least one of the above criteria and are summarized in.Patients with SWMs that did not meet these criteria and did not undergo LD-assisted surgery during this time frame were excluded.Encasement of the major arteries, including the internal carotid artery, its bifurcation, and the proximal anterior and middle cerebral arteries were observed in eight patients (. )He later underwent adjuvant radiotherapy followed with serial imaging without evidence of tumor recurrence.Opening the optic carotid cistern and sylvian fissure can be useful to facilitate most SWM removal.It may also be beneficial with tumors located in the dominant hemisphere, where avoidance of brain manipulation is important to preserving function.We recommend its use on a case-by-case basis based on the criteria defined in this study.

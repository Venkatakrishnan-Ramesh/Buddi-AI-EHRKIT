Due to resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, MERS and Influenza virus, airborne mode of transmission was emphasized.Our institutional recommendations were based on Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations[45] which were modified to suit our needs.For the purpose of the study, recommended HH is acceptable.Only 50% of the patients were shifted out of OT to post anesthesia care unit (PACU) with surgical face masks and 3.2% of our patients were shifted to ICU intubated.The technique of holding a mask, when ventilated, continued to be mainly EC in 54.1%, whereas 5.5% modified their mask-holding technique to VC as suggested by many studies during COVID-19 pandemic.After intubation, the cuff was inflated before connecting to the closed circuit in 72.5% of the cases.The larger respiratory particles (>5 mm) are contained in a meter radius due to gravitational force and thus bring in the importance of social distancing of 2 m and PPEs usage.Smaller particles <5 mm circulates in air for prolonged periods and get absorbed by respiratory mucosa and conjunctivae of the personals breathing the same air.During non-COVID-19 times, we noticed the presence of four to seven HCWs at the time of AGPs routinely.Compliance rate for surgical gown was observed to be 64.7% and 72.9% at intubation and extubation, respectively.

Thirty-one patients met criteria, their treatments were performed between 1999 and 2013.Anatomical locations of the primary tumors included two proximal femoral tumors, twenty distal femoral tumors, seven proximal tibial tumors, and two distal tibial tumors.The ROIs were identified by an orthopaedic oncologist by tracing the periphery of all tumors on the PostC lateral radiographs; regions of interest (ROIs) of normal bone were also identified.Each patient’s PreC and PostC images were co-registered by identifying identical anatomical landmarks in both images.The accuracy of the co-registered PreC and PostC images was measured using another validated and open-source software extension imshowpair.m.Mean luminance values for PreC and PostC tumor were 0.65±0.12 and 0.64±0.10, respectively.[1] showed moderate correlation—Pearson correlation coefficient (ρ) of 0.36 (P=0.038)—with the tumor necrosis value (Figure 2B).They were unable, however, to demonstrate a correlation to changes on radiographs.We were unable to account for the imager settings—kilovoltage peak and milliamp seconds—and the source-to-image distance used to obtain the radiographs.

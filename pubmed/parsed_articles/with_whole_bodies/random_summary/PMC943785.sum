The primary culprit of this deception was likely the honey bee-mimicking Eristalis tenax (Syrphidae), a cosmopolitan hoverfly that occasionally lays its eggs on carcasses (Osten-Sacken, 1894) (Scholl et al., 2019).Our study is related to the above-referenced work (Ezray et al., 2019) in that we also employ the t-SNE technique (Van der Maaten and Hinton 2008).We trained three AI models separately on color images only, grayscale images only, and an equal combination of color and grayscale images.When comparing training with color images vs. grayscale images, we notice a trend of grayscale images giving a consistently similar performance.Table 9 presents the critical hyperparameters in this architecture for training and validation.To execute the technique, we compute the output features generated at the final convolution layer of the CNN.

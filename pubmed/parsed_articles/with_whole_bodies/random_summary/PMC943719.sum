Each patient provided written informed consent to participate in the study before study initiation, and all authors consented to publication of the manuscript.Statistical analyses were performed using SAS® software version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA), without imputation for missing values (unless otherwise noted).Assuming that 5% of patients would not have data available at month 2 (primary time point), enrollment of 400 patients was planned.Recall refers to a dexamethasone intravitreal implant (DEX) recall on 4 October 2018. aReasons for ineligibility included absence of inflammation of the posterior segment due to non-infectious uveitis, age or residency criteria not met, and participation in another clinical study.There was, however, no statistically significant difference in mean duration of uveitis between patients who received DEX on day 0 and those who did not.3).DEX also produced statistically significant reductions in mean vitreous haze and mean CRT, confirming its anti-inflammatory properties and efficacy in improving anatomic outcomes in patients treated with DEX on day 0.Moreover, the most common AEs of special interest reported in the CONSTANCE study (i.e., cataract formation, cataract progression, increased IOP, vitreous hemorrhage, ocular hypertension, and glaucoma [20]) are also in line with the AE profile reported herein.Study limitations include the sample size, which was smaller than planned at enrollment and during follow-up (especially at 18 months), due to the product recall and consequent study termination.

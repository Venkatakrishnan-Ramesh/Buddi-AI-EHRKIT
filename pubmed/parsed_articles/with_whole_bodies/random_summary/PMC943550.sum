In addition, most studies had relatively small sample sizes (<200 patients; range 19–1632),13–15,17,18,20,21,26,27 and sample representativeness may have been limited.Furthermore, previous studies reported relatively low detection sensitivities (59%–81%) for small lesions (≤5–6 mm)16,26 or high number of false positives (FPs; up to 302 per person),18,21,24,25 indicating that an optimized model is needed.For all prospective sets, the BMs were independently confirmed by three experts (with 30, 28, and 11 years of experience, respectively) from three hospitals.We recruited nine radiologists from three hospitals (SYSUCC, MZPH, DGPH) with varying degrees of experience (trainee [< 3 years], experienced [5–10 years], and expert [> 10 years]).For the patient-based analysis, the mean AUC of the reading was not significantly different between the two reading modes (0.960 [95% CI: 0.949–0.970] without BMD vs 0.948 [95% CI: 0.937–0.960] with BMD, P > .05, Figure 3B), even when trainee and experienced reader subgroups were analyzed (0.957 [95% CI: 0.942–0.972] without BMD vs 0.958 [95% CI: 0.943–0.973] with BMD, P > .05); 0.963 [95% CI: 0.948–0.977] without BMD vs. 0.939 [95% CI: 0.921–0.957] with BMD, P > .05, respectively, Figure 3C).Reading times for trainees and experienced readers were reduced by 47% and 32%, respectively, with BMD.A similar CAD-aided BM detection study reported that readers took an additional 72 s per case using CAD after complete interpretation; however, performance was slightly improved, with a figure-of-merit AUC increasing from 0.874 to 0.898 using CAD.Considering the trade-off between sensitivity and feasibility, our model may be more suitable for broad practical application.Second, only post-contrast T1-weighted MR images were used for this study to reflect what is commonly used in practice.

Functional studies revealed a delayed polyP release kinetics for Ca-polyP-NP embedded in a hydrogel due to NP/coacervate conversion.The light microscopical images were taken with a VHX-600 Digital Microscope (Keyence, Neu-Isenburg, Germany).The respective polyP polymer either as free Na-polyP or in combination with particulate Ca-polyP-NP was embedded in a 2% aqueous hydrogel prepared from hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC; Caelo, Hilden; Germany).Broadly, the coacervate is formed at neutral pH, while NP form at pH ∼10.The change of the turbidity was followed by measuring the changes in the absorbance at 700 ​nm.(II.)(III.)In contrast, at pH 10, the pH condition at which the nanoparticles “Ca-polyP-NP” are formed (Fig.(II.)In the coacervate hydrogel, the characteristic νas(PO2)− signal is present (circled).Microscopic images reflecting the phase transformation of the nanoparticles (np) into the coacervate (Coa) phase.(B) PVA supplemented with “Ca-polyP-NP” with 100 ​nm nanoparticles (np); SEM.Therefore, the release kinetics from the hydrogel was determined with “Ca-polyP-NP” as the sole component.(C) In cultures on “PVA/polyP:Coa”, however, the staining is significantly stronger and the density of the cells is higher.NP in the cytoplasm of A549 ​cells and distribution of ALP in A549 ​cells, the enzyme that hydrolyzes the polyP in NP.High concentrations of polyP with a chain length between 40 and 150 Pi units are present in the acidocalcisomes (reviewed in: [21]).The supplementation of the PVA hydrogel with Na-polyP already shows a strong increase in medium/serum after 2 ​d, which even increases in the four following days and has reached 72% after 9 ​d.The third distinguished feature of polyP is the harvesting of the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) liberated in parallel with the enzymatic cleavage of the energy-rich phosphoanhydride bonds within the polyP chains, leading to ADP formation [21].

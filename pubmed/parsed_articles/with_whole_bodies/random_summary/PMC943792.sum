To this end, ERAD substrates are extracted by the AAA+ ATPase p97, deglycosylated by an N-glycanase, and targeted to the proteasome (Ye et al., 2001).Although we previously observed that degradation kinetics in Hek293T cells were unaffected by RHBDL4 knockdown for RI332 (Fleig et al., 2012), processing of RI332 by an unknown ER protease had been observed before (Mueller et al., 2006).Within this stretch, four small residues are found in two pairs, namely glycine-121 (G121), cysteine-122 (C122), glycine-125 (G125), and serine-126 (S126).Among the 20 proteins that showed enrichment in the RHBDL4-FLAG fraction greater than 1.4-fold were the chaperones BiP and calreticulin; two protein disulfide isomerases, namely PDI and Erp44; and both subunits of the regulatory glucosidase II (Table S2).Protein aggregation is associated with aging and human disorders ranging from diabetes to neurodegeneration (Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015).For RHBDL4, the default pathway appears to be substrate clipping and retrotranslocation of cleavage fragments.Generation of chromosomally tagged RHBDL4-FLAG Hek293T cells with a single FLAG before the stop codon in the last exon by using CRISPR/Cas12 mediated gene editing has been described before (Fueller et al., 2020).

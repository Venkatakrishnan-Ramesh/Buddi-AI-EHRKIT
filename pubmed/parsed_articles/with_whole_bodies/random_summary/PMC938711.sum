The target for recruitment for the overall RESPPONSE study was 750 participants in each of nine five-year age strata, based on an estimated COVID-19 prevalence of 2 % at the time of the study [8].Most participants reported female sex-at-birth (87.1 %), with 1.2 % identifying as gender diverse (Table 1).The strong association between future seasonal influenza vaccine intention and COVID-19 vaccine intention remained after adjusting for other key factors previously identified as associated with vaccine intention [8].Our findings indicate that in this cohort, future intention to receive an influenza vaccine is strongly associated with intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.Vaccine hesitancy or acceptance is a spectrum, with one end being vaccine refusers, who are estimated to comprise a small minority (2–4 %) of the population, which is consistent with our findings.We found that 9.0 % of the participants retrospectively reported a positive change in their perceived value of vaccines, and 84.0 % reported a sustained positive perceived value of vaccines from before to during the pandemic.In regards to study timing, we did not measure vaccine intentions at the time of information release regarding vaccine safety signals for rare potential side effects, which may have also impacted intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.We found an increase in intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after public announcements of vaccine approval, which highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring of vaccine uptake, and acceptability, as information on vaccine developments continue to emerge.

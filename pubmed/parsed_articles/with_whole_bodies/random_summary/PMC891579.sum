The DD mediates antiparallel dimerization (8).ABS3 (light blue) is immobilized via an N-terminal HaloTag domain on a microscope coverslip sparsely decorated with 1.5-μm-diameter platform beads.Drosophila with ABS3 mutations that disrupt F-actin–binding show defects in germband retraction resembling talin-null embryos as well as defects in embryonic muscle–tendon attachment and epithelial sheet adhesion in the adult wing (16, 17).If displacement was detected, then the stage paused until both beads relaxed to their starting positions before restarting the oscillation.An actin filament is then attached to both trapped beads.Traces corresponding to actin dumbbells that yielded fewer than two long (>0.5 s) events were excluded from analysis for both ABS3 and NTD-ABS3 in the loaded assay, as the orientation of these filaments could not be clearly determined.

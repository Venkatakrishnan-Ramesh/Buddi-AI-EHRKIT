The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the second-generation basal insulin glargine 300 Units/mL (Gla-300) may be of benefit in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).For this reason, many national and international diabetes associations recommend targeting glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of 48–53 mmol/mol (6.5–7.0%) for the majority of T1DM patients [7, 8].BG blood glucose, GIR glucose infusion rate, INS mean insulin concentration, LLOQ lower limit of quantification, LOESS locally estimated scatterplot smoothing.In the study by Porcellati et al.The primary and secondary endpoints were the variation of HbA1c from baseline to Month 6 and the incidence and rates of hypoglycaemia (nocturnal and 24 h), respectively.The lower proportion of patients who experienced episodes of hyperglycaemia with ketosis observed in the Gla-300 group suggests that Gla-300 provides a uniform and continuous glycaemic control over 24 h. However, further studies are needed to investigate whether Gla-300 may be a suitable therapeutic option for such populations.In this pilot study, the authors focused on a small population of children who may have been entering their honeymoon phase or have been otherwise unstable, therefore the findings are purely indicative and cannot be generalised.

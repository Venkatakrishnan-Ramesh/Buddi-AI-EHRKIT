After surgery, cervical sagittal alignment was improved, and they could walk maintaining horizontal gaze.All cases were treated with physiotherapy, together with the combination of a cervical brace, for at least 3 months.His global sagittal spinal alignment was type D. His first visit was 5 months after onset (Grade 3), and the difficulty of horizontal gaze improved due to physiotherapy and a cervical brace fixation at 7 months after the first visit (Grade 1) (Fig.At the C6â€“7 interspinous space, STIR MRI showed high signal change, and both echography and pathological findings showed angiogenesis (Fig.Previous literature has reported that fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI showed diffuse muscular edema of the cervical extensor muscles.9,10 Echography and pathological findings during the chronic phase revealed the presence of angiogenesis in the elongated interspinous space.Because their first intervention was more than 4 months after onset, conservative treatment was not effective at all.Critically revising the article: Endo, Aihara, Suzuki.Study supervision: Endo, Yamamoto.

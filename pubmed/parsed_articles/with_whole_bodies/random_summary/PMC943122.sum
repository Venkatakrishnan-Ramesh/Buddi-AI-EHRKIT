Finally, new mechanisms of drug delivery are under investigation, including delivery with the GemRIS (TAR-200) device and delivery of intravesical chemotherapy at higher temperatures.We performed a narrative review using PubMed, Google Scholar, Clinical Key, and Wiley Online Library of articles between the years of 1980 and 2021.For clinical trial information, we searched www.clinicaltrials.gov.Intravesical BCG is the recommended therapy for patient with high-risk NMIBC.Efforts have been made to clearly delineate categories of BCG failure.A study by Miyamota et al.Through E2F, CG0070 replicates and enhances granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GC-CSF), activating the immune system and destroying tumor cells.Only 6% of patients experienced a Grade III adverse effect without any Grade IV/V.Adverse events were experienced by 83% of the cohort, most commonly fatigue.While the development and administration of intravesical therapies has been pioneered by urologists, the role of the urologist becomes more ambiguous with novel systemic therapies on the horizon.

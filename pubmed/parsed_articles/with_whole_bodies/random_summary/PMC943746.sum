The surgeon must ensure appropriate spacing of drill holesAC, acromioclavicular; CC, coracoclavicular.Attention is then turned to the AC joint.Semitendinosus or tibialis anterior allograft or autograft may be used.Dog Bone button is loaded onto suture and tensioned until clavicle reduces into anatomic position.Semitendinosus allograft (graft #1) is passed inferior to superior around the posterior aspect of the clavicle.Fig 6Semitendinosus autograft fixation.While the CC ligament may portend vertical stability, isolated reconstruction of the CC ligament is subjected to greater horizontal forces without the stress shielding presence of AC ligaments.25,26 In their biomechanical study, Gonzalez-Lomas et al.16 highlights the importance of the AC ligaments as horizontal stabilizers, reporting a 50% decrease in horizontal translation when both AC and CC ligaments are repaired compared with free tissue isolated CC ligament reconstruction.Walters et al.27 further investigated the clinical importance of AC ligament reconstruction in their matched cohort study.

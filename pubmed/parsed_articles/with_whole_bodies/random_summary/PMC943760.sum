Care must be taken at this time to clear soft tissue medial to the coracoid process fracture.The fibrous tissue is debrided back to fresh bleeding bone edges on the coracoid process.The K-wire can be driven through the center of the entire distal fragment and then used as a joystick to anatomically reduce the distal fragment to the proximal fragment.The drill guide is inserted through an accessory antero-inferolateral portal (I portal).Accurate screw length is assessed on the AP view.

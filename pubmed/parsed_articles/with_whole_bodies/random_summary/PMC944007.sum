The harvested CM was further analyzed for IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) using an ELISA Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocols.Briefly, naïve CD4+ T cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 μL of human T cell nucleofector solution, and 10 μg plasmid was added.Cells were electroporated using the nucleofector program V-024 in the Amaxa Nucleofector apparatus (Lonza) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium (Gibco), which was replenished 6 h after transfection.They strongly expressed exosomal markers (CD63, CD81, ALIX and TSG101) but showed low expression of the mitochondrial marker (COX IV) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers (Calreticulin and Bip) (Fig.S3A and B).(F) Iodixanol density gradient centrifugation analysis showing that B7–H4 co-fractionated with exosome marker CD63 and late endosome marker Rab7.The antibody against B7–H4 (Cat# 252,438, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was used.(D) The levels of T-bet and FoxP3 were measured using western blotting.(E) ALIX and ATM interact with each other.Moreover, previous studies confirmed that activated STAT3 could promote B7–H4 expression [20].Thus, we hypothesized that irradiation might increase B7–H4 expression via ATM-phosphorylated STAT3.S6E–G and Table S5).6Irradiation induces phosphorylation of STAT3 through ATM and increases the expression of exosomal B7–H4.(C) Endogenous ATM and STAT3 interact with each other in LN229 (upper panel) and LN308 (lower panel) cell lines.Similarly, IP assays demonstrated an increase in STAT3 phosphorylation upon irradiation of a GBM cell line (Fig.Moreover, the ATM inhibitor decreased the exosomal B7–H4 level (Fig.8Exosomal B7–H4 reduces Th1 cell differentiation via STAT1 pathway activation.The TME of GBM promotes tumorigenesis and the development of radio-resistance [6,7].In this study, we examined the effect of radiation on tumor-infiltrating immune cells.Moreover, irradiation could cause the accumulation of immunosuppressive cells including Treg in the TME, increased suppressive Tregs by promoting their proliferation [23].Similarly, our results indicated that STAT3 expression is associated with poor survival.

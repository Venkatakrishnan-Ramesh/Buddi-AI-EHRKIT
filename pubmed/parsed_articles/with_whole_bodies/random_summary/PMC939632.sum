Iron reduction therapy could potentially reduce steatosis and insulin resistance, as well as serum transaminase activity in patients with NASH/NAFLD.9–11 However, treatment of iron overload presents some challenges.To investigate the anti-steatotic effects of Hamp, we fed mice a CDAA diet for 16 weeks, which is commonly used to induce steatosis in mouse models of NASH.HE staining showed evidence of hepatic steatosis (primarily as micro- and macro-steatosis) in the CDAA-fed mice, and rAAV2/8-Hamp treatment remarkably decreased the hepatic lipid deposition in the CDAA-fed mice compared to the rAAV2/8-NC treatment (Fig.To further evaluate the role of Hamp in hepatocyte adiponectin expression, we transfected mouse hepatocyte AML12 cells with either the plRES2-Hamp or plRES2-NC plasmid (Fig.Finally, we evaluated liver fibrosis in the CDAA- and CSAA-fed mice treated with rAAV2/8-Hamp after 16 weeks.Collagen deposition and HSC activation were significantly increased in the CDAA-fed mice compared to the CSAA-fed mice, and rAAV2/8-Hamp treatment reduced these fibrosis markers in the CDAA-fed mice, as assessed by SR staining and IHC detection of αSMA (Fig.5A–C).Since our main focus is understanding how to best treat NASH-related fibrosis, we established the CDAA mouse model to best mirror pathology and pathogenesis of human NASH.As iron loads increase, Hamp expression also increases in hepatocytes, resulting in elevated serum Hamp level.25 Patients with chronic liver diseases have evidence of liver dysfunction and anemia associated with inflammation but surprisingly also have lower serum Hamp levels compared to control subjects.26 Similar findings have been reported in alcoholic chronic liver diseases,27 chronic hepatitis C,28,29 hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis,30–33 and in autoimmune liver diseases.34 Hamp levels in NAFLD are difficult to interpret, since Hamp expression is likely to be regulated by complex mechanisms in response to diverse pathophysiological stimuli.Specifically, other aspects of metabolic dysregulation are not necessarily accounted for because hepatic lipid accumulation in the model is mainly due to impaired secretion of very low-density lipoprotein.Therefore, regulation of Hamp and consequently iron homeostasis need to be further investigated.

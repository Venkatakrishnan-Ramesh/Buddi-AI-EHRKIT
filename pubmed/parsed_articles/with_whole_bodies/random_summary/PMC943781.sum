In particular, PCSF yielded 175 signaling networks between macrophages and T cells, 250 signaling networks between monocytes and T cells, and 164 signaling networks between dendritic cells and T cells.After incubation, cell mixtures were stained with anti-IFNÎ³ (1: 100, BioLegend, 505808, RRID:AB_315402), anti-GZMB (1: 100, BioLegend, 372211, RRID:AB_2728378), anti-CD69 (1: 100, BioLegend, 104511, RRID:AB_493565), anti-CD8a (1: 200, BioLegend, 100706, RRID:AB_312745) or control IgG antibodies for FACs analysis.After normalization of gene expression and principal component analysis (PCA), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analyses revealed 28 unsupervised clusters across all cells (Supplementary Figure 1).(c) A pie chart demonstrates the proportions of each cell type in GBM.(b-c) Pseudotime analysis demonstrates a major transition starting from OPC- and NPC-like to mesenchymal cells.(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.).Right, a linear relationship was evaluated using Pearson correlation.Color encodes the average expression level across all cells (blue is low, red is high), while the dot size corresponds to the percentage of cells expressing the feature gene.(For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.).and Y.Z.

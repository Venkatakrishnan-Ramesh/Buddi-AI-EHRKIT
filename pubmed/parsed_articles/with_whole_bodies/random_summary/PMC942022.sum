Various strategies have been proposed to overcome these problems, among which the solid dispersion (SD) is one of the most effective approaches.Dissolution examinations of CA powder and prepared SDs and PMs were performed using USP type II (paddle) dissolution test apparatus (Erweka DT6R, Germany) in 900 mL phosphate buffer solution (pH = 6.8) (19).At various time intervals up to 90 min, 2 mL of the medium was collected and replaced with the same quantity of fresh buffer.Solubility tests were performed by adding excess amounts of each sample into 10 mL distilled water and stirring it continuously for 48 h at 25 ± 0.5°C.Significance was tested at 0.05 level of probability.Other ratios, except for FM-0.25, also showed enhanced DE60 (P < 0.01) compared to CM.Reducing CA: myrj ratio, resulted in higher dissolution rate which was more noticeable for JM-1, confirmed by RD value equal to 7.27.Although both drug and polymer endotherms were appeared for F-1 and F-1PM, the melting point reduction was detected for F-1 formulation.Crystal size reduction as well as disorders in the drug crystal lattice induced by wet milling process (37) can lower the drug melting point.A melting peak at the onset temperature of 42.5 °C was clearly visible in the thermogram of myrj 52, which was consistent with the results reported by the literature (39) (Figure 4II).

A predominantly serum-derived interstitial fluid (ISF) is assumed to flow through the endomysium and perimysium.For such approaches to be of value to pharmaceutical scientists, a tractable model that allowed for the rational addition or exclusion of specific ECM and formulation components is required.Col1 and HA were used in hydrogel formats to model potential interactions between the predominant protein and non-protein ECM materials that would be experienced by formulation components following their IM injection.(A) A polystyrene float (1) suspended a 5 mL hydrogel contained within a semi-porous cuvette (2), suspended in interstitial fluid-mimicking buffer (37 °C, pH 7.4) (3).Here, the Col1/HA format was less elastic than the Col1 alone format when considering G'.2Rheological characterisation of 3.2 mg/mL bovine Col1 (circles) and 3.2 mg/mL bovine Col1, 0.5 mg/mL HA (squares) hydrogel formats by (A) frequency sweep, (B) amplitude sweep and (C) flow sweep analysis.Whilst currently undetermined, this may be a relevant in vivo event occurring post-IM injection.GFP-neg all series, n = 3.GFP-std Col1, n = 4.(E & F) Inset magnifies initial release of GFP-pos.In the Col1 only hydrogel, inclusion of L-histidine or acetate reduced GFP-std release to 76% and 63%, respectively (Fig.IM injections result in the distribution of drug formulations within the endomysium and perimysium of striated muscle.HA is one of most prominent of these other elements, functioning as a biological lubricant to retain water and minimize friction between fascial layers during dynamic muscle movement (McCartan et al., 2021).However, GFP-pos generally released slowly from the injection site, independent of hydrogel composition, suggesting specific interactions with the Col1 matrix.While the initial change in pH of the environment is likely to be inconsequential, the results of this change may have a role in drug fate.From the data presented and discussed here, the SIMI appears to allow discrimination of distinct biopharmaceutical properties and can evaluate specific formulation excipients that may impact drug performance at the IM site in a tractable manner.

Note: If different antibodies are used, determine the appropriate concentration of antibodies by titration and set up the panel and compensation matrix prior to the experiment.Scale bars = 500 μM, cells are gated for viable CD11c+ DCs and further assessed for their CD80, CD86, MHC-II, and MHC-I surface expression.Additionally, quality control of DCs can be extended to fully characterize the expression patterns of co-inhibitory vs. co-stimulatory receptors of the transferred DCs.

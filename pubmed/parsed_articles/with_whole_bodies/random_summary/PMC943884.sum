We recommend conducting such studies in different regions of the world to develop relevant and region-specific strategies to help HCWs cope with stress more efficiently, thereby, strengthening the healthcare system to deal with future pandemics.The experience and dilemma of frontline HCWs working in personal protective equipment (PPE) suit has not been studied in detail before.For the study, “PPE kit” consisted of N95/FFP2 mask, gown, gloves, eye protection, shoe covers, and apron.Participation was voluntary with a limit of one response per participant.98.8% of HCWs felt that it was their social and moral responsibility to serve COVID-19 patients, though 81.4% of HCWs also felt that their sense of responsibility was affecting their own safety.The duration of PPE wear among HCWs varied from <6 h (32.3%), 6–8 h (43.4%), and 8–12 h (22.2%) with only 2.1% HCWs working for >12 h in PPE.Population differs in different regions of the world with respect to their stress perception and coping strategies, based on the different socio-cultural practices, economic status, and government policies.We conducted this questionnaire-based cross-sectional observational study to know the sources of stress, psychosocial impact, and coping strategies among frontline HCWs working in PPE kit in Western Rajasthan during the COVID-19 outbreak.A possible explanation could be that women are more likely to develop coping mechanisms to deal with the stress both at the social level and at the workplace as compared to men.A higher level of stress can be expected in the elderly population due to associated co-morbidities and increased exhaustion due to prolonged working hours as has been previously reported by Cai et al.Though stress cannot be avoided in present circumstances, stress-coping measures have become the need of the hour.

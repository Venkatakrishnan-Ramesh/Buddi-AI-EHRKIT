Recently, new biomarkers have been developed for the diagnosis of specific IgE sensitization toward a large variety of individual allergen molecules and for the detection of RV strain–specific IgG antibody responses.Within 2 European Union–funded research projects, that is, MeDALL (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96850/factsheet/en) and PreDicta (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/96868/factsheet/en), 2 multiplex assays have been developed on the basis of chips containing more than 170 different allergen molecules from various allergen sources13 and microarrayed peptides from the VP1 coat proteins of the most common RV strains.14 The MeDALL allergen chip measures IgE antibodies specific for a comprehensive panel of allergen molecules comprising a spectrum of the most common allergen sources, including all important respiratory allergen molecules such as the major house-dust mite allergens, animal-derived allergens, pollen allergens, and mould allergens.Clinical trials to test whether personalization of asthma treatment based on serological identification of possible trigger factors can improve current asthma management guidelines are warranted.

Articles usually show researchers' views on the latest achievements in the related field (1).For this reason, the study of scientific collaboration in the scientific outputs of pituitary diseases can determine the dimensions and scope of collaboration in this field and identify individuals and countries that are superior in various aspects and indices.Which are the top countries based on the most scientific outputs and the number of citations of pituitary diseases in the world and the Middle East between 2000 and 2020?.6. Who are the top authors based on the centrality indices on pituitary diseases in the Web of Science database in the world, the Middle East, and Iran during the years 2000 to 2020?.What is the scientific collaboration map (co-authorship) of authors in the field of pituitary diseases in the Web of Science website in the world, the Middle East, and Iran during the years 2000 to 2020?.The highest and lowest international scientific outputs were published during the years 2018-2020 (n= 5441 articles) and 2000-2002 (n= 3590 articles), respectively.Which are the top countries in the Middle East in the world according to the centrality indices on pituitary diseases in the Web of Science database during the years 2000 to 2020?.With regard to the closeness centrality index, the United States, England, and Italy, and among the Middle East countries, Turkey, Israel and Egypt rank first to third.2.However, in the co-authorship network of Middle Eastern countries, 13 out of 17 Middle Eastern countries have collaborated with each other, including a network consisting of 13 nodes (countries) and 50 links (Fig.Shimon (n=64articles), Kadioglu (n=63 articles), and Erbas (n=41 articles) are the most productive researchers in the field of pituitary disease in the Web of Science database in the Middle East.4).The results are not consistent with the present study in terms of Iran ranking (33); but the results were consistent with the above study in terms of the above variable only during 2018-2020.In order to achieve higher ranks, relevant Iranian authorities need to develop the scientific strength of the country by using the capacities and capabilities of the country's researchers, allocating sufficient funds, supporting public and private sectors in the field of basic and clinical sciences research.It is also recommended to ensure government and industry planning for future growth and development using the strengths of researchers who are in a strategic position and proper clusters relative to other members in the network.

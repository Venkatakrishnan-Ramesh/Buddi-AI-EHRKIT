This review's goal is to synthesize the existing literature into a compendium of excisional goniotomy's indications, technique, efficacy and safety outcomes, and optimal place in glaucoma management.Excisional goniotomy with the KDB effectively lowers IOP and reduces the medication burden in eyes with POAG and other forms of glaucoma across the spectrum of both baseline IOP and disease severity.A Review of Excisional Goniotomy Performed with the Kahook Dual Blade for Glaucoma Management.The strip is then removed from the eye with the KDB or with forceps.Standalone: IOP and medication reductions following standalone surgery have been characterized in one prospective and five retrospective studies of 4–18 months in duration.26–31 In these studies, mean IOP reductions of 11–36% and mean medication reductions of 15–92% (note: one study reported a medication increase of 14% at 18 months30) were reported.These wide ranges likely represent variable proportions of patients in each study undergoing surgery for IOP versus medication reductions.It can be performed by comprehensive ophthalmologists as well as glaucoma specialists.Given the broad base of evidence supporting its use in a wide variety of clinical scenarios, excisional goniotomy with the KDB can play a meaningful role in the achievement of patient-specific glaucoma therapy goals.These aggregate findings support the efficacy and safety of excisional goniotomy with the KDB in a broad array of clinical scenarios and clarify the patient profiles best suited for this procedure.

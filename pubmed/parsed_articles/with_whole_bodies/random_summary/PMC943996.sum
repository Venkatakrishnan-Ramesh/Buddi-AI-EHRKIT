We report a clinical case of ischemic stroke due to severe stenosis of the left internal carotid artery indicated for stent deployment.Symptomatic carotid artery stenosis in high-risk patients is often treated by carotid artery stenting (CAS), which is a less invasive method than carotid endarterectomy (CEA), but stenting is associated with considerable periprocedural risk [1], [2], [3].A transcervical approach may represent an effective alternative in high-risk patients.The patient had no previous history of diabetes, cardiac pathologies, strokes, transient ischemic attacks, thromboembolism, or other vascular pathologies.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain using a 3 Tesla scanner revealed hyperintense lesions on the left hemisphere, affected by severe ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (Fig.3).Fig.(C) The perpendicular origin, showing severe internal carotid artery stenosis (yellow arrow).3:.Second cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results.4:.(D) Unsheathing the first stent (yellow arrow).(G) Angioplasty after in-stent restenosis (green arrow).Atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis, which is responsible for 20% of all strokes, commonly develops at the divergence of the internal and external carotid arteries.

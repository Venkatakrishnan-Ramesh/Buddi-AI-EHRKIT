When considering which DMT to choose, clinicians and patients need to consider individual patient prognostic factors, values, and preferences as well as drug-related factors (adverse effect profile, availability, and burden of administration).DRF demonstrated a significantly improved GI tolerability profile compared with DMF, with significantly fewer days where patients reported a score of ≥ 2 on the patient-reported Individual Gastrointestinal Symptom and Impact Scale (IGISIS), meeting the study’s primary endpoint.For example, in Canada, the 2018 guidance from the Institut national d’excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS) highlights the need for qualitative research to complement the scientific methodology of clinical trials that are “also aimed at better understanding the patients’ experience of the disease, their expectations of…innovative therapy, and their fears” [20] when considering therapeutic value.All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and anonymized.Saturation, the point at which no new relevant information emerges from additional qualitative data [27–29], was assessed, and results were compared to discussions with HCPs to determine whether information elicited in patient interviews aligned with the HCP perspective.Fingolimod and teriflunomide were generally viewed as better tolerated overall, although some HCPs stated that treatment failure (more relapses) was more likely with teriflunomide than other available DMTs.Even making the bed, like—and I said just—it’s amazing how much it actually—it affects every huge moment of my day.”—CA012“Today I have a hard time walking my dog after the medication.”—CA014Work impact“At its height … I remember the days I wouldn’t be off, like when I’d go into work sick like that, I’d be back and forth to the toilet and like to the bathroom in general.They also noted that completing both instruments would not be burdensome to patients if the trial period is not too long.Importantly, though HCPs often characterized GI-related AE symptoms as most intense at treatment titration, patients described symptoms that persist longer and at severity levels that interfere with daily activities even after dose titration and substantial lifestyle adaptation.As described above, in the EVOLVE-MS-2 trial, the IGISIS and GGISIS were used to collect patient experience data to quantify differences in GI tolerability between DMF and a novel oral fumarate DRF [13, 15].

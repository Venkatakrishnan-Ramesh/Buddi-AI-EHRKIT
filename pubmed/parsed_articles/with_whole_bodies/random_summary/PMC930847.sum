A survey targeting US physicians and administrators was developed to assess the impact of drug utilization management on physician practices.This instrument was designed to capture information on drug utilization management related to retail prescriptions and physician-administered medications and was refined based on three pre-test interviews with a primary care physician, a specialist physician, and a specialty practice administrator.Among those invited, 2933 (11.6%) answered the survey eligibility questions.Data quality was assessed by identifying extreme outliers reported for time spent on a given type of drug utilization management, based on a threshold of three times the standard deviation.For this analysis, these responses were scaled down to the physician level using the number of physicians they reported supporting, with tasks related to drug utilization management.found that pharmacist-led centralization of prescription renewals and prior authorization processing had a positive effect on physician efficiency and satisfaction [37].As such, it would be beneficial for future studies to use alternative methods (e.g., time and motion study, time diaries), thereby providing a deeper understanding into the cost of drug utilization management to physician practices.

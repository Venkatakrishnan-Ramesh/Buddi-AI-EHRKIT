A large proportion of the cost is to the healthcare system; this is partially due to the high cost of antenatal care as a result of frequent foetal and maternal surveillance [4] in addition to the costs associated with increased rates of neonatal admission (compared to pregnancies uncomplicated by pre-eclampsia), due to the lower gestational age and a greater number of maternal and infant adverse events [5, 6].The primary long-term infant outcome was neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years of age (adjusted), using the Parent Report of Childrenâ€™s Abilities-Revised (PARCA-R) parent report composite score.We calculated complete-case (women that were followed-up at that time point and completed the questionnaire for themselves and their infant) descriptive statistics for the percentage of women and infants and mean number of contacts for each type of resource use.Descriptive statistics for EQ-5D-5L and the crosswalk algorithm are reported in Table 4.*Adjusted for minimisation factors (centre, singleton/twin pregnancies, severity of hypertension in 48 h prior to enrolment, parity, previous caesarean section and gestational age at randomisation) and predictors of missingness (ethnicity, age, deprivation index and smoking) and EQ-5D-5L tariff at randomisation.2Cost-effectiveness plane of planned delivery compared to expectant management over 24 months (discounted).QALY quality-adjusted life year.Other studies that have evaluated placental growth factor testing as a diagnostic adjunct in the management of suspected pre-eclampsia have found that a majority of the cost in care comes from frequent maternal and foetal monitoring to detect adverse events [4].A complete-case analysis was chosen prior to data analysis as our primary analysis.

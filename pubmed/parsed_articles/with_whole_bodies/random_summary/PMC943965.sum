Patients are asymptomatic between episodes and their growth and development are normal.2–4 Other symptoms which can be present during fever attacks include headache, joint pain, myalgia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.We reviewed the medical records of the patients diagnosed with PFAPA in the last 8 years.A p value below 0.05 was considered significant and below 0.01 was considered highly significant.The family medical history of the patients revealed recurrent fever and pharyngitis (in first and second-degree relatives) in four patients (10.2%) and autoimmune diseases in five patients (12.8%).Test for anti-streptolysin antibody was negative in all children.A family history of recurrent pharyngitis (in first or second-degree relatives) in our group was lower (10.2%) than in other studies which noted a higher incidence (range between 23% and 52%).31–35 A previous case–control study comparing the family history of PFAPA patients with healthy controls subjects found that first-degree relatives (parents and siblings) of patients with PFAPA syndrome have a higher prevalence of recurrent pharyngitis and aphthous stomatitis than relatives of control subjects, suggesting that these disorders could represent reduced penetrance phenotypes of PFAPA determined by an inherited genetic predisposition and/or common environmental exposure.35 These findings raise the possibility of the involvement of genetic factors in PFAPA syndrome etiopathogenesis.Administration of oral corticosteroids did not, however, prevent subsequent episodes of fever and did not change the course of the disease.28 The response rate to a single dose of corticosteroid is different in numerous studies, varying between 63% and 84%.The arguments for tonsillectomy are prevention of the recurrence of further episodes, reducing the severity of the clinical manifestations, and inducing complete remission.

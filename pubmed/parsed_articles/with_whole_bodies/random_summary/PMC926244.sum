The study was conducted in 2019.Severe asthma places a great burden on the health care system, with several unmet needs.An allergic phenotype was defined as a combination of high total serum IgE level (> 100 IU/mL) and a history of allergy..Descriptive statistics were used in order to summarize data (means, standard deviations, medians, and minimum/maximum values for numerical variables; and absolute numbers and percentages for categorical variables).cCumulative inhaled corticosteroid dose is presented on the basis of the equivalent budesonide dose..The median Charlson Comorbidity Index was lower in eosinophilic patients (p = 0.0125; Figure S1).Our results are in accordance with those of several other studies of patients with severe asthma.With regard to the overall characteristics of the study participants, the median age was 54.0 years, most were female, and the proportion of obesity was high.Whereas in eosinophilic patients the inflammatory process could play a predominant role, in noneosinophilic patients, factors such as obesity and other comorbidities might be associated with the occurrence of the exacerbations.It is known that the T2 inflammatory response, which centers around the eosinophil as the final effector cell, can be initiated by an allergic (Th2) or nonallergic (non-Th2) pathway, triggered by external factors such as smoking, viruses, pollutants, and bacteria.

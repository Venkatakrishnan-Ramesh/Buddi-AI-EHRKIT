Noncontiguous double-level Chance fractures that result from a single traumatic event are rarely reported in the literature.The authors report a case of an 18-year-old male who presented to the emergency department after a rollover motor vehicle accident.At 3 months after the operation, clinical assessment revealed no significant back pain and the ability to walk independently.Additionally, rapid radiological imaging is needed to identify the full injury and lead patients to appropriate treatment.The patient was treated by our neurosurgical team via percutaneous stabilization under general anesthesia to address the noncontiguous double-level Chance fractures of bony subtype.Chance fractures are commonly associated with intraabdominal injuries, in which the bowel and mesentery are the most common organs involved.3â€“5 Other less common organs include the liver, spleen, and pancreas.Fortunately, neurological deficits rarely present with Chance fractures.4.Given the long history of missed secondary spinal injuries and mechanism of flexion-distraction injuries, full spine and emergency protocol radiological assessment is needed to identify the lesion in full and assess potential abdominal injuries.Conception and design: MacLennan, Attabib.Critically revising the article: all authors.Study supervision: Attabib.

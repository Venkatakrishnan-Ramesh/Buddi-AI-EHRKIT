The review included studies that used randomized controlled trials to examine the effects of vocal exercise on people with cervical SCI.We screened 1351 articles, of which 4 studies were eligible for inclusion.The worldwide incidence of cervical SCI is approximately 50 people per million.1) Traffic trauma and falls are often the causes of cervical SCI.The average age at injury is 40 years, and incomplete or complete quadriplegia is common among patients with cervical SCI.1) Respiratory dysfunction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cervical SCI and is of particular concern as a severe consequence of cervical SCI.2) The complication rate of respiratory failure among patients hospitalized for cervical SCI has been reported to be approximately 60%.3) Respiratory dysfunction is characterized by low lung volume and a weak cough secondary to respiratory muscle weakness in cervical SCI.4) Weak respiratory muscles result in reduced lung volume, increased frequency of respiratory tract infection, and reduced chest wall compliance.5,6) Additionally, respiratory dysfunction can negatively affect vocal quality by reducing vocal loudness and decreasing phonation length.7,8).This study aimed to investigate the effect of vocal exercise on patients with cervical SCI.Therefore, the potential for bias caused by incomplete outcome data was judged as low in all studies.Recently, research on the effects of vocal exercise has increased.20) In a Cochrane review of general respiratory training for SCI, dropout rates were as high as 8% to 73% in half of the 11 studies.21) In rehabilitation, vocal exercise is one of the alternative tools to improve respiratory training adherence.22) A previous study reported that group vocal exercises for cervical SCI have significant psychological and social benefits.13) In addition, an interesting brain-imaging study showed that vocal exercises improve the respiratory neural plasticity of the cervical SCI.19) Researchers are increasingly focusing on the clinical implications of vocal exercises for cervical SCI.

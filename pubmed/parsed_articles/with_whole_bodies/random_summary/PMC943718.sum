According to Petruscak et al.Surgery can result in a severe slowing of the heart rate and, in some cases, cardiac arrest [2].The study included adult patients of both sexes, aged 18–65 years, who had undergone episcleral buckling procedure surgery under general anaesthesia for retinal detachment.Blood pressure was measured every 5 min during anaesthesia, immediately before eyeball traction, and during the subsequent procedures.P values were two-tailed, and a value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.Efferent impulses travel through the vagus nerve and reach the sinoatrial nodes.Because the OCR (TCR) is a result of sympathetic and parasympathetic imbalance, our aim was to determine whether there was a correlation between the activity of a patient’s autonomic system, measured before anaesthesia and before surgical manipulation, and the occurrence of OCR [15].Several previous attempts to predict OCR have involved monitoring respiratory gases and also brain wave using a bispectral index monitoring system, but these systems were also not highly predictive [17].Arnold et al.The best and definitive way to treat OCR is cessation of the stimulus [13].In such cases, orbital decompression must be considered [33].Our population included only adult patients.The third reason was to exclude the influence of more advanced age, drugs, and diseases; as such, patients were only included if they were ASA class 1 or 2, and retinal detachment more frequently occurs in patients with more comorbidities.Therefore, the decision to focus on patients with ASA class 1 and 2 and aged < 65 years was driven by the fact that older people are more likely to have comorbidities and take a variety of drugs, which may or do have influence on ANS.

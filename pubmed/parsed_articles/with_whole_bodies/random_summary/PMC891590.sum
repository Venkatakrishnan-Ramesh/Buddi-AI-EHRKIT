Consequently, EGFR has become a therapeutic target for the development of anticancer drugs (2, 5).The results showed that HGS glycosylation levels varied when the cells were cultured under different nutrient levels or in the presence of oxidative stress (Fig.***P < 0.001.Data are presented as the mean ± SD of n = 100 cells from three independent experiments.The results showed that the PSAP domain (aa 280–460) that contains the glycosylation sites (S297, S299, and S300) was indispensable for the HGS-STAM interaction.We used HepG2-R cells as the parental cell lines to generate stable cells expressing Flag-tagged WT or 3SA HGS with a simultaneous depletion of the endogenous HGS (SI Appendix, Fig.(E) Immunoblotting of MAPK signaling activation in HepG2-R cells stably expressing WT or 3SA HGS.Interestingly, O-GlcNAcylation has been more commonly found to stabilize protein substrates by antagonizing ubiquitination (39).

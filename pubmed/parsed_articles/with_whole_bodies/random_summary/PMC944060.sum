The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of topical rho-kinase inhibitor ripasudil in the treatment of primary corneal endothelial degeneration (PCED) in dogs.Twenty-one eyes of 12 client-owned, PCED-affected dogs received topical ripasudil 4 times daily.Before and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after initiating treatment with ripasudil, all eyes underwent complete ophthalmic examination, including digital slit-lamp biomicroscopy (Imaging Module IM 900; Haag Streit, Koeniz, Switzerland), handheld slit-lamp biomicroscopy (SL-15; Kowa American Corporation, Torrance, CA), binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy (Keeler Instruments Inc., Broomall, PA) using a 28 diopter (D) indirect lens (Volk Optical, Inc., Mentor, OH), and Schirmer tear-test 1 (STT1; Intervet, Inc., Summit, NJ).The percentage of cornea affected by edema was estimated using digital photographs at each time point and image analysis software (ImageJ, http://www.rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).Twenty-one eyes of 12 PCED-affected dogs were included in the study and examined before and at mean ± standard deviation 1.4 ± 0.4, 3.6 ± 0.5, 6.6 ± 1.7, and 12.9 ± 1.0 months after initiating treatment with ripasudil.(B) A 5-year-old male castrated chihuahua mix demonstrated progressive corneal edema (B1 to B2) and decreased ECD (B3 to B4) from 1324 ± 138 cells/mm2 at baseline to 881 ± 17 cells/mm2 at 12 months.Four ripasudil-treated eyes of two dogs (a Boston terrier and Jack Russell terrier) were excluded due to having bilaterally compensated disease without corneal edema in either eye, leaving 17 ripasudil-treated eyes of 10 dogs for analysis.Seventeen historical control eyes of 10 dogs were selected to approximately match the age, breed/size, and stage of disease at baseline as the ripasudil-treated eyes.Breeds were matched if possible and when not possible, the dogs were matched by body weight.Median time from the initial visit to meeting any of the progression criteria in historical controls was 223 days.Stage of disease at baseline was one factor found to be associated with a positive outcome, but additional investigation is necessary to determine other factors that may be predictive of an individual's response.

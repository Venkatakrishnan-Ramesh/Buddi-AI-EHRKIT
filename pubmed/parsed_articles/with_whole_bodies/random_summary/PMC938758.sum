L–type channels identification in pancreatic β-cells revealed that CCB inhibit TXNIP expression also in β–cells.TXNIP deficiency protects β cells against oxidative stress, glucose toxicity and apoptosis [2].Increased TXNIP-NLRP3 activation, nitrative stress and impaired vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2, VEGF-R2 activation are involved in high-fat diet-induced obesity that compromise vascular recovery in response to ischemic insult.Expression of TXNIP is induced by UV radiation, γ-radiation, high temperature, hypoxia, H2O2 and hyperglycemia.TXNIP deficiency prevents insulin resistance and diabetes type 2 [23].There are multiple interactions between thioredoxin–interacting protein and nitric oxide signalling.assessed the efficacy and safety of oral verapamil added for 12 months to a standard insulin regimen in adult patients with recent-onset of type 1 diabetes.In response to glucose, ChREBP dephosphorylates, translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus and binds to E-box repeat [35].Similar but less pronounced differences in fasting serum glucose levels were found for the all examined calcium channels blockers.The effect was dose–depended [40].Verapamil, a known inhibitor of calcium channels, also improved prediabetic neuropathy in the high-fat-diet-fed mice by inhibiting the upregulation of TXNIP.In mouse skeletal muscle with insulin receptor gene knockout, treatment with insulin failed to suppress TXNIP expression [15].Verapamil used as an additional drug or as a preferred drug in concomitant hypertension affects positively the diabetes treatment.

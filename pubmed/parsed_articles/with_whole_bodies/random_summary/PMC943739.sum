Optimized management of these high-impact technologies would contribute to their full implementation and cost reduction.An intervention study was conducted by developing and implementing a proprietary website (Farmastock).In order to speed up these exchanges, communications were made by email as soon as a request was made.These transfer systems had the necessary infrastructure to control traceability and maintain the necessary preservation conditions.The HIMs with a high risk of loss after a considerable period of immobilization on the Farmastock were offered to APHS hospitals outside the province of Cadiz, specifically to the Hospital Virgen Macarena and the Hospital Virgen del Rocio in the province of Seville (named as ‘others’ in Table 1).Incorporation and commitment of at least two professionals from each participating center.Offered medicines are medicines from one center that can be shared with another center where there are stock-outs.2.It is a platform for exchanging medicines between the Pharmacy services of 15 public hospitals in Castilla-La Mancha.The specialized HCDs are frequently used in a limited number of patients; therefore, the suspension of these treatments implies that the hospital has an immobilized stock without the possibility of use.In this second phase, we will consider adopting several critical recommendations from ASHP for the full implementation of Farmastock.

Circle indicates an approximately 20 mm osteochondral defect on the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle.Flexion can be used to relax the posterior soft tissues aiding in palpation of the posterior joint line.(CPN, Common peroneal nerve.).The knee can then be flexed/extended to determine the exact location of the joint line in preparation for posterior arthrotomy.After 6 weeks, gait training is initiated with progression to full and unrestricted walking without assistive devices or brace by 8 to 10 weeks.Range of motion is not initiated until the posterior wound has healed.

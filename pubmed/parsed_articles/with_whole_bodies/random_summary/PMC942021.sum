Essential oil of A. lavandulaefolia exhibited antiproliferative activity against HeLa cells by activating caspase 3 (9).In addition, the purification and structure elucidation of compounds responsible for cytotoxic effects of the most effective fraction were done.All samples were concentrated using a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure and temperature below 45°C.All samples and media were removed 48 h later.Polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) belong to flavonoid compounds with two or more methoxy groups in the structure, imposing anti-inflammatory and anticancer pharmacological effects.Eupatilin 7-methyl ether has shown moderate cytotoxic effects against Hep-G2, MCF-7, and HeLa cell lines with IC50 values of 28.3, 9.5, and 10.1 µg/mL, respectively (29).Scopoletin belongs to coumarin compounds and has been found in A. annua and A. incisa (45, 46).

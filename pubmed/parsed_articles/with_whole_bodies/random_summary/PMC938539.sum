Using demographic, clinical, visual field, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) variables to study the association of 5-year glaucomatous progression in glaucoma suspect eyes.This is a retrospective longitudinal clinical study.Logistic regression analysis showed that only PSD and severe inferior RNFL damage (i.e., red color) to be significantly associated with 5-year glaucomatous progression.Nassiri N, Das S, Patel V, et al.The significant factor in delaying vision loss due to glaucoma is its early diagnosis and treatment.8 The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found insufficient evidence on the advantages of early glaucoma screening.BCVA, best-corrected visual acuity; IOP, intraocular pressure; CCT, central corneal thickness; RNFL, retinal nerve fiber layer; C/D ratio, cup to disk ratio; MD, mean deviation; PSD, pattern standard deviation; SD, standard deviation; VFI: visual field index.The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to verify the normal distribution of the study outcomes.Compared to the eyes without progression, eyes with progression to glaucoma had statistically significantly worse MD (p = 0.02), higher PSD (p < 0.01) and less VFI (p < 0.01) at baseline (Table 1).We found severe inferior RNFL damage (i.e., red color) has a very high specificity of 96.72% Taliantzis et al.Our study has potential limitations.Due to the retrospective nature of the study, eyes participated in this study were diagnosed at the discretion of the attending physician.This may make it difficult to determine the true 5-year progression of glaucoma.

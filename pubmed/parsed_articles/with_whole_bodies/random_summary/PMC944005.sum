In poor neighborhoods, the lack of environmental hygiene is one of the factors that ensure the transmission of intestinal parasites.Intestinal parasitosis are a public health problem, affecting >2 billion people worldwide.It has been estimated that over three billion people worldwide are infested with intestinal parasites (Keiser and Utzinger, 2010).The city is divided in two parts by a small valley named “Metzinger valley”.Despite the low level of organization inthe area, each household was registered with a number on the administrative list.Exclusion criteria were the refusal of the legal tutor or an insufficient stool collection.Table 1Variables investigated during the study.Table 1Variables selected for the modelType de variableVariables selected for the modelType de variableGenderboolean / male reference (OD = 1)Agequantitative discreteClass of agediscreteEducational level of the motherboolean / “no education” reference (OD = 1)primaryboolean / “no education” reference (OD = 1)secondaryboolean / “no education” reference (OD = 1)high schoolboolean / “no education” reference (OD = 1)Quarter (Fokontany)boolean / “Manga” reference (OD = 1) or “other”weekly budget for foodquantitative continuous (logarythl)Latrine in the householdboolean / “no latrine” reference (OD = 1)Nbr of Inhabitants per roomquantitative continuousWeekly nbr of meals with meatquantitative continuouspoornessboolean / “lower quintile of reachness” reference (OD = 1)Treatment of waterboolean / “no treatment” reference (OD = 1).The variables investigated during the study as reported in Table 1 include information about the child (age, gender, weight, height, arm circumference, clinical symptoms) (UNICEF, 2021; WHO, 2006), the structure of the house and its environment (e.g., roof, walls, kitchen); the access to water and sanitation; the structure of the family; the education level of the parents and their profession.Not significant difference of prevalence was found between girls and boys (8.5% and 11.1% respectively), and no difference was observed according to the class of age.The educational level of mothers had a major impact on the prevalence of parasites in children.The model was also significant with p < 0.01 with a pseudo R2 at 4.3%.Although this parasite is not pathogenic, it is a very good indicator of the level of hygiene and insalubrity as already reported in other countries (Kouassi et al., 2019).In tropical countries, particularly in poor rural areas with fecal peril, the infestation can be massive and serious, especially in children.

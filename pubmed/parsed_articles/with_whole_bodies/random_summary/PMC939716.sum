The preference for vaccination for respondents was enhanced by increasing the efficacy and the duration of vaccine protection and decreasing complications and costs.In Iran, more than 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 128,000 deaths have been reported to date [3].The consequences of rationing include prioritizing services, effective resource allocation, and the effective management of resource distribution [13, 14].An example of these choice sets is given in Figs.All questionnaires were similar and differed only in choice sets, and each individual was given only one questionnaire.Data collection was performed both online (415 participants) and in person (300 participants) to increase generalizability by the research team members.In the in-person collection stage, the designed online questionnaire was completed according to individuals’ answers in public places (hospitals, government centers, public spaces) by the research team members using tablets.The conditional logit is one of the common estimation models used for statistical analysis [21–24].About 73% had a bachelor’s degree or higher, and over 47% were employed.About 90% of the subjects were covered by one of the health insurers.The odds ratio of having an underlying disease was 1.47, indicating that an individual with an underlying disease was more likely to be chosen to get the vaccine than a person without an underlying disease (Table 4).Table 4Conditional logit model of the public’s preferences for prioritizing receiving the coronavirus disease 2019 vaccineAttribute/levelCoefficientOdds ratioP-valueOdds ratio95%Confidence intervalAge (years) Less than 60Reference More than 60− 0.0580.9430.867–1.0250.171Underlying disease Not haveReference Have0.3881.4741.355–1.6020.000Employment in the health sector NoReference Yes0.5741.7771.635–1.9310.000Potential capacity to spread the virus (virus spread) Low (1–2 people)Reference Medium (3–5 people)0.4501.5681.397–1.7610.000 Many (5–10 people)0.9472.5782.280–2.9150.000The necessary job for society It is not necessary for societyReference It is necessary for society0.3961.4851.368–1.6130.000Cost to the community LowReference Medium0.1661.1801.053–1.3240.004 High0.5561.7451.555–1.9580.000N299Number of obs5962Prob > chi-square0.0000Log-likelihood− 1723.2727Pseudo R20.1660obs observations, Prob probability.The exchange between health, economy, and the health system is complicated, and the exact value of public opinion compared to the opinions of experts and politicians is unclear.

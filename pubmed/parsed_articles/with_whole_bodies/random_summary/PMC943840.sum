Although previous research has found that Hispanic women with polycystic ovary syndrome experience heightened hyperandrogenism and metabolic effects compared with non-Hispanic women, it is unknown whether they experience other polycystic ovary syndrome–related comorbidities, such as postpartum depression, to a greater degree than their non-Hispanic counterparts.This study aimed to determine the associations among a self-reported prepregnancy diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome symptoms (irregular menstruation, hirsutism, and acne), and postpartum depression among a national sample of at-risk women and evaluated the potential effect modification by Hispanic ethnicity.The study population included 52,267 postpartum (2–6 months) women who completed the US Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System Phase 8 questionnaire (2016–2018).The Utah study population was composed of 15.5% of women of Hispanic ethnicity, with 5.8% of Hispanic women and 7.4% of non-Hispanic women reporting prepregnancy polycystic ovary syndrome.PRAMS is conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction with state health departments.An informed consent document is included within each survey packet.Consent is implied if the survey is completed.15,16 Of note, 17 participating states (AK, CT, DE, HI, MD, ME, MI, MO, NJ, NY, OK, PA, UT, WI, WV, and Puerto Rico) included questions on the prepregnancy diagnosis of PCOS and postpartum depressive mood and anhedonia.A total of 52,267 women, reflecting an estimated population of 2,586,406 women, completed the PRAMS questionnaires 2016–2018 and were included in the current study.In our analysis, PCOS symptomology was primarily defined as having at least 2 symptoms: irregular periods and hirsutism or irregular periods and acne.Missing data for sociodemographic, health history, and lifestyle potential confounding factors were low (Table 1).Women with prepregnancy PCOS vs women without prepregnancy PCOS were more likely to be older, have higher BMI, be White and non-Hispanic, obtain higher education, and be married (Table 1).When considering symptom-based PCOS, 24.4% of women had 2 symptoms (irregular periods and hirsutism or irregular periods and acne), and 6.7% of women had all 3 symptoms (irregular period, hirsutism, and acne).Hispanic women had a slightly higher prevalence of irregular menstruation and a lower prevalence of acne and hirsutism (Figure 1) than non-Hispanic women.The agreement was fair with κ=0.20 (95% CI, 0.17–0.22) for 2 symptoms and κ=0.24 (95% CI, 0.20–0.29) for all 3 symptoms.Unadjusted PRs and aPRs for prepregnancy PCOS were similarly null in the Utah PRAMS cohort compared with the national PRAMS cohort (Table 3).In addition, women with PCOS symptoms, notably Hispanic women with PCOS symptoms, may be at increased risk of PPD even after accounting for several prepregnancy sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health history factors.Future population-based research wishing to assess comorbidities associated with PCOS should consider expanding PCOS classification beyond a clinical diagnosis to include symptom reporting by participants.20.Although this study was conducted using US data, the results were still relevant to women outside the United States, as they may serve to increase discussions between women and their healthcare providers about the importance of menstrual health concerning overall health.37.Compared with women without PPD, women with PPD may systematically differ in how they remember events or omit details in their answers.Another major limitation was that we could not infer causality between PPD and PCOS because of the cross-sectional nature of the data.

Health care leaders should consider SEMs for improving surgical backlog management in their local jurisdictions.2 In Canada, “elective” refers to any surgery that is scheduled in advance.Although less time sensitive than emergency procedures, many elective surgeries are nevertheless essential to prevent or delay death or disability.3,4 Before the pandemic, across Canada there were long elective surgery wait times, which were exacerbated as provincial governments instructed hospitals to pause elective procedures.5 In Ontario, elective surgeries were paused between March and May 2020 and then again between April and May 2021, to preserve capacity for patients with COVID-19.[male] and C.A.The current system, in which hospitals advocate and compete for surgeries, makes it difficult for stakeholders to collaborate.Others expressed that a single booking system might alleviate the administrative burden for physicians and administrators.However, all participants acknowledged that SEMs are vulnerable to the biases of their developers.10–14,16 Further, SEMs were originally developed and studied in western Canada.14,16 Some of our participants were involved in designing and implementing SEMs studied by other researchers.11,13.Although our participants spoke with authority given their experience and content expertise, we received less data directly from younger and more rural surgeons who would be directly affected by the implementation of an SEM in their jurisdiction.Given the small number of SEMs that have been developed in Ontario, the pool of local content experts was not large.Our participants and researchers are based in Ontario, and as such our findings should be considered in light of the province’s unique cultural and political context.Further research should incorporate the perspectives of patients and referring physicians.

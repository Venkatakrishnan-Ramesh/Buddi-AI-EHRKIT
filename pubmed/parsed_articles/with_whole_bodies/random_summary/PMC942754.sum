Recently, M2 macrophages have been reported to increase in proportion to the malignancy of glioma, and M2 macrophage infiltration has been shown as an indicator of malignancy [32].For immune-multiplex staining, a cocktail of primary antibodies, anti-Iba1, and anti-CD163 antibodies, was reacted overnight at room temperature.Reticular structures were identified near the border between the tumor and necrotic area in 2 of 16 cases (Fig.Therefore, it is considered to be the area that does not fit into any of the categories in Fig.The reticular formation we found in this study was positive for M2 macrophage markers CD163 and CD204, in addition for Cit-H3 (Fig.M2 macrophages are some of the aggravating factors in the tumor microenvironment, suppressing the inflammation and contributing to tumor growth, and have attracted much attention from the viewpoint of new cancer therapies.In other words, Iba1-positive and CD163- or CD204-negative can be regarded as M1 macrophages, and Iba1-positive and CD163- or CD204-positive as M2 macrophages.4a).In our previous studies, neutrophil-derived NETs were involved in many inflammatory diseases and tumors [31].

Significant predictors of surgical (vs. medical) treatment included essential hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 2.06 [1.01–4.18]), abscesses number (single vs. multiple, OR [95% CI] =4.81 [1.64–14.08]), midline shift (OR [95% CI] = 3.09 [1.22–7.82]).At 6 months, treatment failure cumulative incidence was 27.1% in the medical group (n = 31) and 21.3% in early surgical group (n = 22).PS entered this analysis as logit-transformed scores that were expanded using 3-knot restricted cubic splines to allow for nonlinear effects.Specifically, to test whether the early treatment effect varied according to how quickly surgery was performed after diagnosis (range 0–7 days), a semi-continuous dose-response scale was constructed based on the days since surgery at day 7 with an override for no early surgery (setting days to –1).As a second adjusted analysis but using all available patients, risk of 6-month failure from treatment type and relevant covariates was assessed using an extended Cox regression model in which the indicator for surgical treatment (at any time during follow-up) was incorporated as a time-dependent variable.Similarly, there was no difference in the prevalence of comorbid medical conditions and microbiologic characteristics between groups.Of note, a total of 20 (9%) patients reported ventriculitis on presentation.PS, propensity score.Demir et al.18 in 2007 proposed an imaging severity index (ISI) score for brain abscess, which included the number, location, the largest diameter of the abscess, presence of surrounding edema, and midline shift.MR.S.

Among the patients included in the study, 64% (n=6527) were men and 36% (n=3651) were women; 23% (n=2299) were Qataris and 77% (n=7879) were non-Qataris.Cardiovascular disease was a common comorbidity in patients with COVID-19 predecessors SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome.Every resident in Qatar is eligible to register with a PHCC health center for a nominal annual fee and utilize its services.Of these patients, 64% (n=6527) were men and 36% (n=3651) were women, 23% (n=2299) were Qatari and 77% (n=7879) were non-Qatari.Serum ferritin median and interquartile range 60 (18.6-209), c-reactive protein was 7.3 (2.9-17.8), 6.8 (6-8.1) for HbA1c, procalcitonin 0.09 (0.06-0.1), and NT pro-BNP 154.5 (12-297)TableÂ 3Laboratory Test Results Within 6 Months Before PresentationNumber of CasesMedianMeanSDSerum Ferritin4760123.8135.6CRP21307.316.929HbA1C1936.87.21.6Procalcitonin20.10.10.04NT pro-BNP2154.5154.5201.5Troponin- T-HS--------BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; CRP, c-reactive protein; HS, high sensitivity; SD, standard deviation.Multivariate analysis was used to predict the factor associated with inpatient admission among CVD cohort.There was no significant difference in hospital admission with respect to gender distribution and Qatari vs. non-Qatari patient population (odds ratio > 1).With respect to the association between comorbidities and hospital admission and complications, it was found that CVD patients with kidney disease have a higher risk of hospital admission as compared with other patients.

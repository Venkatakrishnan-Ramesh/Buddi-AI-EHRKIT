Clinical branches of medicine were found at a higher risk and younger HCWs or those with comorbidities had a higher severity of the disease.In the last 100 years, there have been four instances of global pandemics caused by the influenza virus; the current pandemic caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus of the coronavirus family is one of the deadliest.Only the 1918 flu pandemic (Spanish flu) pandemic, with a total death toll of approximately 50 million (500 lakh deaths), was deadlier than this COVID-19 pandemic.[2] Its efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease was 100% with an impact on reduction in hospitalizations.Fifty percent of our eligible population had been fully vaccinated as of December 10, 2021, whereas 80% has received at least one dose (1,31,18,87,257 doses).[6] The content validity index of the overall scale (S-CVI) is the proportion of individual items which had been given a rating of “very relevant” by all the experts involved.The doctors belonging to clinical branches had more severe diseases than pre/paraclinical medical professionals and other categories of HCWs (P = 0.0005).[26] Moreover, PPE compliance was protective in our study because approximately 60% of HCWs who got the breakthrough infection were not wearing PPE at the time of exposure.Strengths of the study include that the survey of breakthrough infection postvaccination was conducted on a nationwide level and included a large sample of all categories of HCWs to improve the generalizability of the study.Our study had certain limitations.Clinical branches were found to have a higher risk and those with comorbidities had higher severity of the disease.

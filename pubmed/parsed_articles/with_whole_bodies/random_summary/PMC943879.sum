Although we could not find valvular vegetation, he was clinically diagnosed with infective endocarditis according to the modified Duke’s criteria.Finally, ampicillin was selected based on drug susceptibility, and the patient was treated for 8 weeks and recovered without permanent damage.Further investigation is needed to clarify the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of S. argenteus infection, as there are few studies regarding this pathogen.Neck rigidity and jolt accentuation were not present.In the search of the etiology of multiple hemorrhages and infarction in the brain, repeated thorough physical examinations revealed a heart murmur in the mitral valve area and non-tender erythematous macules on the palms, fingers, toes, and soles recognized as Janeway lesions (Figure 2).MALDI-TOF MS (MALDI Biotyper ver.Although both TTE and transesophageal echocardiography could not detect valvular vegetations, the condition was diagnosed as IE based on the modified Duke’s criteria.14 The patient had met two major criteria (persistently positive blood cultures, defined as the first and last sample drawn 1 h apart, and emergence of cardiac murmur) in addition to three minor criteria (fever >38°C, evidence of vascular phenomena; Janeway lesions and intracranial hemorrhage, and findings suggestive of glomerulonephritis, hematuria, and proteinuria).He received 4 weeks of intravenous AMP, recovered without sequelae, and was discharged from our hospital on day 35 with oral ampicillin for two more weeks.Finally, the isolated strain from the blood cultures was confirmed as S. argenteus by NRPS gene PCR; the used primers were nrps-F (TTGARWCGACATTACCAGT) and nrps-R (ATWRCRTACATYTCRTTATC), as reported by Zhang et al.15 In addition, the isolated strain formed white (non-pigmented) colonies on mannitol salt agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company) incubated at 35°C in ambient air for 48 h (Figure 3A), which is characteristic of S. argenteus, as S. aureus forms gold-colored colonies (Figure 3B).Further investigation is needed to elucidate the epidemiology and clinical features, including what kinds of infections are more likely, and the ST of invasive infections due to S. argenteus.Physicians should be aware of this new strain that causes severe infections and has higher mortality than S. aureus, although it is difficult to identify S. argenteus by routine conventional tests and the old version of MALDI-TOF MS. Additionally, clinicians need to consider the possibility of IE when encountering cSAH in a febrile patient, as described in this case.

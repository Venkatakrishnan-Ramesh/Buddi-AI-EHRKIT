Due to their impact on healthcare systems, the sustainability and optimization of high-cost drugs is an issue of concern for several countries. Different strategies have been implemented such as centralized purchasing to optimize budgetary resources. However, there is still a need for a mechanism to optimize these drugs further.We conducted this prospective multicenter intervention study in five hospitals in the Andalusian Public Health System of Cádiz (Spain) between July 2019 and September 2021. We developed an online website (Farmastock) and implemented it to determine the availability of high-cost, low-use, and near-expiry medicines in each hospital. We used a simple analysis using operational variables to assess the project intervention's savings impact on managing these high-cost drugs.The implementation of Farmastock in Cádiz resulted in savings of 675,757.52 € for the Andalusian Public Health System, with 238 medicines transferred out of the 373 available. Of these medicines offered, the most considerable percentage were medicines used for pathologies with high clinical instability and accounted for nearly 80% of the medicines optimized by the tool.Farmastock allowed the Andalusian Public Health System to make substantial financial savings by not making new purchases of high-cost drugs available in other centers of this health network that were not being used. Therefore, this tool is a very efficient measure to contribute to the sustainability of the APHS and could be implemented in more hospitals soon.

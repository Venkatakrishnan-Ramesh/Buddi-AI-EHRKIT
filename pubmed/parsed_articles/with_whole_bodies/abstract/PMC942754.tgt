Macrophages are classified into two phenotypes, M1 and M2, based on their roles. M2 macrophages suppress inflammation and increase in proportion to the malignancy of brain tumors. Recently, macrophage extracellular traps (METs), which change into a network, have been reported as a unique form of macrophage cell death. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis of macrophages in METs in human glioblastoma was performed. To distinguish between M1 and M2 macrophages, multiple immunostainings with Iba1 combined with CD163 or CD204 were performed. M2 macrophages were present in small amounts in normal and borderline areas but showed an increasing trend as they shifted to tumor areas, and most of them were the activated- or phagocytic-type. We also successfully detected METs coexisting with fibrin and lactoferrin near the border between the tumor and necrotic area. M2 macrophages not only suppressed inflammation but also were involved in the formation of METs. This study found that M2 macrophages play various roles in unstable situations.

To review the published literature describing clinical outcomes of excisional goniotomy using the Kahook Dual Blade (KDB) for the management of glaucoma.A family of less invasive glaucoma procedures—including excisional goniotomy with the KDB—has been developed to provide moderate reductions in intraocular pressure and/or medication burden in eyes with therapeutic needs that may not warrant the risks associated with more traditional procedures such as trabeculectomy and tube-shunt implantation. This review's goal is to synthesize the existing literature into a compendium of excisional goniotomy's indications, technique, efficacy and safety outcomes, and optimal place in glaucoma management.Excisional goniotomy with the KDB effectively lowers IOP and reduces the medication burden in eyes with POAG and other forms of glaucoma across the spectrum of both baseline IOP and disease severity. The procedure exhibits a safety profile that is on par with other angle-based surgical interventions and enhanced safety compared to filtration procedures. It can be performed by comprehensive ophthalmologists as well as glaucoma specialists. This procedure as a standalone operation delivers IOP reductions consistent with filtration surgery, and in combination with cataract surgery delivers both IOP and medication reductions at least as great as other minimally invasive procedures.Given the broad base of evidence supporting its use in a wide variety of clinical scenarios, excisional goniotomy with the KDB can play a meaningful role in the achievement of patient-specific glaucoma therapy goals.These aggregate findings support the efficacy and safety of excisional goniotomy with the KDB and clarify the patient profiles best suited for this procedure.Dorairaj S, Radcliffe NM, Grover DS, et al.

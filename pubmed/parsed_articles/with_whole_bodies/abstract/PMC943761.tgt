Osteochondral allograft transplantation is a viable option for large chondral defects >2 cm squared, as well as in a revision setting after failure of a previous surface chondral restoration procedure. Osteochondral lesions involving the posterior aspect of the femoral condyle, however, are less common and easily underappreciated. Treatment of posterior osteochondral lesions is more technically demanding because they cannot be adequately addressed through standard arthroscopic approaches or an anterior arthrotomy. The challenges of the posterior approach include the relative unfamiliarity for many surgeons and the inherent risks due to the proximity of the neurovascular structures. The following technique reviews relevant anatomy and approach to osteochondral allograft transplant involving the posterior femoral condyles.

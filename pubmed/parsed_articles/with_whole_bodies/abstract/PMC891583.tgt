The modulation of growth hormone secretagogue receptor-1a (GHSR1a) signaling is a promising strategy for treating brain conditions of metabolism, aging, and addiction. GHSR1a activation results in pleiotropic physiological outcomes through distinct and pharmacologically separable G protein– and β-arrestin (βarr)–dependent signaling pathways. Thus, pathway-selective modulation can enable improved pharmacotherapeutics that can promote therapeutic efficacy while mitigating side effects. Here, we describe the discovery of a brain-penetrant small molecule, N8279 (NCATS-SM8864), that biases GHSR1a conformations toward Gαq activation and reduces aberrant dopaminergic behavior in mice. N8279 represents a promising chemical scaffold to advance the development of better treatments for GHSR1a-related brain disorders involving the pathological dysregulation of dopamine.

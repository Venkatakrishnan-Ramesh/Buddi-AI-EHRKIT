Renal cryoablation (CA) has become an accepted treatment option for patients with small renal tumors and co-morbidities that make them less favorable for surgical intervention. Complications from renal CA have been previously reported and are generally associated with increasing size and central location of the tumor. Ureteral injury from renal CA, although rare, can be difficult to manage and may require complex surgeries in patients who are poor surgical candidates to begin with. We report a case of a renal mass CA complicated by proximal ureteral necrosis and transection, treated with multiple minimally invasive procedures ultimately resulting in successful bridging of the necrotic segment with nephroureteral stent and thus avoiding major surgery.

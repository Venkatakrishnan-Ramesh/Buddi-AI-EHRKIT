Cytotoxic activity of crude extract and fractions (petroleum ether, dichloromethane, and n-butanol) of Artemisia haussknechtii aerial parts was investigated by MTT assay. Dichloromethane fraction showed the highest cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cell line (IC50 = 297.17 ± 7.99 µg/mL). Phytochemical analysis of the most effective fraction was carried out using normal phase column chromatography (CC) to get eight sub-fractions (A-H). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used for further purification. Four known compounds with cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines were isolated from the most active fraction, including 5-Hydroxy-3',4',6,7-tetramethoxyflavone (eupatilin 7-methyl ether), 5-hydroxy 3,3',4',6,7-pentamethoxy-flavone (artemetin), 6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin (scopoletin), and methyl caffeate. Structure elucidation of isolated compounds was done using spectroscopic techniques, including ESIMS and 1D-NMR (1H and 13C). Cytotoxic activity of A. haussknechtii is probably due to coumarin and flavonoid compounds.

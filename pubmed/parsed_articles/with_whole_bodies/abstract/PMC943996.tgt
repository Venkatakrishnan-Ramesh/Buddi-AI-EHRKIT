Current treatment options for high-risk patients with severe carotid artery stenosis include transcarotid artery revascularization, transfemoral carotid artery stenting, and carotid endarterectomy. Transfemoral carotid artery stenting is associated with high perioperative stroke risk, and recent studies and trials have identified transcarotid artery revascularization as a new technique able to minimize the stroke risk associated with high-risk procedures. Moreover, the transcervical approach allows easy access to the carotid artery in cases with an anatomically tortuous aortic arch. Therefore, determining the optimal approach to achieve arterial access during carotid stenting is important for successful procedures and positive outcomes. We report a clinical case of ischemic stroke due to severe stenosis of the left internal carotid artery indicated for stent deployment. After transfemoral carotid artery stenting failure, the patient's symptoms progressed from minor stroke to hemiplegia and Broca's aphasia. The transcervical approach was used to perform transcarotid artery revascularization after several days. The procedure was both safe and prevented recurrent stroke occurrence. Although transfemoral access is the classic approach used for carotid stenting, the transcervical approach can be used as an alternative and safe choice in cases with complex vascular anatomy, such as the one described here.

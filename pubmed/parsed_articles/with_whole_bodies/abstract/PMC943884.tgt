Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related stress is an important but under-rated issue needing attention. Stress and causative factors vary between the regions and individuals depending on the availability of resources, socio-cultural differences, and individual perceptions. We aimed to study the psychosocial impact and coping strategies among the healthcare workers (HCWs) in Western Rajasthan during COVID-19 pandemic.This questionnaire-based observational study, consisting of 59 questions in 6 sections, was conducted to identify stress, causative factors, coping strategies, and experiences of HCWs working in personal protective equipment (PPE). Chi-square test was used to compare the responses between different subgroups.Majority of the HCWs felt responsible for treating COVID-19 patients (98.8%), but also felt that it was affecting their safety (81.4%). On subgroup analysis, doctors were found to be more stressed than nursing staff (P = 0.004). Major stressors included concerns about infecting family members and lack of specific treatment for COVID-19 (87.5%). Family support was found to be a major stress-relieving factor (97.3%). Most HCWs suggested that comfortable quarantine stay, adequate supply of PPE, and equipments would help in reducing stress.Frontline HCWs in Western Rajasthan were under significant stress during COVID-19 pandemic. We found that stress-causing factors and coping strategies varied between different subgroups based on profession, gender, and age. We recommend conducting such studies in different regions of the world to develop relevant and region-specific strategies to help HCWs cope with stress more efficiently, thereby, strengthening the healthcare system to deal with future pandemics.

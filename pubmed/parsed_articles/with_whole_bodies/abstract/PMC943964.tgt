Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy disease that causes cupping of the optic disc and decreased visual field. Glaucoma is still the second leading cause of blindness globally, with a worldwide prevalence of more than 76 million people in 2020. However, no therapy can cure glaucoma completely, especially when optic nerve damage has occurred. Available treatments only play a role in keeping the intraocular pressure stable This research aims to determine the potential use of modified stem cell therapy to treat intraocular damage in glaucoma cases. Literature research was conducted by involving seven online databases, namely Pubmed, ScienceDirect®, Proquest, EBSCOhost®, SAGE®, Clinicalkey®, and Scopus, published between 2010–2020 with the keywords stem cells; therapy; glaucoma; optic nerve. Six articles were selected, and out of the six articles, all writings were experimental research. The entire literature states that modified stem cell therapy has the potential as a therapeutic option in treating intraocular damage in patients with glaucoma. Based on the systematic literature review that has been carried out, it is known that stem cell therapy has the potential to be a therapeutic option in treating glaucoma cases. Much more research is needed to assess the effectiveness of modified stem cell therapy in managing intraocular damage due to glaucoma.

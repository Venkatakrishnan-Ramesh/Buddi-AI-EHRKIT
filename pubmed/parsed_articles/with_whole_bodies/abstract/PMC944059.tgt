By their capacity to induce peripheral T cell tolerance, dendritic cells (DCs) present a promising target cell and therapeutic strategy for treatment of several autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS). This protocol describes how to determine the tolerogenic capacities of DCs in the context of the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We provide a step-by-step instruction for EAE induction, antigen-loaded bone-marrow-derived-DC (BM-DC) generation, adoptive cell transfer, and analysis of DC-mediated changes in regulatory T cell populations.

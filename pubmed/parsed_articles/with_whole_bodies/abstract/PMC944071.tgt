Effective theranostic of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in an early-stage is imminently demanded to improve its poor prognosis. Combination of the near-infrared (NIR) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) can provide high temporospatial resolution, outstanding optical contrast, and deep penetration and thus is promising for accurate and sensitive HCC diagnosis.A versatile CXCR4-targeted Indocyanine green (ICG)/Platinum (Pt)-doped polydopamine melanin-mimic nanoparticle (designated ICG/Pt@PDA-CXCR4, referred to as IPP-c) is synthesized as an HCC-specific contrast agent for high-resolution precise diagnostic PAI/FLI and optical imaging-guided targeted photothermal therapy (PTT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) of orthotopic small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC).The multifunctional targeted nanoparticle yields superior HCC specificity, high imaging contrast in both PAI and FLI, good stability, reliable biocompatibility, effective singlet oxygen generation and superior photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE, 58.7%) upon 808-nm laser irradiation. The targeting ability of IPP-c was validated in in vitro experiments on selectively killing the CXCR4-overexpressing HCC cells. Moreover, we test the efficient dual-modal optical precision diagnosis properties of IPP-c via in vivo experiments on targeted particle accumulation in an early-stage SHCC mouse model (tumor diameter about 1.2 mm). Then, under the guidance of real-time optical imaging, effective and mini-invasive PTT/PDT of orthotopic SHCCs were demonstrated without damaging adjacent liver tissues or other major organs.This study presented a multifunctional CXCR4-targeted nanoparticle to conduct effective and mini-invasive phototherapeutics of orthotopic SHCCs via the real-time quantitative guidance by optical imaging, which provided a new perception for building a versatile targeted nanoplatform for phototheranostics of early-stage HCC.

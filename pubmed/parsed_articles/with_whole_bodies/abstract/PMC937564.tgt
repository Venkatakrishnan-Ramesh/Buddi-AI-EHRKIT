The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a major public health problem. Virus entry occurs via binding to ACE2. Five SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) were reported so far, all having immune escape characteristics. Infection with the current VOC Omicron was noticed in immunized and recovered individuals; therefore, the development of new treatments against VOC infections is urgently needed. Most approved mAbs treatments against SARS-CoV-2 are directed against the spike protein of the original virus and are therefore inefficient against Omicron. Here, we report on the generation of hACE2.16, an anti-ACE2 antibody that recognizes and blocks ACE2-RBD binding without affecting ACE2 enzymatic activity. We demonstrate that hACE2.16 binding to ACE2 does not affect its surface expression and that hACE2.16 blocks infection and virus production of various VOCs including Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. hACE2.16 might, therefore, be an efficient treatment against all VOCs, the current and probably also future ones.

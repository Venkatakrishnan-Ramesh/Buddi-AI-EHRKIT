Acutely, pain serves to protect us from potentially harmful stimuli, however damage to the somatosensory system can cause maladaptive changes in neurons leading to chronic pain. Although acute pain is fairly well controlled, chronic pain remains difficult to treat. Chronic pain is primarily a neuropathic condition, but studies examining the mechanisms underlying chronic pain are now looking beyond afferent nerve lesions and exploring new receptor targets, immune cells, and the role of the autonomic nervous system in contributing chronic pain conditions. The studies outlined in this review reveal how chronic pain is not only confined to alterations in the nervous system and presents findings on new treatment targets and for this debilitating disease.

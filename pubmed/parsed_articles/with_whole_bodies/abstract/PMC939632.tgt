Iron overload can contribute to the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hepcidin (Hamp), which is primarily synthesized in hepatocytes, is a key regulator of iron metabolism. However, the role of Hamp in NASH remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the role of Hamp in the pathophysiology of NASH.Male mice were fed a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet for 16 weeks to establish the mouse NASH model. A choline-supplemented amino acid-defined (CSAA) diet was used as the control diet. Recombinant adeno-associated virus genome 2 serotype 8 vector expressing Hamp (rAAV2/8-Hamp) or its negative control (rAAV2/8-NC) was administered intravenously at week 8 of either the CDAA or CSAA diet.rAAV2/8-Hamp treatment markedly decreased liver weight and improved hepatic steatosis in the CDAA-fed mice, accompanied by changes in lipogenesis-related genes and adiponectin expression. Compared with the control group, rAAV2/8-Hamp therapy attenuated liver damage, with mice exhibiting reduced histological NAFLD inflammation and fibrosis, as well as lower levels of liver enzymes. Moreover, Î±-smooth muscle actin-positive activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and CD68-postive macrophages increased in number in the CDAA-fed mice, which was reversed by rAAV2/8-Hamp treatment. Consistent with the in vivo findings, overexpression of Hamp increased adiponectin expression in hepatocytes and Hamp treatment inhibited HSC activation.Overexpression of Hamp using rAAV2/8-Hamp robustly attenuated liver steatohepatitis, inflammation, and fibrosis in an animal model of NASH, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for Hamp.

Massive rotator cuff tears are a common issue for patients and can be challenging to manage surgically. While the literature has shown that repair construct can affect the outcome of a rotator cuff repair, and the double-row repair is typically favored over the single-row repair for larger rotator cuff tears, the double-row repair also has some shortcomings. These shortcomings are related to the increased technical difficulty of the procedure, as well as increased costs due to the increased number of anchors used. Both of these factors also lead to an increase in the amount of time spent in the operating room as well. This study describes a surgical technique to help mitigate this shortcoming of the double-row repair by using a single medial-row anchor in our double-row construct for repair of a massive rotator cuff tear.

Surface engineering of halide perovskites (HaPs), semiconductors with amazing optoelectronic properties, is critical to improve the performance and ambient stability of HaP-based solar cells and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Ultrathin layers of two-dimensional (2D) analogs of the three-dimensional (3D) HaPs are particularly attractive for this because of their chemical similarities but higher ambient stability. But do such 2D/3D interfaces actually last, given that ions in HaPs move readilyâ€”i.e., what happens at those interfaces on the atomic scale? A special electron microscopy, which as a bonus also reveals the true conditions for nondestructive analysis, shows that the large ions that are a necessary part of the 2D films can move into the 3D HaP, a fascinating illustration of panta rei in HaPs.

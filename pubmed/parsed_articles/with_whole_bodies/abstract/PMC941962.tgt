The statistical population consisted of all students at Iran University of Medical Sciences, among whom, 389 samples were recruited. Two questionnaires were used: (1) Media Literacy and (2) Willingness to be Vaccinated. The validity of these questionnaires was confirmed by the content validity method and consultation with experts. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation, t test, and one-way analysis of variance using SPSS v. 20 (SPSS Inc).The willingness to be vaccinated was higher in men (23.04 ± 5.59) than in women (21.07 ± 3.77) and this difference was significant (P<.001). However, there was no significant difference between willingness to be vaccinated and marital status, educational level, and age. The findings showed a significant relationship between media literacy and willingness to be vaccinated.The effect of media literacy on retrieving and recognizing accurate information is one of the crucial results of the present study.

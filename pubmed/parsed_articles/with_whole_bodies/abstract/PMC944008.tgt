•Ultrasonic melt processing + Al-Ti-B have the best grain refinement effect.•The size of Fe-rich phase in ultrasonic + Al-Ti-B is smaller than conventional methods.•Ultrasonic + Al-Ti-B improve the nucleation temperature of α-Al and Fe-rich phases.•The solidification reactions under different conditions are estabilished.

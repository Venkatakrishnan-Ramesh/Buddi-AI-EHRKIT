The malfunction of junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C) has been reported to induce congenital cataract in humans and mice; however, specific characters and the mechanism of this cataract are still unclear. This study aimed to characterize abnormal lens development in Jamc knockout mice and clarify the underlying mechanism.Jamc knockout mice backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 genetic background were used for this research. Slit-lamp and darkfield images showed the cataract phenotype of Jamc−/− mice. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to visualize the morphological and histological features. RNA sequencing was applied to detect differentially expressed genes. Quantitative RT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence were used to determine the level of unfolded protein response (UPR)-related genes. TUNEL staining was utilized to label cell death.Jamc knockout mice exhibited nuclear cataract with abnormal lens morphology and defective degradation of nuclei and organelles in lens fiber cells. Compared with wild-type control mice, the expression level of BiP, CHOP, TRIB3, and CHAC1, genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress and the UPR, were highly upregulated in Jamc−/− lenses, suggesting that abnormal lens development was accompanied by UPR activation. Moreover, increased cell death was also found in Jamc−/− lenses.Congenital nuclear cataract caused by Jamc deficiency is accompanied by defective degradation of nuclei and organelles in lens fiber cells, lens structure disorder, and UPR activation, suggesting that JAM-C is required for maintaining normal lens development and that UPR activation is involved in cataract formation in Jamc-deficient lenses.

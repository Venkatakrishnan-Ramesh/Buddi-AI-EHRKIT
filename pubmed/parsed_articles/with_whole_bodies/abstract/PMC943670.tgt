Reporting and understanding patient safety incidents is a cornerstone of improving patient care quality and safety. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education specifically mandates that physician trainee education include participation in the recognition, reporting, and root cause analysis of patient safety incidents. Studies on safety event reporting, however, have consistently shown that attending physicians submit few safety reports, and trainees submit even fewer. We undertook a study to assess the rate at which pathology trainees report patient safety events relative to the rates at which trainees in other medical specialties do. We performed a retrospective analysis of 13,722 safety reports submitted to our medium-sized Academic Medical Centerâ€™s incident reporting system. We then analyzed those reported by trainees (residents and fellows), and then further drilled down on the subset of trainee-reported safety events reported by pathology trainees. Despite accounting for over 5% of all types of trainees at the enterprise level, pathology trainees accounted for only 0.5% of all trainee safety reports. Our findings represent a call to action for pathology training programs to engage their residents and fellows in quality and safety initiatives, to understand and remove barriers to safety event reporting for vulnerable populations such as trainees, and to empower trainees to confidently report safety risks as valued frontline care providers.

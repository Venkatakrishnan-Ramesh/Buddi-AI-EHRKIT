Benign retrosternal thyroid goiters can become large enough to compress the trachea and result in tracheomalacia and stenosis. This retrospective study from a single surgical center aimed to study the surgical management of 48 patients with retrosternal goiter and tracheal stenosis diagnosed and treated from January 2017 to December 2021.All preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scans showed retrosternal goiter and tracheal stenosis. RG was classified into type I in 28 patients, type II in 12 patients, and type III in 8 patients. TS was classified into grade I in 31 patients, grade II in 11 patients, and grade III in 6 patients. All patients were referred for surgery. Clinicopathologic features and surgical outcomes were recorded.All operations were successfully performed. There were 41 patients with transcervical incision, 4 with cervical incision+sternotomy, 2 with cervical incision and thoracoscopic surgery, and 1 with cervical incision and surgery via the subxiphoid approach. Two patients presented recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. One patient showed short-term hand and foot numbness. The patients were pathologically diagnosed as simple nodular goiter (n=27), nodular goiter combined with cystic change (n=6), adenomatous nodular goiter (n=10), and thyroid adenoma (n=5). There was no prominent tumor recurrence or gradual TS remission.This study has highlighted that patients with retrosternal goiter and tracheal stenosis may have comorbidities and require a multidisciplinary approach to management. The choice of anesthesia, surgical approach, and maintenance of the airway during and after surgery should be individualized.

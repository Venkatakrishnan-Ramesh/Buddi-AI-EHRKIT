Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a well-known complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Diabetic ketoacidosis predisposes patients into devastating neurological complications. The most common neurologic complication is cerebral edema. Stroke either ischemic or hemorrhagic are uncommon complications of DKA with worse patient's outcome. Hemorrhagic stroke can manifest as subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. We present a 14-year-girl presented with DKA and complicated with both subarachnoid and intraparenchymal hemorrhages. Owing to early diagnosis and prompt treatment the patient had good outcome.

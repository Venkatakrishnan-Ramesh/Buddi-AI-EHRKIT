This study was performed to investigate whether social support and other psychological predictors were associated with physical activity during the prolonged social isolation due to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in Iran.This cross-sectional study was performed on 494 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a diabetes specialty clinic. The questionnaire package comprised five parts, including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, physical activity level, diabetes-specific social support, feelings of isolation, and diabetes-related distress. Clinical and hemoglobin A1c data were obtained from electronic medical records. Descriptive statistics, Pearsonâ€™s chi-square test, and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to analyze the data.Approximately 71% of the participants participated in low/insufficient levels of physical activity. The participants who received support from family/friends (odds ratio [OR] = 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47 - 2.74), diabetes care team (OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.15 - 1.77), and neighbors (OR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.20 - 2.08) were more likely to have sufficient physical activity than those who did not receive these supports. There was also an association between physical activity behavior with feelings of isolation and diabetes distress.This study points to the importance of social support as an amplifier mechanism for the maintenance of physical activity behavior in individuals with T2D during critical times.

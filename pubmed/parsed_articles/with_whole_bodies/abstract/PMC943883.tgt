Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected postgraduate medical education, training, and ongoing research work across specialties. Our survey aimed to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on challenges in pursuing research and academics and ascertain the stressors on residents across medical specialties.The questionnaire was validated by 10 experts and following ethical approval, this google form-based survey was circulated to postgraduates across specialties across the country through social media platforms over 1 month (22 August 2020 to 21 September 2020). On clicking the link, the participants received brief information regarding the survey followed by the questionnaire. Weekly reminders were sent to the nonresponders till the desired sample size was attained, after which the survey was closed, and responses were analyzed.Four hundred and nineteen of 900 residents completed the survey (46.6% response rate). Majority (88.8%) admitted that the inability to conduct the thesis and break in academics caused a significant amount of mental stress upon them. Though classes had resumed through online platforms for most residents (75.4%), the residents reported that lack of bedside learning (65.4%), inadequate progress tests (26.4%), and delay in thesis topic allotment (84.6% among those not allotted thesis) correlated with increased stress. Fear of extension of the course (53%; P = 0.019) and getting infected with COVID-19 (46.6%; P = 0.019) were most cited reasons for significant stress in most of the residents. Many residents (26%) were unable to sleep properly and 22.1% were unable to concentrate on academics. Majority believed that extension of the submission deadline, reduction in sample size, and change in topic would help to complete thesis.The present survey revealed that there is a major impediment to research and academics of medical postgraduates during COVID-19 pandemic which has markedly increased their stress levels.

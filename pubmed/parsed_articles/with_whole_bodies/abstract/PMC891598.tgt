While most small, regulatory RNAs are thought to be “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe a 164-nucleotide RNA that encodes a 28-amino acid, amphipathic protein, which interacts with aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and increases dehydrogenase activity but also base pairs with two mRNAs to reduce expression. The coding and base-pairing sequences overlap, and the two regulatory functions compete.

To compare TearCare and Lipiflow systems in the ability to reduce the symptoms of dry eye disease (DED) associated with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD).In this multicenter, masked, randomized-controlled trial, 235 subjects received a single TearCare treatment (n = 115) or a single LipiFlow treatment (n = 120) and were followed for 1-month post-treatment. DED symptoms were assessed using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE), and Eye Dryness (ED) questionnaires at baseline and at 1 month. Post-hoc subgroup analysis was conducted on subjects with less severe and more severe gland obstruction determined by baseline meibomian gland secretion score (MGSS).TearCare system significantly improved total OSDI, SANDE, and ED scores from baseline (p < 0.0001) at 1-month follow-up. Subjects with more severe disease (MGSS <7) achieved statistically greater reduction with TearCare compared to LipiFlow in total OSDI score (30.4 ± 2.53 and 21.9 ± 2.37, respectively, pANCOVA = 0.0160), OSDI Section B score for quality of vision (5.1 ± 0.48 and 3.6 ± 0.45, respectively, pANCOVA= 0.0206), and SANDE frequency score (51.9 ± 3.70 and 41.5 ± 3.45, respectively, pANCOVA = 0.0455).TearCare provides significant DED symptom relief at 1 month after a single treatment. Outcomes were consistent in OSDI, SANDE, and ED assessments. In subjects with more severe gland dysfunction, TearCare performed significantly better than LipiFlow in improving quality of vision and overall DED symptom frequency determined by OSDI and SANDE.

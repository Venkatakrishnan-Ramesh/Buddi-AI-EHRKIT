The main principle of the present medial collateral ligament reconstruction technique is to address anteromedial knee instability. Therefore, we describe a gracilis tenodesis with 2 functional bundles to reconstruct the deep and superficial medial collateral ligament. The proposed technique may be performed as an isolated or combined procedure with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Valgus instability in extension is a contraindication.

Intramuscular lipoma is a rare soft-tissue tumor with an overall incidence of less than 1% of all lipomas. It primarily occurs in the trunk and proximal parts of the upper and lower extremities. Intramuscular lipoma of the soleus muscle has not been reported before in the English literature and the best treatment option is not known. The purpose of this Technical Note is to describe the details of endoscopically assisted resection of intramuscular lipoma of the soleus. This is indicated for well demarcated intramuscular lipoma of the soleus and is contraindicated in infiltrating intramuscular lipoma. Besides the advantage of minimally invasive surgery, this endoscopic technique allows en bloc resection of the intramuscular lipoma.

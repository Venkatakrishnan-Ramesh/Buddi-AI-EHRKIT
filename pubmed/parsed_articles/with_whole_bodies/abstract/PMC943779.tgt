This literature review examines the need to develop appropriate policies specific to the oral health needs of older people that are individualised, cost-effective, and sustainable. Poor oral health and impaired oral function negatively affect the health and quality of life of older adults. Developing care systems that aim to meet patientsâ€™ normative needs as well as their perceived needs and expectations is one factor in successful delivery of appropriate dental care. Cost is another significant driver of utilisation, and many older adults worldwide lack adequate resources for dental care. Failure to address these issues results in poor outcomes and increased costs of dental and medical care. Disease prevention and control at early stages can preserve public and private financial resources as well as quality of life and well-being for older adults at any stage of life.

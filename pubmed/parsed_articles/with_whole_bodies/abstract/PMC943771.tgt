Excessive posterior tibial slope (PTS) is a recognized risk factor for failure of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and should be considered when planning a revision ACLR. A tibial supra-tubercular deflexion osteotomy can correct excessive PTS with simultaneous or staged ACLR. There are only a handful of technical descriptions offering insight on the respective authors’ approach at reducing PTS, all of which vary greatly in their methods. The authors describe a surgical technique using a proximal tibial supra-tubercular deflexion osteotomy in patients with persistent knee instability, a history of at least one failed ACLR, and a PTS greater than 12°. This surgery is not recommended in patients with significant genu recurvatum (>10°), significant varus, or severe tibiofemoral osteoarthritis.

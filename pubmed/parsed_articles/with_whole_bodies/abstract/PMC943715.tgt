Brachytherapy is widely used for the treatment of choroidal melanoma and has recently been explored for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration. We propose the use of low dose radiation via episcleral brachytherapy in refractory cases of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). The pathogenesis of CSCR involves dilatation and hyperpermeability of large choroidal vessels. Low dose radiation can induce intimal proliferation in large choroidal vessels and decrease their hyperpermeability. Concerns about the use of brachytherapy in CSCR include damage to the choriocapillaris or the retinal vessels. This can be addressed with the use of a specialized device through which a very precise and appropriate dose can be delivered. The dose of the radiation delivered decreases exponentially at a depth of approximately 0.5–1.5 mm from the devise–sclera interface. Considering an increased choroidal thickness in cases of CSCR, delivery of a safe dose can be assured.

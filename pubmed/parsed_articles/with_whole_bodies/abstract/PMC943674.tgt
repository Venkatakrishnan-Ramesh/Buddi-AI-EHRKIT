The human brain consumes five orders of magnitude more energy than the sun by unit of mass and time. This staggering bioenergetic cost serves mostly synaptic transmission and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The peak of both brain bioenergetic demands and the age of onset for neurodevelopmental disorders is approximately 5 years of age. This correlation suggests that defects in the machinery that provides cellular energy would be causative and/or consequence of neurodevelopmental disorders. We explore this hypothesis from the perspective of the machinery required for the synthesis of the electron transport chain, an ATP-producing and NADH-consuming enzymatic cascade. The electron transport chain is constituted by nuclear- and mitochondrial-genome-encoded subunits. These subunits are synthesized by the 80S and the 55S ribosomes, which are segregated to the cytoplasm and the mitochondrial matrix, correspondingly. Mitochondrial protein synthesis by the 55S ribosome is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of electron transport chain components, suggesting that mitochondrial protein synthesis is a bottleneck for tissues with high bionergetic demands. We discuss genetic defects in the human nuclear and mitochondrial genomes that affect these protein synthesis machineries and cause a phenotypic spectrum spanning autism spectrum disorders to neurodegeneration during neurodevelopment. We propose that dysregulated mitochondrial protein synthesis is a chief, yet understudied, causative mechanism of neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders.

Retroperitoneal liposarcomas are diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to their expansive growth and tendency for recurrence. They represent the most of the sarcomas of the retroperitoneal space with the incidence of 41%. Most of them can grow in large proportions before symptom occurrence and change the anatomy of the retroperitoneum. Computerized tomography remains the main diagnostic tool in such cases that provides precise tumor location, size and relation to the adjacent organs. Surgery is the method of choice for treatment. Nevertheless, they tend to recur in 50%-80% of patients despite the appropriate surgery. We present a case of giant retroperitoneal liposarcoma in a female patient with significant left kidney displacement that recurred within 5 years of its removal.

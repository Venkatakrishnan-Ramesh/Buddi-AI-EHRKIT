The knee unloader brace can change loading on knee which may be effective in reducing symptoms and progression of disease in people with knee osteoarthritis.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a new knee brace during walking in a patient with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.Two brace types were used: new brace and conventional brace. A pneumatic cuff of novel brace was fitted in the bottom of the medical slipper that wasconnected to the cuff section of the knee through the tube. After the knee brace is deployed, its force can vary in different stages of the gait.During the heel strike, the weight of the cuff is compressed on the floor, causing the air to flow inside it and entering the volume of air into the knee pad.The results of using this pneumatic knee brace compared with conventional knee braces on a patient showed that in both cases, the openand closed palatal pump, the adduction moment and ROM was decreased in the stance phase. But the three-point knee pressure, however,was less effective in reducing the adduction moment but also reduced the knee ROM. Using novel brace can eliminate the patientâ€™s need for painful and

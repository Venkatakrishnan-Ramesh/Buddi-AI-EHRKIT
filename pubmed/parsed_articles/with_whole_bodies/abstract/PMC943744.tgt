Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction is the most common operation for treating patellofemoral joint instability. Accurately identifying the fluoroscopic location of the MPFL anatomical insertion point is critical in this procedure. However, current radiographic localization has some limitations, such as inaccuracy and radiation exposure. We recommend a simpler and more accurate instrument for intraoperative fluoroscopic positioning.

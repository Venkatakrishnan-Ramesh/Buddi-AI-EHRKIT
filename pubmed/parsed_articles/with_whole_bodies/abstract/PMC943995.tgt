Eccrine poroma is a rare adult benign adnexal tumor that originates in the excretory pore of the sweat gland. It is a small reddish lesion, protuberant, fleshy, and well-defined. It is located preferably in the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet [1]. Nevertheless, it may be found on any skin part of the body's surface [2]. We report a case of eccrine poroma of relatively rare localization on the second toe of the left foot. The biopsy confirmed the diagnosis by objectifying the histological lesions corresponding with the poroma. The article aims to report an eccrine poroma located in an unusual location, surgical treatment, and follow-up.

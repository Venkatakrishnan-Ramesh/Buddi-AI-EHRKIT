Surgery at the cervicomedullary junction carries a risk of damaging vital brainstem functions. Because the nucleus of the solitary tract (NS) is involved in the baroreceptor reflex, damage to its integrity may lead to orthostatic hypotension.A 56-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and previous bilateral adrenalectomy due to pheochromocytoma was referred with symptoms of dysphagia and paralysis of the left vocal cord. Paralysis of the left vagus nerve was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a contrast-enhancing cystic process in the cervicomedullary junction. Twenty-three years earlier, the patient had undergone surgical treatment for a hemangioblastoma in the same region. After repeated surgery, the patient temporarily developed orthostatic hypotension. At discharge, the patient no longer needed antihypertensive medication.

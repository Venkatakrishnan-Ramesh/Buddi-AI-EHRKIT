Abstract: In anticipation of a phylogenetically revised monograph of Entoloma in Europe, six new species of subgenus Cyanula are described here. Entoloma cistocruentatum is associated with Cistus in Spain, E. dislocatum occurs in montane regions in Catalonia (Spain) and Tuscany (Italy), E. indikon is known from Denmark and three species are mainly distributed in the Nordic countries in Europe: E. calceus, E. perchalybeum and E. praecipuum. Entoloma incarnatofuscescens, from the /Rusticoides clade is neotypified. A fully amended description is given based on molecular evidence, which includes the recently described E. violaceoparkensis and E. klofacianum which became later synonyms.Citation: Noordeloos ME, Vila J, Jordal JB, Kehlet T, Brandrud TE, Bendiksen E, Moreau P-A, Dondl M, Lor√•s J, Larsson E, Dima B (2022).

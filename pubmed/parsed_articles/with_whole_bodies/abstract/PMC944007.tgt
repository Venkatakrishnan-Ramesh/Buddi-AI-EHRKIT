Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of primary brain tumor. Although numerous postoperative therapeutic strategies have already been developed, including radiotherapy, tumors inevitably recur after several years of treatment. The coinhibitory molecule B7–H4 negatively regulates T cell immune responses and promotes immune escape. Exosomes mediate intercellular communication and initiate immune evasion in the tumor microenvironment (TME).This study aimed to determine whether B7–H4 is upregulated by radiation and loaded into exosomes, thus contributing to immunosuppression and enhancing tumor growth.Iodixanol density-gradient centrifugation and flow cytometry were used to verify exosomal B7–H4. Naïve T cells were differentiated into Th1 cells, with or without exosomes. T cell-secreted cytokines and markers of T cell subsets were measured. Mechanistically, the roles of B7–H4, and ALIX in GBM were analyzed using databases and tissue samples. Co‐immunoprecipitation, and pull-down assays were used to tested the direct interactions between ATM and ALIX or STAT3. In vitro ATM kinase assays, western blotting, and site-directed mutation were used to assess ATM-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation. Finally, the contribution of exosomal B7–H4 to immunosuppression and tumor growth was investigated in vivo.Exosomes from irradiated GBM cells decreased the anti-tumor immune response of T cell in vitro and in vivo via delivered B7–H4. Mechanistically, irradiation promoted exosome biogenesis by increasing the ATM-ALIX interaction. Furthermore, the ATM-phosphorylated STAT3 was found to directly binds to the B7–H4 promoter to increase its expression. Finally, the radiation-induced increase in exosomal B7–H4 induced FoxP3 expression during Th1 cell differentiation via the activated STAT1 pathway. In vivo, exosomal B7–H4 decreased the radiation sensitivity of GBM cells, and reduced the survival of GBM mice model.This study showed that radiation-enhanced exosomal B7–H4 promoted immunosuppression and tumor growth, hence defining a direct link between irradiation and anti-tumor immune responses. Our results suggest that co-administration of radiotherapy with anti-B7-H4 therapy could improve local tumor control and identify exosomal B7–H4 as a potential tumor biomarker.

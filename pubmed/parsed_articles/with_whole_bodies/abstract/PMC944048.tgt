Syntheses using classic coupling reactions can be tedious, leading to a dearth of ambipolar semiconducting polymers. Here, we detail the rapid synthesis of balanced ambipolar polymers by using a carbon-hydrogen (C–H) activation strategy. Using this protocol, two C–H reactive hydrogenated monomers and six ambipolar polymers can be rapidly synthesized within 2 h via C–H activation and the optoelectronic properties of the resultant polymers can be characterized. We also describe the fabrication process and performance evaluation of the ambipolar polymers-based organic transistors.

Fractures of the coracoid process are uncommon injuries and are usually the result of high-energy trauma or avulsion-type injuries. Typically coracoid fractures treated with nonoperative management have yielded good results. Operative treatment of coracoid fractures is reserved for a subset of clinical situations, including fracture nonunion. We detail our technique for arthroscopic debridement of a Type II coracoid fracture nonunion, as well as the use of arthroscopic-assisted percutaneous fixation for a Type II coracoid fracture.

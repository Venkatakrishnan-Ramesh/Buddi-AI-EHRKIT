Research in contextEvidence before this studyLive-attenuated yellow fever vaccine YF17D is the basis for two licensed vaccines and other promising YF17D-based vaccine candidates, amongst others, Zika, HIV, Ebola, Lassa and malaria are under development.

Such remarkable potency confirms superior efficacy of YF17D-vectored vaccines against not only the thus vectored target antigen but also YFV. When we evaluated the impact of pre-existing YFV immunity in these two animal models, there was no evidence that strong vector-specific immunity would hamper the immunogenicity or protective efficacy of YF-S0, neither in mice nor hamsters and much in contrast to other viral vector platforms currently used in vaccine development. Likewise, our data suggest that YF-S0 and other YF17D-derivatives can also successful be used in populations with a high yellow fever vaccine coverage, for instance in Africa and South America.Implications of all the available evidenceThis study strongly suggests that YF-S0 could serve as a dual vaccine against both SARS-CoV-2 and YFV. Moreover, unlike other viral vector vaccines, pre-existing YFV immunity has no notable impact on novel YF17D-derived vaccines, endorsing their use also in people that have been vaccinated before.Alt-text: Unlabelled box
Live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine YF17D is the basis for two licensed vaccines and other promising YF17D-based vaccine candidates, amongst others, Zika, HIV, Ebola, Lassa and malaria are under development.

However, though YF17D is a widely used vaccines as well as potent viral vector, the impact of pre-existing YFV immunity on such YF17D-derivatives remains largely unknown.
In this study, we show that YF-S0 fully protects against lethal infection in a stringent intracranial YF17D challenge model in mice, and against vigorous challenge using hamster-adapted YFV Asibi in hamsters as relevant model that recapitulates yellow fever pathogenesis in humans. Such remarkable potency confirms superior efficacy of YF17D-vectored vaccines against not only the thus vectored target antigen but also YFV.

Few human vaccines are considered as successful as the live-attenuated yellow fever YF17D legacy vaccine that was developed in the 1930s and is still used as essential tool to containing yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreaks. YF17D is exceptionally efficient in inducing vigorous innate, long-lasting humoral and polyfunctional cell mediated immune (CMI) responses that possibly warrant life-long protection in most vaccinees.1 This outstanding efficacy of YF17D is combined with a very favourable safety profile.2
YFV is a highly pathogenic mosquito-borne small RNA virus which may result in a up to 60% mortality in infected patients. Death is mainly caused by severe gastrointestinal bleeding, epileptic status, severe metabolic acidosis, necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis, and multi-organ failure after infection.3 YFV is endemic in large parts of (sub)tropical Africa and Latin America, with more than one billion people living in areas of risk. Manufacturing in embryonated chicken eggs and need for a strict cold-chain for distribution make that classical YF17D vaccines are unable to keep up with the high global demand and YFV is estimated to still cause up to 60,000 fatalities annually.2,4 After decades of relatively low epidemic activity, recently several large YFV outbreaks (Angola 2015-2016, DRC 2016, Brazil 2016-2019, Nigeria 2017) led to an unprecedented vaccine shortage and repeated depletion of the global YF17D emergency stockpile.5 Furthermore, increasing global travel bares the risk of YFV being imported into regions where the virus is historically absent, such as the Asia Pacific region, that harbors both dense populations of competent vector mosquitos and billions of immunologically naïve people, raising serious concerns of massive future epidemics.6,7 A more sustainable YF17D vaccine supply and novel vaccines against YFV are needed.8
Beyond its use as genuine YFV vaccine, YF17D serves a particularly potent vector platform for several licensed recombinant vaccines; ChimeriVax-JE/Imojev® against Japanese encephalitis and CYD-TDV/Dengvaxia® against dengue.9 Other YF17D-based live vaccine candidates are under development, e.g. variants expressing foreign antigens from Lassa, Zika, or rabies virus, or therapeutic candidates for chronic hepatitis B.10, 11, 12, 13 Such YF17D derivatives generally inherit the excellent safety and immunogenicity features from parental YF17D.9 However, little attention has been paid so far to the fact that the available YF17D backbone may, besides promoting the immunogenicity of the thus vectored new antigen, suffice to conjointly induce full protection from YFV infection as well; hence creating in fact dual target vaccines.14,15 Likewise, the impact of pre-existing YFV immunity on the broader usability of YF17D as vaccine vector is limited to chimeric vaccines with their antigenic surface proteins swapped for those of other flaviviruses from distinct serogroups.16 Notably, for other virus-vectored vaccines, such as adenovirus-based vaccines, pre-existing anti-vector immunity is known to strongly interfere, compromise or modify subsequent target antigen-specific immunogenicity.17
Recently, we engineered a live-attenuated YF17D vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (YF-S0), which expresses the non-cleavable stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen as in-frame fusion within the YF17D-E/NS1 intergenic region. Two doses of YF-S0 given 7 days apart were shown to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) and strong antiviral CMI responses against both SARS-CoV-2, and resulted in full protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection in cynomolgus macaques and COVID-19-like lung pathology in a stringent hamster model. Moreover, in hamsters a single high dose of YF-S0 was sufficient to confer 60% and 100% protection from vigorous challenge within 10 and 21 days post immunization, respectively.18 YF-S0 safety was improved compared to parental YF17D, including in severely immune-compromised mice and hamsters, with limited biodistribution and shedding, and no mosquito transmission.18,19 Importantly, in addition to strong SARS-CoV-2 immunity, YF-S0 consistently induced high levels of YFV-specific nAbs, correlating with protection from lethal intracranial YF17D challenge in type I interferon receptor-deficient (Ifnar−/−) mice.18,20 Such a dual activity of YF-S0 may serve as special asset in poorly developed regions, for instance of Africa, where vaccine supply for both YFV and COVID-19 remains challenging.21
Here, we further evaluate in particular the YFV-specific immunity induced by single-dose YF-S0 vaccination and show how it translates, alike original YF17D, into full protection against YFV challenge in both stringent mouse and hamster models. Finally, we demonstrate how full protection of hamsters from vigorous SARS-CoV-2 challenge can readily be achieved by single-dose YF-S0 immunization, including in animals with strong pre-existing YFV-specific immunity. This lack of interference with vector immunity is unparalleled and may be unique to the live-attenuated YF17D vector platform.
BHK-21J (baby hamster kidney fibroblasts) cells were kindly provided by Prof. P. Bredenbeek, LUMC, Leiden, The Netherlands and maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM, Gibco). Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney, ATCC CRL-1586) and HEK293T (human embryonic kidney cells, ATCC CRL-3216) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco). All growth media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 1% sodium bicarbonate (Gibco).
All SARS-CoV-2 and hamster-adapted YFV Asibi related work was conducted in the high-containment BSL3 facilities of the KU Leuven Rega Institute (3CAPS) under licenses AMV 30112018 SBB 219 2018 0892 and AMV 23102017 SBB 219 2017 0589 according to institutional guidelines.
The design and generation of live-attenuated YF-S0 vaccine virus has been described in great detail elsewhere.18 YF17D virus, Stamaril® (lot G5400) (Sanofi-Pasteur) was passaged three times in Vero E6 cells before use. Medium used for production of virus stocks was identical to growth medium, yet containing only 2% fetal bovine serum. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay on BHK-21J cells, expressed as plaque forming units (PFU)/mL as described.14
A hamster-adapted YFV-Asibi strain resembling clone molecular Ap7M as described by Klitting et al. was rescued using previously established PLLAV (Plasmid Launched Live Attenuated Virus) technology and standard recombinant DNA technology employing homologous recombination in yeast S. cerevisiae.11,22,23 Briefly, the entire cDNA of YFV-Asibi clone Ap7M (Genbank accession number: MF926243) was divided into six fragments (A, B, C, D, E and F) averaging 2kb in size each with overlapping tails. The overall cloning strategy consisted of four steps (i-iv) and was based on the replacement of homologous YF17D sequences in pShuttle-YF17D and included the introduction of a selectable hygromycin-resistance cassette (derived from pAG26) as stuffer element (safety lock) in the thus assembled full-length viral cDNA; disrupting the YFV polyprotein ORF and hence facilitating work under BSL2 conditions.11,24 (i) All six cDNA fragments were synthesized as gene blocks (IDT, Belgium), amplified by PCR and cloned into intermediary plasmids pJET (ThermoScientific) and pAG26 (EUROSCARF plasmid P30113).24 The 3´-terminal fragment F was extended to attach a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme. Fragments A, B and C were fused by PCR and subcloned into pAG26. (ii) Fragment D and fused fragments EF were separately recombined (in yeast) into derivatives of pShuttle-YF17D (i.e. pShuttle-YF17D/Core-URA3 and pShuttle-YF17D/ENS1-URA3) replacing URA3 markers (derived from pAG61, EUROSCARF plasmid P30112) in their respective Core and E/NS1 gene regions; yielding each a subgenomic (5’ and 3’ part) cDNA clone in a pShuttle backbone.23,25 (iii) The resulting intermediary vectors (pD and pEF) were finally assembled with ABC in yeast to obtain non-functional, non-infectious but complete pABCDEF, i.e. a pShuttle-Asibi clone with the hygromycin resistance gene (safety lock) inserted in the XhoI site of the virus cDNA. All plasmids were validated by extensive restriction analysis and sequencing. (iv) Fully infectious YFV-Asibi cDNA was obtained by deleting the hygromycin resistance gene (via XhoI digest and re-ligation) under BSL3 conditions. The thus obtained plasmid material was transfected into sub-confluent BHK-21J cells for virus rescue. Working virus stocks were obtained by passaging supernatants twice in BHK-21J cells. The genome of rescued hamster-adapted YFV-Asibi virus was confirmed by direct sequencing. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay on BHK-21J cells before.
SARS-CoV-2 virus B1.1.7 variant (hCoV-19/Belgium/rega-12211513/2020; EPI_ISL_791333, 2020-12-21), also known as variant of concern (VOC) Alpha, was selected as challenge strain due to its particularly high fitness and aggressive growth in hamsters.26,27 Virus was grown on Vero E6 cells was used at passage 2, and median tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) were determined by titration using the Spearman-Kärber method. Strain identity and absence of furin site mutations in the virus stocks was confirmed by deep sequencing.26
Type I interferon receptor-deficient Ifnar−/− mice (Mus musculus) were bred in-house at the KU Leuven animal facility. Wild-type Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were purchased from Janvier Laboratories. Six to eight week-old male and female Ifnar−/− mice, and four week-old female hamsters were used throughout this study. All animals used were bred and housed (mice in groups of n=4-5; hamsters in pairs) under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions in individually ventilated Isocages (Techniplast). Hamsters and mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal administration of 100 μL (mice) or 500 μL (hamsters) Dolethal (200 mg/mL sodium pentobarbital, Vétoquinol SA).18,20,26
Housing conditions and experimental procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee of KU Leuven (license P015-2020), following Institutional Guidelines approved by the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA).
For assessment of vaccine immunogenicity, Ifnar−/− mice were vaccinated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a single 400 PFU dose of either YF-S0 or YF17D as positive control. Sham groups received a same volume of MEM containing 2% FBS (referred to as medium). I.p. administration of YF17D-based vaccine has previously been established by us as means for consistent immunization in mice (and hamsters), and to translate in a non-human primate model into immunogenicity and efficacy following vaccine delivery by the clinically more relevant subcutaneous route.18 After three weeks, mice were bled and serum was separated for antibody detection by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA) and serum neutralization test (SNT). Animals were then euthanized and spleens harvested for ELISpot and intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) (Figure 1b).Figure 1Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of single-dose YF-S0 vaccination in mice.

For assessment of vaccine efficacy, Ifnar−/− mice were vaccinated as before. Four weeks post-vaccination, mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of xylazine (16 mg kg−1, XYL-M, V.M.D.), ketamine (40 mg kg−1, Nimatek, EuroVet) and atropine (0.2 mg kg−1, Sterop), and then intracranially injected with 30μl containing 3 × 103 PFU YF17D. In a first experiment (survival), thus challenged animals were monitored daily for signs of disease and weight change for the next four weeks. Sick mice were euthanized based on morbidity (hind limb paralysis, weakness and ruffled fur) or weight loss of more than 25%. Mice who died within four days post-challenge (caused by acute brain trauma) were excluded from further analysis. In a second experiment, thus challenged mice and healthy controls (without any vaccination nor challenge) were euthanized four days post-challenge, and organs (livers, spleens, kidneys and brains) were collected for analysis of resulting viral loads (quantification of virus RNA) and gene-expression profiling (Figure 1b).
Hamsters were vaccinated i.p. with 104 PFU of either YF-S0 or YF17D as positive control at day 0, while sham groups received same volume of medium. Three weeks post-vaccination, animals were bled and challenged i.p. with 105 PFU of hamster-adapted YFV Asibi virus, a dose that has previously been shown to be 100% lethal in 3-weeks old hamsters.22 Control groups did not receive any vaccination nor challenge. Hamsters were monitored daily for signs of disease and weight change and euthanized five days post-challenge to collect organs (livers, spleens and kidneys) and end sera. Liver samples were collected in formalin for histological assessment. Hamster-adapted YFV Asibi virus only causes mortality in 3-4 week-old young hamsters. Thus, those 7 week-old (upon challenge) hamsters were euthanized five days post-challenge, at reported peak of viral load in the liver and of inflammation22 (Figure 2a).Figure 2Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of single-dose YF-S0 vaccination in hamsters.

To assess the effect of pre-exiting vector immunity, Ifnar−/− mice were pre-immunized i.p. with 400 PFU of YF17D at day -14. Then at day 0 mice were bled (for detection of baseline antibody levels) and subsequently vaccinated i.p. with 400 PFU of YF-S0, or a same volume of medium (as “YF17D only” control). Another group of Ifnar−/− mice was sham vaccinated at day -14, bled at day 0 and then vaccinated i.p. with 400 PFU of YF-S0 (as “YF-S0 only” control) or with a same volume of medium (as sham control). Three weeks after last immunization (day 21), mice were bled for serology and their spleens harvested for ELISpot (Figure 3a).Figure 3Impact of pre-existing YFV-specific immunity on immunogenicity of YF-S0 in mice.

Hamsters were pre-immunized i.p with 104 PFU of YF17D or a same volume of medium at day -21 and boosted following a single-dose (at day 0) or two-dose (at day 0 and 7 separately) regimen using each 104 PFU of YF-S0, or a same volume of medium at day 0. Matched controls and sham groups received same volumes of medium. All hamsters were bled at day 0 and day 21 for serological analysis. At day 21, hamsters were anesthetized by i.p. injection of a mixture of xylazine (16 mg kg−1, XYL-M, V.M.D.), ketamine (40 mg kg−1, Nimatek, EuroVet) and atropine (0.2 mg kg−1, Sterop) prior to challenge. Each hamster except hamsters from the control group was inoculated intranasally by gently adding a droplet of each 25 µl of virus stock containing in total 103 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.7 variant on each nostril. Hamsters were monitored daily for signs of disease (lethargy, heavy breathing or ruffled fur). Four days after challenge at peak of lung infection, animals were euthanized to collect end sera and lung tissue in MEM (for virus titration), or RNAlater (for gene-expression profiling)26 (Figure 4a; S4a).Figure 4Impact of pre-existing YFV-specific immunity on immunogenicity of single-dose YF-S0 and protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.7 variant challenge in hamsters.

Quantitative detection of YFV-specific and SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific total binding IgG by means of indirect immunofluorescent assay (IIFA) and of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) has been described in great detail before.18 In particular, SARS-CoV-2 nAb were determined using D614G spike-pseudotyped VSV-ΔG reporter viruses expressing GFP.18,28[preprint] YFV nAb were determined using mCherry-tagged YF17D reporter viruses.18,28[preprint,29] All reagents were prepared and methods were performed accordingly.
Assessment of YFV- and SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) by ELISpot and Flow cytometry with ICS was performed as established and described before.18,20 All peptides and reagents were prepared accordingly. The gating strategy used is outlined in Figure S1f.
RT-qPCR for lung homogenates was performed exactly as described in detail before.18,26,30 For YFV viral RNA level qualification, RT-qPCR was performed using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) by using primers and probe derived from YFV non-structural gene 3 (Supplementary Table 3). For absolute YFV RNA quantification, standard curves were generated using five-fold dilutions of a cDNA plasmid template (plasmid pShuttle-YF17D) of known concentration. Based on repeated standard curves, the lower limit of qualification was established at 2,111 copies/mg brain tissue, corresponding to a Ct value of 33. Ct values above 33 were considered below the limit of qualification and represented as the square root of the lower limit of qualification.20
For gene-expression profiling, RT-qPCR was performed on a Light Cycler 96 platform (Roche) using the iTaq Universal Probes One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (BioRad) with primers and probes (Supplementary Table 3). The relative RNA fold-change was calculated with the 2−ΔΔCq method using housekeeping gene Beta-actin (β-actin) for hamster samples and GAPDH for mouse samples for normalization.
To quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2, end-point titrations were performed on confluent Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates. Lung tissues were homogenized using bead disruption (Precellys) in 250 μl MEM and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C) to pellet the cell debris. Viral titers were calculated by the Reed and Muench method and expressed as TCID50 per mL tissue homogenate.26
For histological examination, liver was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, the extent and severity of the pathologic changes in each sample were evaluated observer-blinded by microscopic examination by a pathologist (T.R.) from the Department of Pathology, UZ Leuven. In liver sections, a grade was given by the degree of lobular/portal inflammation and hepatic necrosis: 0, normal; 1, minimal; 2, moderate; 3, severe. Score 4, additional hepatic necrosis in the presence of lobular inflammation.
Total and direct bilirubin in serum sample were determined by using Bilirubin Assay Kit (cat. no. MAK126, Sigma-Aldrich, Belgium), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined by using ALT Activity Assay kit (cat. no. MAK052, Sigma-Aldrich, Belgium) and LDH Activity Assay Kit (cat. no. MAK066, Sigma-Aldrich, Belgium), respectively. The data presented is the relative activity change as compared to the median value of healthy control group.
GraphPad Prism Version 9 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for all statistical evaluations. The number of animals and independent experiments that were performed is indicated in the figure legends. Statistical significance was determined using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Values were considered significantly different at P values of ≤0.05.
Single dose YF-S0 vaccination elicits strong humoral and cellular responses against both YFV and SARS-CoV-2 spike, and fully protects against lethal intracranial YF17D challenge in mice.
Humoral responses, especially nAb are considered major correlates of protection from both YFV and SARS-CoV-2 infection.1,31 Antibody responses were assessed in Ifnar−/− mice that are, in contrast to wild-type mice, readily susceptible to YF17D infection.20 For that purpose, a single dose of as little as 400 plaque-forming units (PFU) of YF-S0 or YF17D (Figure 1a, b) was administered via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route and sera sampled three weeks after vaccination. A similar yet two-dose protocol had earlier been shown to reflect robust immunization in a macaque model that employed a dose comparable to what is used clinically for YF17D administered via the subcutaneous route.18
Surprisingly, single YF-S0 vaccination elicited approximately equivalent levels of YFV-specific nAbs (log10-transformed geometric mean titres, log10 GMT 3.7, 95% CI 3.5–3.9) (Figure 1c) and total IgG (log10 GMT of 5.2, 95% CI 4.8–5.5) (Figure S1a) as YF17D vaccination (log10 GMT 3.8, 95% CI 3.5–4.1 for nAbs; log10 GMT 5.4, 95% CI 5.1–5.7 for IgG). Moreover, high levels of spike-specific nAbs (log10 GMT 2.3, 95% CI 1.8–2.8) (Figure 1d) and IgG (log10 GMT 3.3, 95% CI 3.1–3.5) (Figure S1b) were conjointly induced after a single low YF-S0 dose in mice.
To assess CMI responses, splenocytes were collected similarly three weeks after immunization (Figure 1b). Single YF-S0 vaccination resulted in marked YFV-specific T cell responses, as confirmed by a high number of spot-forming units in IFNγ ELISpot using a MHC-I restricted peptide derived from the YFV NS3 protein for re-stimulation (Figure 1e). Further profiling by intracellular straining (ICS) revealed the induction of YFV-specific CD4+, CD8+ and γδ+ T cells producing IFNγ and TNFα after re-stimulation with a YFV NS4B peptide pool (Figure S1c), or likewise of CD8+ T cells probed by the NS3 peptide (Figure S1d). As expected, in YF-S0 vaccinated mice showed considerable CD8+ and γδ+ T cell responses to spike peptide (Figure S1e). A specific elevation of other markers such as IL-4 (Th2 polarization), IL-17A (Th17), or FoxP3 (regulatory T-cells) was not observed by the current ICS approach (not shown), yet has been confirmed earlier by qPCR.18 In summary, single-dose YF-S0 vaccination induces robust humoral and Th1 CMI responses against both YFV and SARS-CoV-2 spike in mice.
To evaluate the protective efficacy of single YF-S0 against YFV infection, thus vaccinated Ifnar−/− mice were challenged with a lethal intracranial (i.c.) dose of 3 × 103 PFU of YF17D four weeks post-vaccination (Figure 1b). YF17D and sham-vaccinated animals served as positive and negative controls, respectively. I.c. challenge has been established as a stringent method to evaluate protection conferred by YF17D and YF17D-derived vaccines in mice.11,15,20 All sham-immunized mice experienced acute weight loss and progressed rapidly to severe neurological disease with ruffled fur, hunched posture and hind limb paralysis, uniformly reaching human endpoint as early as five days post infection (dpi) (Figure 1f), whereas full protection was conferred in mice vaccinated with either YF-S0 or YF17D, as confirmed by the absence of any signs of disease, rapid recovery and weight gain (Figure S1g). High level of viral RNA loads was detected in liver (with mean viral RNA loads 105.7 copies/mg tissue), spleen (107.9 copies/mg), kidney (105.2 copies/mg), and brain (108.5 copies/mg) of sham-immunized controls. In contrast, in YF-S0 vaccinated mice 4 dpi no viral RNA was detectable anymore in livers and kidneys, and viral RNA loads were significantly reduced in their brains and spleens; comparable to original YF17D vaccination (Figure 1g-j). Also, single YF-S0 resulted, like YF17D vaccination, in an almost complete normalization of cytokine expression profiles serving as a sensitive marker of viscerotropic and neurotropic YFV disease; especially in the liver, regarding IP-10 (as a marker for liver disease initiation and progression), CXCL9 (liver damage) and IFNγ (Figure 1k; S1h).32,33 Similarly, IP-10 and IFNγ showed normal expression in the spleens and brains of YF-S0 and YF17D vaccinated mice equaling healthy controls; hence markedly lower than in sham-immunized mice (Figure 1k; S1h). Together these data indicate that single YF-S0 vaccination provides full protection against YF17D i.c. challenge as well as YFV-induced inflammatory damage to the liver and other relevant target organs in mice, comparable to original YF17D.18
Single YF-S0 vaccination induces robust humoral responses against both YFV and spike, and provides full protection against a YFV-Asibi challenge and YFV-induced viscerotropic disease in hamsters.
Hamster-adapted YFV-Asibi strain causes viscerotropic disease in adult hamsters replicating key clinical features of genuine YFV infection in humans; likewise, full lethality is observed only in young (3-4 week-old) hamsters.22,34 To confirm the protective efficacy of YF-S0 against genuine YFV infection, four week-old hamsters were immunized i.p. with 104 PFU of either YF-S0 or YF17D, and challenged three weeks post-vaccination with a 105 PFU i.p. dose of hamster-adapted YFV-Asibi virus (Figure 2a) that had been rescued using previously established PLLAV technology.11,19 A single dose of YF-S0 induced consistently high levels of YFV-specific nAbs (log10 GMT 2.9, 95% CI 1.9–3.9) (Figure 2b) and IgG (log10 GMT 3.8, 95% CI 2.6–4.9) (Figure S2a) in 8 out of 9 vaccinated hamsters (primary vaccine failure in 1/9); comparable to original YF17D regarding IgG and somewhat lower for nAbs (YF17D: log10 GMT 4.2, 95% CI 4.0–4.4 and log10 GMT 4.0, 95% CI 3.8–4.1, respectively) (Figure 2b; S2a). Notably, in either case, nAbs levels largely exceeded nAb titers >1:40 considered to correlate with protection in the hamster model.35 Consistent with YF-S0 vaccination in Ifnar−/− mice and previously published data,18,28[preprint] strong spike-specific nAbs responses (log10 GMT 2.3, 95% CI 1.5–3.0) (Figure 2c) and IgG (log10 GMT 2.8, 95% CI 1.9–3.6) (Figure S2b) were conjointly induced.
After challenge, hamsters vaccinated with either YF17D or YF-S0 remained healthy, while sham-immunized animals suffered from clear signs of severe YFV-induced disease such as desiccation, lethargy, growth retardation and weight loss, and had to be euthanized as early as 5 dpi (Figure S2c). Accordingly at necropsy, livers of sham-immunized hamsters appeared macroscopically paler and softer than normal livers of YF-S0 and YF17D vaccinated hamsters. Further, high viral RNA loads were detected in liver (mean viral RNA load 108.2 copies/mg tissue), spleen (106.0 copies/mg) and kidney (106.4 copies/mg) of all sham-immunized hamsters (Figure 2d-f). By contrast, with exception of the one animal that had not seroconverted (Figure 2b-c), viral RNA remained undetectable in the livers of the majority (6/9) of YF-S0 vaccinated hamsters, and showed a marked reduction in spleens and kidneys similar to YF17D vaccinated animals. Moreover, compared to a completely normal liver histology in YF-S0 or YF17D immunized animals, livers of sham-immunized hamsters showed significant pathological changes (Figure 2g), including severe lobular inflammation, portal inflammation, and severe hepatic necrosis, consistent with the high viral loads detected in the liver (Figure 2h, i).
Liver function and damage were measured by serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and total and direct bilirubin levels.34 ALT (liver injury and hepatic necrosis; Figure 2j) and LDH (tissue damage and toxicity; Figure 2k) activity was markedly increased following YFV-Asibi challenge in sham-immunized hamsters 5 dpi, whereas no significant elevation was detected in YF-S0 or YF17D immunized hamsters over healthy controls. Similarly, significantly elevated levels of bilirubin (total: 3.8 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.3–5.5 mg/dL; direct: 1.9 mg/dL, 95% CI 1.3–2.5mg/dL; geometric means) were detected in sham-immunized hamsters, indicative for icteric malfunction of the liver. In contrast, bilirubin levels in YF-S0 and YF17D immunized hamsters were in the normal range (reference: 0.1–0.9 mg/dL),34 though slightly increased compared to healthy controls (Figure 3l; S2d).
Finally, immunization with either YF-S0 or YF17D resulted in a nearly complete normalization of intrahepatic IP-10 chemokine expression (Figure 2m; S2e). In addition, these hamsters also showed no systemic MX2 expression anymore (Figure 2m; S2e), an IFN-stimulated gene triggered by virus infection.18,30 Collectively, these results indicate that single-dose YF-S0 vaccination provides full protection against YFV challenge and virus-induced viscerotropic disease in hamsters, comparable to original YF17D.
Pre-existing anti-vector immunity is of general concern regarding the wide application of viral vector vaccines.36 Previous flaviviruses exposure has been reported to influence the outcomes of subsequent heterologous flavivirus infections and vaccination.37, 38, 39, 40 Given (i) that people living in YFV-endemic areas may have ideally received yellow fever vaccination before, and (ii) considering the exceptional durability of YF17D-induced immunity in humans,1 it is essential to determine to what extent immunogenicity and protective efficacy of YF-S0 will be impacted by pre-existing YFV immunity.
To assess the role pre-existing vector immunity may play, Ifnar−/− mice vaccinated with 400 PFU of YF17D (at day -14) were subsequently re-vaccinated (boosted) with 400 PFU of YF-S0 or medium two weeks post prime immunization (day 0; Figure 3a). As reported earlier, YF17D-induced humoral responses reach a plateau around two weeks post-vaccination in Ifnar−/− mice.20 As expected, high levels of YFV-specific antibodies (nAbs: log10 GMT >3.2) (Figure 3b, Table 1a) were hence induced in all YF17D-immunized mice at day 0, whereas YF-S0 vaccination boosted these pre-established YFV-specific antibodies by about 6-fold (YF17D+S0; Figure 3c). However, no significant differences were observed in YFV-specific T cell responses among different vaccinated groups, as confirmed by IFNγ ELISpot (Figure 3e, Table 1b). Importantly, such strong YFV-specific immunity (Figure 3b) had no impact (p>0.5; Kruskal–Wallis test) on YF-S0 induced spike-specific nAbs (Figure 3d) nor IgG (Figure S3a) responses in mice (17D+S0 group; Table 1a). Furthermore, as demonstrated by IFNγ ELISpot (Figure 3f, Table 1b), also obvious spike-specific T cell responses were induced in the presence of this strong pre-existing YFV-specific immunity (17D+S0 group), albeit possibly to some lesser extent than to naïve mice solely vaccinated with YF-S0 (S0 group). In summary, strong pre-existing YFV vector-specific immunity has no major impact on the immunogenicity live YF17D-vectored YF-S0 in mice.Table 1a.

Like other currently licensed COVID-19 vaccines, YF-S0 expresses a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein of prototypic WA1 strain (spike from the 2019 variant Wuhan-Hu-1).31 An updated version of YF-S0 expressing an adapted spike sequence to cover emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) is under development (YF-S0*; Sharma et al. BioRxiv).28 Cosmopolitan SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (VOC Alpha) dominated the pandemic in the first half of 2021 and was shown to cause particularly aggressive infections in the hamster model.26,27
To evaluate the impact of YF17D vector-specific immunity on the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of YF-S0 against aggressive B1.1.17 variant infection, hamsters were first immunized against YFV using 104 PFU YF17D (at day -21) prior to subsequent vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 following either a single (17D+S0) (day 0; 104 PFU) (Figure 4a) or two-dose (17D+2S0) (day 0 and 7; 104 PFU) (Figure S4a) regimen of YF-S0. Animals were subsequently challenged intranasally with 103 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.7 variant at day 21.
By day 0 prior to YF-S0 vaccination, consistently high levels of YFV-specific nAbs (log10 GMT > 4.8) were present in all YF17D-immunized hamsters (Figure 4b, Table 2). As expected, pre-existing YFV-specific antibody responses (as of day 0) were boosted by either a single- (Figure 4b, c) or two-dose (Figure S4b, c) YF-S0 vaccination by day 21 (Table 2). Importantly, spike-specific nAbs (log10 GMT > 1.9) were elicited in all vaccinated hamsters with or without pre-existing YFV-specific nAbs (Table 2). No significant differences were observed between the single YF-S0 vaccination group (S0; log10 GMT 2.0, 95% CI 0.9–3.0) and the 17D+S0 group (log10 GMT 2.6, 95% CI 2.1–3.2) (Figure 4d); nor between the dual YF-S0 vaccination group (2S0; log10 GMT 2.2, 95% CI 1.1–3.1) and the 17D+2S0 group (log10 GMT 2.3, 95% CI 2.0–2.6) (Figure S4d, Table 2). These data indicate that strong pre-existing YF17D vector immunity has no major impact on the mounting of vigorous humoral immune responses induced by either a single- or two-dose YF-S0 vaccination in hamsters, fully corroborating immunogenicity data obtained in mice.Table 2Mean ± 95% CI value of Log10-transformed reciprocal titers for YFV-specific nAbs (in Figure 4b-c; S4b-c), spike-specific nAbs (in Figure 4d; S4d) titers and TCID50/mg lung tissue (in Figure 4e; S4e). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of SNT assay to determine YFV-specific and spike-specific nAbs titer was 2.2 Log10 (≥1:150) and 1.6 Log10 (≥1:40), respectively.Table 2YFV-nAbs day 0YFV-nAbs day 21Spike-nAbs day 21TCID50/mgSham0.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.000.00 ± 0.006.26 ± 0.2917D4.82 ± 0.224.73 ± 0.280.00 ± 0.006.32 ± 0.34S00.00 ± 0.003.45 ± 1.271.97 ± 1.020.77 ± 1.8317D + S05.00 ± 0.214.84 ± 0.162.64 ± 0.541.14 ± 1.812S00.00 ± 0.004.21 ± 0.482.22 ± 0.910.00 ± 0.0017D + 2S04.80 ± 0.125.04 ± 0.232.29 ± 0.270.00 ± 0.00

The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of SNT assay to determine YFV-specific and spike-specific nAbs titer was 2.2 Log10 (≥1:150) and 1.6 Log10 (≥1:40), respectively.
Thus treated animals were subsequently infected with B1.1.7 virus via the nasal route. Resulting virus replication in the lower respiratory tract was monitored by virus titration of lung homogenates 4 dpi. As established before,18,28[preprint] high infectious virus loads (mean 6.2 log10 TCID50/mg) were detected in the lungs of sham- or YF17D-immunized hamsters. By contrast no infectious virus was detected in most (7/8) single YF-S0-immunzied hamsters (Figure 4e), and infectious virus was absent from all (8/8) of the two-dose YF-S0-immunized hamsters (Figure S4e). These results confirm that besides dual- (Sharma et al. BioRxiv) also single-dose YF-S0 vaccination can provide protection against B1.1.7 variant infection in hamsters.28[preprint] In a few animals protection against B1.1.7 variant infection was noticed even in the absence of detectable spike-specific nAbs (Figure 4d; S4d, S4g), suggesting that except nAbs, also other immune components contribute to protection against SARS-CoV-2.31
Importantly, also when animals were vaccinated in the presence of strong YFV-specific nAbs, most hamsters (6/8) in the 17D+S0 group and all hamsters (8/8) in the 17D+2S0 group were protected from B1.1.7 infection. This was demonstrated by the absence of any detectable infectious virus in their lungs 4 dpi (Figure 4e; S4e). High level of protection is further supported by a marked reduction in the expression of IP-10 and MX2 (serving as markers for inflammation and lung pathology)18,26,30 in the lungs of YF-S0 vaccinated hamsters compared to sham- and YF17D-immunized controls (Figure 4f; S4f). In summary, these results suggest that strong pre-existing YFV immunity has no major impact on protection against stringent SARS-CoV-2 infection challenge conferred by either single- or two-dose YF-S0 vaccination. Such overruling of vector-specific immunity by live YF17D-vectored vaccines can be expected to be independent of the inserted foreign antigen.
More than 30 vaccines and vaccine candidates have been authorized for (conditional) use in humans, significantly contributing to the control of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, current first-generation COVID-19 vaccines are unlikely to hit all real-world challenges linked to global immunization. Certainly, the world will benefit from an expanded vaccine portfolio that allows countries to select most suitable vaccines considering the specific needs of their healthcare system, population structure, cold chain capacity and of manufacturing cost, amongst many other critical factors.41 Particularly, readily affordable and accessible, and likewise safe and potent COVID-19 vaccines are needed to control the pandemic at global scale, including in regions for instance of Africa with underdeveloped healthcare systems, where vaccine supply generally remains challenging in light of an already heavy burden of (re-)emerging infectious diseases.42,43 Additionally, the COVID-19 crisis has disrupted production and access to other essential vaccines and on-going vaccination campaigns, including yellow fever immunization, increasing the disease burden and risk of future outbreaks concomitant with SARS-CoV-2.21,44 A dual-target vaccine like YF-S0 or its variant-proof updated version YF-S0* (Sharma et al. BioRxiv)28 might hence be of extra benefit for those regions of African and South America in which also YFV is endemic.
Previously, we demonstrated that YF-S0, next to being well tolerated, highly immunogenic and effective against SARS-CoV-2 prototypic WA1 strain, led in cynomolgus macaques also to the rapid induction of YFV-specific nAbs that were excessively higher than what is required to protect from lethal YFV infection.1,18 In full support of these data, we now show that a single dose of YF-S0 was sufficient to elicit high nAbs and IgG levels against both YFV and spike in mice (Figure 1c-d; S1a-b) and hamsters (Figure 2b-c; S2a-b); as well as robust and polyfunctional CMI against both YFV (Figure 1e; S1c-d; 3e) and spike (Figure S1e; 3f) as demonstrated in mice. Moreover, this single-dose YF-S0 vaccination fully protects against lethal intracranial YF17D challenge and YFV-induced organ damage in a stringent Ifnar−/− mouse model (Figure 1f-k; S1f).11,14,15,20 Hamster represents a relevant small animal model, which reproduces key symptoms of human YFV infection and viscerotropic disease after hamster-adapted YFV Asibi infection.22,34 Remarkably, our results indicate that single-dose YF-S0 vaccination provides full protection against vigorous YFV challenge (Figure 2d-i; S2c) as well as YFV-induced viscerotropic disease (Figure 2j-m; S2d), comparable to YF17D immunization. Collectively, YF-S0 also represents a potent YFV vaccine candidate. Formal assessment of clinical efficacy in human clinical trials for such a dual target product may be challenging. Nevertheless, the excellent YFV antibody responses concomitantly induced by YF-S0 vaccination may suffice as correlate of protection.1,2 Likewise, with growing insight into SARS-CoV-2 immunity, also future COVID-19 vaccines may get licensed solely through demonstration of protective immune responses,45 possibly based on serological markers such as anti-RBD IgG and neutralizing titers.46
A general issue regarding viral vector vaccines concerns their sensitivity to pre-existing anti-vector immunity.17,36,47 Anti-vector immunity has shown profound impact particularly on non-replicating viral vector vaccines, such as replication-defective herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-based and various adenovirus (Ad)-based recombinant vaccines (including multiple serotypes: Ad5, Ad11, Ad35, and chimpanzee Ad) in both mice and rhesus monkeys, as well as in phase I human clinical trials.48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 In contrast, on live replication-competent viral vectors pre-existing anti-vector immunity seems to have a limited impact, as anti-measles immunity had only a minor impact on the performance of recombinant measles virus-based vaccines in mice, macaques or humans.55, 56, 57, 58 Pre-existing flavivirus immunity could affect the infection outcomes and immunogenicity of subsequent flavivirus infection or vaccination.37, 38, 39 Most studies have focused on the interference between dengue and Zika viruses as closely antigenically related and potentially prone to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection.37,38 However, despite being a widely used human vaccine and desirable viral vector, investigations on the impact of pre-existing YFV-specific immunity are limited.1,9 Interestingly, in phase 3 human trials of YF17D-based dengue vaccine CYD-TDV/Dengvaxia®, subjects with prior flaviviruses infections demonstrated rather an improved than compromised immunogenicity compared to immunologically flaviviruses naïve recipients.59,60
Here, by trialling our YF-S0 vaccine candidate first in mice and then in hamsters, we demonstrate that at least under the preclinical conditions tested, strong pre-existing YFV-specific immunity has no major impact on YF-S0 induced humoral responses (Figure 3d; S3a; 4d; S4d). Some (non-significant) reduction in CMI (Figure 3f) observed in mice is consistent with the relatively higher impact of pre-existing anti-vector immunity on subsequent cellular immunity, further depending on the animal model used.37,53,61 Importantly, we clearly demonstrate that pre-existing YFV-specific immunity does not lead to a reduction in the efficacy of YF-S0 to protect against SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.7 variant in hamsters (Figure 4e; S4e), neither after a single- nor two-dose vaccination. Of note, several YF17D-derived vaccine candidates primarily targeting African populations, including those against dengue, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, Ebola and Lassa, are currently being tested.9,11,12,16 Our results strongly suggest that it might be feasible to use YF-S0 and other YF17D derivatives in those YFV seropositive populations, either in a single-does or two-dose regiment.
Taken together, YF-S0 represents as a potent dual vaccine candidate against both SARS-CoV-2 and YFV infection, possibly feasible as single-dose vaccination. Such a dual vaccine would be of benefit for (i) containing current COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) alleviating the burden of YF17D vaccine shortage; (iii) contributing to the WHO Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) programme; and (iv) at once precluding potential YFV outbreaks in areas such as in Asia-Pacific region from which the virus is historically absent while actually implementing a COVID-19 immunization program. More in general, both dual protection and maintaining of vaccine efficacy in subjects with strong pre-existing vector immunity are unique and should translate to other vaccines built on the same the live-attenuated YF17D vector platform.

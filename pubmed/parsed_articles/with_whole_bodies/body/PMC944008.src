Al–Cu alloys have a high strength-to-density ratio, and good fatigue and damage tolerance, which is widely used in aerospace and engineering structure applications [1], [2], [3]. Nowadays, a large number of aircrafts have reached the end of their service life. Their number will increase in the coming years, providing an abundant sources of valuable recycled metals, a large part of which are Al-Cu alloys. Thanks to the high recyclability and sustainability of Al, most of these Al scraps are recycled, which leads to reduce energy consumption, reducing greenhouse gas and solid waste, promoting circular economy [4], [5].
However, due to the various sources of Al scraps and use of iron-based tools, these impurity elements, such as, Fe and Si, are easily introduced to the recycled Al alloys [6], [7], [8], [9]. Fe is the main impurity element in Al-Cu alloys, that form hard and brittle plate-like Fe-rich intermetallic phases (named Fe-rich phases hereinafter) during solidification [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. The type of Fe-rich phases in Al-Cu alloys, such as, Al3(CuFe), Al6(CuFe), Al7Cu2Fe (β-Fe), Al15Fe3(SiCu)2 (α-Fe), varies with different alloy compositions, cooling rates, and external fields during solidification [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. The presence of these brittle particles (especially the large sizes) in the alloys significantly decreases the fatigue strength and ductility of the alloys [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. In order to avoid these problems and foster the use of these recycled Al alloys, various methods are used: 1) The chemical route to change the morphology of Fe-rich particles by adding trace elements or grain refiner before solidification [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]; 2) applying ultrasonic or electromagnetic fields to refine the microstructure during solidification [22], [23], [24], [25]; 3) using heat treatments or thermomechanical processing, such as rolling or extrusion, to broke the Fe-rich particles after solidification [26], [27], [28], [29]. In some alloys, Fe is deliberately added for improving their strength at room temperature [30], [31] or their high-temperature properties [32], [33]. Hence, it is necessary to optimize in-service condition of recycled Al alloys by adjusting the Fe content and Fe-rich particles morphology.
It is well accepted that the Al-5Ti-1B master alloy has Al3Ti and TiB2 nucleant particles. This plays a critical role in the grain refinement, reducing pores and micro-segregations reduction, which enhances Al alloys mechanical properties [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. Moreover, the Al-5Ti-1B addition can alter the solidification sequence and change the morphology of Fe-rich phases in Al alloys during solidification [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. The influence of Al-5Ti-1B can be ascribed to the following three aspects: 1) refinement of the Fe-rich particles size without changing their type [35], [36], [42]; 2) promotion of the formation of plate-like Fe-rich phases [37], [38], [39], [40]; 3) promotion of the transformation of Fe-rich phases from plate-like to Chinese-script [20], [21], [41]. The formation of different Fe-rich phases depends on the alloy composition and cooling rate. Al-5Ti-1B addition to Al-Mg alloys [35], [36] not only refine the primary Al grains but also refines the α-Fe particles. Both effects are related through the refinement of Al grains that limits the growth of α-Fe phases in the interdendritic liquid regions during subsequently eutectic reaction.
The size of primary Al3Fe phases in Al-Fe alloys is also reduced by Al-5Ti-1B addition [42]. Submicron-scale tomography results in Al-Mg-Si alloy [37] clearly demonstrated that Al-5Ti-1B reduces the number and length of α-Fe and β-Al5FeSi (β-Fe) particles. This improvement is produced because TiB2 act as nucleation site for α-Fe and β-Fe. Moreover, some researchers [38], [39], [40] found that Al-5Ti-1B induces the formation of β-Fe phases in Al-Si alloys. They deduced that TiB2 particles have a small misfit with β-Fe phase. In our previous studies [20], [21], it has been shown that the addition of Al-5Ti-1B to Al-Fe and Al-Cu-Fe alloys promotes the formation of Al6Fe phases and inhibit the growth of primary Al3Fe phases. However, the study of Al-5Ti-1B addition on the solidification sequence and distribution of Fe-rich phases of high-Fe-containing recycled Al-Cu alloys remains unknown.
Ultrasonic melt processing, USMP, is a promising economical technology that provides an environment-friendly method for improving the soundness and quality of cast ingots [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. It is generally believed that the action mechanisms of USMP on solidifying microstructure can be ascribed to two aspects: 1) the cavitation bubbles generated by acoustic cavitation that continually attack and broke the dendritic structure and the intermetallic phases; 2) acoustic streaming improves solute homogeneity which homogenizes the spatial distribution of dendrites and intermetallic phases [43], [44], [45]. Extensive works have been conducted to demonstrate that USMP refines the Al grain size, improve the microstructural homogenisation, and enhance the properties of Al alloys [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the USMP reduces the macro-segregation and boosts the formation of fine and homogenously distributed Fe-rich phases in Al-Si-Fe alloys [56], [57]. Also, the USMP has been used to tune the Fe-rich phases in Al alloys at different solidification stages [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63]. Moreover, the USMP changes the shape of α-Fe phases from coarse Chinese-script to fine polygonal type in Al-Si alloys [58]. At melt temperatures below 600 °C, the acoustic streaming distributes the solute homogenously. At melt temperatures of 600–750 °C, the acoustic cavitation promotes the nucleation and breaks the large particles. The morphology of primary Al3Fe phases in Al-Fe alloys changes from plate-like to blocky and granular shape by applying USMP, which is due to cavitation-induced fragmentation of primary Al3Fe and enhances the nucleation and refines the size of Al3Fe. Both effects improve the mechanical properties of the alloys [60]. The size of α-Fe in Al-Si alloys is also greatly reduced by acoustic cavitation during USMP [61]. Acoustic streaming and cavitation of USMP homogenize the solute distribution and the temperature fields in Al-Si alloys. This results in the presence of refined δ-Al4(FeMn)Si2 Fe-rich particles [62]. In Al-Si-Fe alloys the plate-like β-Al9Si2Fe2 phases was replaced by star-like α-Al12Si2Fe phases [63]. This morphological modification and phase transformation is due to the acoustic cavitation that induces melt undercooling and increases the nucleation of Fe-rich phases. However, to author’s knowledge, the combined effect of USMP and Al-5Ti-1B on the solidification sequences and growth of Fe-rich phases in recycled Al-Cu alloys have not been reported yet.
Hence, the effect of USMP and Al-Ti-B on the growth of α-Al and Fe-rich phases in Al-Cu-Mn-Mg-Fe-Si alloys is comparatively studied in the present work. Optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermal analysis were used to characterize the microstructural evolution of the alloy during solidification. The detailed mechanism of USMP + Al-Ti-B on the growth of α-Al and Fe-rich phases is briefly discussed.
Commercial pure Al (99.8 %), Al-50Cu, Al-20Fe, Al-10Mn, Al-10Mg and Al-20Si master alloys were used to produce the studied alloys. The selection of Al-Cu-Mn-Mg-Si-Fe alloys is based on the A206 alloy, which has high mechanical properties and is widely used in the aerospace and automotive sectors. These alloys were added to a graphite crucible for melting and they were heated to 800 °C under an energetic stirring for liquid homogenisation. Then, the melts were degassed using C2Cl6 and the slag removed by mechanical methods. Al-10Mg and 0.2 % Al-5Ti-1B master alloys were added into the melts under mechanical stirring to reduce the Mg loss in the alloys. The average size of TiB2 particles in the Al-5Ti-1B master alloys is 0.77 ± 0.28 μm [21]. Finally, the melts were poured into a preheated steel mould (see Fig. 1) at 750 °C. During the solidification process, the cooling curves were recorded in the centre of the ingots. 8 alloys were prepared: 0.7Fe+Al-Ti-B, 1.2Fe+Al-Ti-B, 0.7Fe+USMP, 0.7Fe+Al-Ti-B+USMP, 1.2Fe+USMP, 1.2Fe+Al-Ti-B +USMP that are termed as 0.7FeB, 1.2FeB, 0.7FeU, 0.7FeUB, 1.2FeU, 1.2FeUB, respectively, for simplicity. The chemical composition of the studied alloys was analysed by optical spectrometry, and the results are summarized in Table 1.Fig. 1Schematic diagram of (a) the ultrasonic melt treatment process; (b) casting process; (c) the sample position taken from the ingots.Table 1Chemical composition of the studied alloys (wt.%).Designed AlloyCuMnFeMgSiTiAl0.7Fe4.660.540.600.500.22–Bal.0.7FeB4.580.540.570.500.260.22Bal.1.2Fe4.410.521.080.490.21–Bal.1.2FeB4.420.531.150.500.280.19Bal.0.7FeU4.600.520.720.570.040.13Bal.0.7FeUB4.300.520.700.570.190.14Bal.1.2FeU4.520.501.180.600.150.13Bal.1.2FeUB4.310.531.210.570.190.14Bal.
The ultrasonic equipment is made up of an ultrasonic generator (1 kW), an magnetostrictive transducer (18 KHz) and an ultrasonic sonotrode (Ti-6Al-4V horn diameter: 30 mm). The schematic diagram of the ultrasonic melt processing setup is shown in Fig. 1a. During the experiment, the sonotrode was preheated to 400 °C using the electric-resistance coil to reduce the chilling effect. The sonotrode was inserted 30 mm into the melt at 710 °C, 5 min after the ultrasonic treatment, the melt temperature is about 695 °C. At this temperature, the melt is fully liquid, as the liquidus temperature of these two alloys are both about 640 °C. After that, the sonotrode was withdrawn from the melt and the crucible was extracted from the furnace for casting (Fig. 1b). Also, a thermocouple located in the centre of mould was used to record the cooling curves during solidification. The samples were cut using wire electrical discharge machining at the bottom of the ingot (Fig. 1c), and the size of the different samples is also schematic displayed in Fig. 1c).
The metallographic samples (size: 7 × 7 × 7 mm3) were cut from the bottom of the ingots and prepared by standard grinding, polishing, and etching processes. Optical microscope (LEICA/DMI5000M, Germany) was used to analysis the microstructure of the casting alloys. A SEM (Sigma 500, Zeiss, Germany) combined with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS, Oxford) was used to observe the microstructure and identify the phases present in the alloys. The 3D morphology of the Fe-rich phases was revealed by methanol and solid iodine solution used to remove the Al matrix for 3–6 h. 30 binarized optical images were used to calculate the Fe-rich phases average size. The EBSD maps and Kikuchi patterns were measured using a sample-to-detector distance of ∼ 10 mm and a voltage of 20 kV at the SEM. The sample was tilted 70° with respect to the detector. The scanning step size was set at 1 μm. The conventional procedure of counting grain boundaries in vertical and horizontal lines was used to calculate the average grain size. The samples were heated at a constant heating rate from 25 °C to 700 °C in DSC (Netzsch DSC 404, Germany) and then a constant cooling rate (10 °C/min) to 25 °C with the protection of Ar gas.
The solidification sequences of 0.7Fe and 1.2Fe alloys were calculated by using the Scheil model in Thermo-Calc software. The results are shown in Fig. 2. In 0.7Fe alloy (Fig. 2a), the solidification sequences are: 1) L → α-Al; 2) L → α-Al + Al3(FeMn); 3) L → α-Al + Al3(FeMn) + Al6(FeMn); 4) L → α-Al + Al6(FeMn); 5) L → α-Al + Al6(FeMn) + Al7Cu2Fe (β-Fe); 6) L → α-Al + β-Fe; 7) L → α-Al + Al6(FeMn) + β-Fe + Al15Fe3Si2(α-Fe); 8) L → α-Al + α-Fe; 9) L → α-Al + α-Fe + Al2Cu; 10) L → α-Al + α-Fe + Al2Cu + Mg2Si; 11) L → α-Al + α-Fe + Al2Cu + Mg2Si + Al2CuMg (S). The β-Fe and S phases are not detected in the alloys due to the low content. In 1.2Fe alloy (Fig. 2b), the solidification sequences are similar to that of the 0.7Fe alloy except for the primary Al3(FeMn) phases. So, the individual phase transformation for 0.7Fe alloy is: L → α-Al + Al3(FeMn) + α-Fe + β-Fe + Al2Cu + Mg2Si + Al2CuMg; for 1.2Fe alloy is: L → α-Al + Al3(FeMn) + Al6(FeMn) + β-Fe + Al2Cu + Mg2Si + Al2CuMg. Fig. 2c shows the vertical section of Al-4.5Cu-0.5Mn-0.5Mg-0.2Si-xFe (x = 0–2) alloys, which demonstrates that the high Fe content promotes the formation of Al3Fe phases. Table 2 shows the solidification sequences of 0.7Fe and 1.2Fe alloys obtained from the thermodynamic calculation (Fig. 2a and b). The Scheil solidification sequences obtained from the thermodynamic calculation are listed in Table 2.Fig. 2The solidification sequences of different alloys calculated using Thermo-Calc software:(a) 0.7Fe alloy; (b) 1.2Fe alloy; (c) the vertical section of Al-4.5Cu-0.5Mn-0.5Mg-0.2Si-xFe (x = 0–2) alloys.Table 2The Scheil solidification sequences obtained from the thermodynamic calculation.0.7Fe alloy1.2Fe alloy1LL2L → α-AlL → Al3Fe3L → α-Al + Al3FeL → α-Al + Al3Fe4L + Al3Fe → α-Al + Al6FeL + Al3Fe → α-Al + Al6Fe5L → α-Al + Al6FeL → α-Al + Al6Fe6L + Al6Fe → α-Al + β-FeL + Al6Fe → α-Al + β-Fe7L → α-Al + β-FeL → α-Al + β-Fe8L + β-Fe → α-Al + α-FeL + β-Fe → α-Al + α-Fe9L → α-Al + α-FeL → α-Al + α-Fe10L → α-Al + α-Fe + Al2CuL → α-Al + α-Fe + Al2Cu11L → α-Al + Mg2Si + Al2CuL → α-Al + Mg2Si + Al2Cu12L → α-Al + Mg2Si + Al2Cu + Al2CuMgL → α-Al + Mg2Si + Al2Cu + Al2CuMg

The EBSD maps along the x direction in the studied alloys and the inverse pole figures (IPF), are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the conventional casting alloys exhibit a dendritic morphology, while the alloy with Al-Ti-B present a certain grain refinement effect. It is worth nothing that USMP process produces an equiaxial and uniform fine grain structure (Fig. 3c and d). Moreover, the combined USMP and Al-Ti-B method exhibits the most grain refinement effect. This is in accordance with Ref. [64]. The mean grain size in 0.7Fe, 0.7FeB, 0.7FeU, and 0.7UB alloys are 118.5, 101.0, 65.7, and 46.0 μm, respectively. In the USMP process, a gradient of grain sizes is found from the horn to the bottom of the ingot. After USMP processing, the melt was not directly solidified in the clay crucible, but poured into the steel mould. So, we assumed that the melt is homogenously and samples are taken at the bottom place. An increase in Fe content from 0.7 % to 1.2 % increases the mean grain size, Fig. 3. This indicates that USMP is an effectively method for grain refinement, the higher refinement is found in the 1.2Fe alloy.Fig. 3The EBSD images and α-Al size distribution of different alloys: (a) 0.7Fe alloy; (b) 0.7FeB alloy; (c) 0.7FeU alloy; (d) 0.7FeUB alloy; (e) 1.2Fe alloy; (f) 1.2FeB alloy; (g) 1.2FeU alloy; (h) 1.2FeUB alloy.

Fig. 4 shows the OM images of the studied alloys under different manufacturing conditions. In the conventional alloys, dark-grey Fe-rich phases, white Al2Cu phases and medium-grey Mg2Si phases are distributed in the interdendritic regions. In the conventional alloys, the Fe-rich phases exhibit the Chinese-script and coarse structures (Fig. 4a and b). Al-Ti-B addition partially changed the morphology of Fe-rich phases to blocky or plate-like structures (Fig. 4c and d, as indicated by red arrows). This indicates that Al-Ti-B not only affects the grain size of α-Al, but also change the shape of Fe-rich phases. The USMP promotes a higher dispersion of Fe-rich phases (Fig. 4e and f). Moreover, the combined of USMP + Al-Ti-B process significantly refined the size of Fe-rich phases compared with individual processes (Fig. 4g and h).Fig. 4OM images of the alloys: (a) 0.7Fe alloy; (b) 1.2Fe alloy; (c) 0.7FeB alloy; (d) 1.2FeB alloy; (e) 0.7FeU alloy; (f) 1.2FeU alloy; (g) 0.7FeUB alloy; (h) 1.2FeUB alloy.

The identification of Fe-rich phases by their morphology can be misleading in some cases, as for example Al6(FeMn) and α-Fe. Thus, EDS mapping, point analysis, and Kikuchi patterns were used to identify these phases. The EDS element mapping of the four alloys produced without USMP are illustrated in Fig. 5. Fig. 5a shows the element distributions of Mg and Si (indicated by white circles). This phase is confirmed as Mg2Si, which coincide with the SEM analysis and thermodynamic calculations (Fig. 2). Also, traces of Si exist in the Al2Cu precipitates (see Fig. 5a-d). In addition, both the red and white dotted lines indicate the presence of Fe, but Si is only present in the region indicated by the red dotted line (Fig. 5a). The phase without Si is supposed to be Al6(FeMn), Fig. 5a). The phase with Si is confirmed to be α-Fe according to the element mapping [18]. In addition, the AlSiTi phase is found in the 0.7FeB alloy (Fig. 5b), which is consistent with the results shown in [39]. In the 1.2Fe alloy (Fig. 5c), Mg2Si (yellow dotted line) is also found through the coupled eutectic reaction with the Al2Cu phase. Similarly, the Fe-rich phases with and without Si are identified as α-Fe (white circle) and Al6(FeMn) respectively. In the 1.2FeB alloy (Fig. 5d), the Ti-containing particles are located in the Fe-rich phases, which allows to speculate that TiB2 particles are pushed into the interdendritic regions serving as heterogenous nucleation sites for Al3(FeMn) phases [19], [20].Fig. 5SEM images and EDS element mapping of the alloys without USMP: (a) 0.7Fe alloy; (b) 0.7FeB alloy; (c) 1.2Fe alloy; (d) 1.2FeB alloy.

The EDS element mapping of the two alloys with USMP are shown in Fig. 6. In 0.7Fe alloys, Fig. 6a and b, the presence of Mg2Si (white circle) together with Al2Cu is observed. The addition of Al-Ti-B does not modify the type of Fe-rich phases (Fig. 6b). In addition, some Si aggregates are found solubility into Al2Cu particles (red dotted line), which is agreed with our previous studies [15], [16]. The Ti containing particles (red circle) are located at the Al matrix, in accordance to the well accepted idea that the TiB2 particles serve as heterogenous nucleation sites for α-Al. USMP is an efficient method for reduce the segregation of TiB2 particles and promotes their heterogenous nucleation.Fig. 6The SEM images and EDS element mapping of the alloys with USMP: (a) 0.7FeU alloy; (b) 0.7FeUB alloy.
The identification of the type of intermetallic phases even with a combination of techniques as OM + SEM + EDS mapping, is very hard for some specific phases. Therefore, EBSD maps and Kikuchi patterns (Fig. 7) had been used to identify these Fe-rich phases. Al3(FeMn) is observed in the 0.7Fe and 1.2FeB alloys, Fig. 7a and d. However, as shown in Fig. 7b and c, Al6(FeMn) is observed in the 0.7FeB and 1.2Fe alloys. The Al3(FeMn) phases are also found in the 1.2FeUB alloy (Fig. 7e). The experimental Kikuchi patterns in Fig. 7a2 are shown in Fig. 7a4-7. The Al2Cu (MAD = 0.38, 95.3, 124.9, 37.8), Al7Cu2Fe (MAD = 0.81, 40.1, 63.2, 22.5), Al6(FeMn) (MAD = 0.54, 108.1, 34.8, 90.8), and Al3(FeMn) (MAD = 0.99, 69.0, 119.2, 230.8) phases are identified in the alloys.Fig. 7SEM images and EBSD phase mapping, Kikuchi patterns of different phase in the studied alloys: (a1-a3) 0.7Fe alloy; (b1-b3) 0.7FeB alloy; (c1-c3) 1.2Fe alloy; (d1-d3) 1.2FeB alloy; (e1-e3) 1.2FeUB alloy; (a4-a7, e4) Kikuchi patterns of different Fe-rich phases.

The solidification sequences of the studied alloys under different solidification conditions were analysed by DSC and cooling curves. Fig. 8 shows the effect of the Fe content on the DSC cooling curve. There are 5 exothermic peaks both in 0.7 % and 1.2 %Fe alloys. These peaks correspond to the formation of α-Al, Al3(FeMn)/Al6(FeMn), β-Fe/α-Fe, Al2Cu, and Mg2Si, respectively. In 0.7Fe alloy, the primary α-Al phases nucleated at 635 °C, followed by the peaks of Al3(FeMn)/Al6(FeMn) and β-Fe/α-Fe at 617 °C and 552 °C, respectively. Finally, the Al2Cu, and Mg2Si peaks appear at 517 °C and 509 °C, respectively. The USMP process and the addition of Al-Ti-B, both slightly modify the formation temperatures of the different phases. Such as, the formation temperatures of α-Al, Al6(FeMn), Al2Cu, and Mg2Si increase by 4, 4, 4, and 1 °C, respectively. In the 1.2Fe alloys, the formation temperatures of α-Al, Al3(FeMn), Al6(FeMn), Al2Cu, and Mg2Si are 637, 625, 559, 513, and 508 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the Al-Ti-B addition and USMP in 1.2 %Fe alloy also modify the intermetallic formation temperatures. The formation temperatures of the intermetallic phases generated in different conditions are summarized in Table 3.Fig. 8The DSC cooling curve (10 °C/min) of different alloys under different conditions: (a) 0.7Fe alloy; (b) 1.2Fe alloy.Table 3The nucleation temperature of different phases measured by DSC (Fig. 8) and cooling curve (CC) (Fig. 9).

The cooling curves taken during solidification are shown in Fig. 9. The formation temperatures are obtained from the first-order derivative of the cooling curves. As can be seen in Fig. 9, the maximum undercooling of α-Al is greatly reduced by the Al-Ti-B addition and USMP both in the 0.7Fe and 1.2Fe alloys. Such as, the formation temperature of α-Al in 1.2Fe alloy is 636 °C; while this temperature in the 1.2FeU alloy is 649 °C. The primary α-Al phase nucleation temperature under USMP is not clearly in the recorded cooling curves. This is due to the USMP temperature is 710 °C and the melt temperature is about 695 °C after 5 min. The melt temperature is close to the liquidus temperature when the melt was poured into the steel mould. The first-order derivative of the cooling curves also shows five exothermic peaks corresponding to the five solidification reactions (Fig. 9c). Fig. 9d shows the schematic diagram used to calculate the nucleation temperature of the different phases. It is also evidenced that the heterogeneous nucleation of TiB2 and the strong effect of acoustic streaming and cavitation affect the formation temperatures of Fe-rich phases, Al2Cu and Mg2Si. The nucleation temperature of different phases measured by DSC and cooling curve are presented in Table 3. Based on the above analysis of DSC (Fig. 8) and cooling curves (Fig. 9), the possible solidification reactions for both alloys are listed in Table 4.Fig. 9The cooling curve measured during solidification of different alloys: (a) 0.7Fe alloy; (b) 1.2Fe alloy; (c) the first-order derivative of the cooling curves; (d) the schematic diagram used to calculate the nucleation, undercooling and growth temperature.Table 4The possible solidification reactions in the studied alloys.ReactionsTemperature range (°C)1L → α-Al / L → Al3(FeMn)635–6542L → α-Al + Al3(FeMn)/Al6(FeMn)613–6313L + Al3(FeMn)/Al6(FeMn) → α-Al + β-Fe/α-Fe548–5804L → α-Al + β-Fe + Al2Cu513–5245L → α-Al + Al2CuMg + Al2Cu + Mg2Si504–513

In order to study the effect of USMP + Al-Ti-B process on the Fe-rich phases size in different alloys, the area of single Fe-rich phases is shown in Fig. 10. The image binarization in OM images were conducted according to their colour, Fig. 10 a and b. The binarization process was performed by the ImageJ software. The total threshold value is 0–255, the criteria for Fe-rich phases (white colour) is 93–255. The area size distributions are shown in Fig. 10 c and d. At least 30 images were used for the statistical analysis. Hence, the USMP + Al-Ti-B process refine the size of single Fe-rich particles in comparison with individual methods.Fig. 10Example of Fe-rich phases distribution images: (a) original image; (b) binarized image (The threshold value, 93–255, has been determined by ImageJ software).

The 3D morphology of Fe-rich phases is also influenced by the Fe content and processing methods of the studied alloys, as demonstrated in Fig. 11. In conventional casting sample (Fig. 11a and e), coarse and fine dendritic Fe-rich phases are observed. As shown in Fig. 11b and c, the Fe-rich phases in 0.7FeB and 0.7FeU alloys are better dispersed. In Fig. 11d, it is shown that the size of Fe-rich phases in 0.7FeUB alloy is refined compared with individual methods. However, the morphology of Fe-rich phases in 1.2Fe alloys is more disperse with skeleton structure (Fig. 11e-h).Fig. 11The deep-etched morphologies of Fe-rich phases in different alloys: (a, e) conventional alloy; (b, f) Al-Ti-B alloy; (c, g) USMP alloy; (d, h) USMP + Al-Ti-B alloy; (a-d) 0.7Fe alloy; (e-h) 1.2Fe alloy.

It is universally acknowledged that the Al-Ti-B grain refiner have a good grain refinement of α-Al, as TiB2 particles can serve as heterogenous nucleation sites for α-Al [66], [67]. The solute element, and melt process parameters have a strong influence on alloy's grain size. The growth restriction factor (GRF) is calculated by Equation (1), Q represent the growth restriction degree obtained for a multiphase alloy upon solidification [68].(1)Q=∑jmjkj-1Cjwhere mj is the liquidus line slope on the different equilibrium binary phase diagram, and kj are the equilibrium distribution coefficient and Cj is the solute concentration of element j, respectively. The value of liquidus line slope (mj) and equilibrium distribution coefficient (kj) for different elements are listed in Table S1.
The relationship between the grain size (d) and 1/Q in solidified alloys with and without USMP is calculated by equation [69]:(2)d=a+b*1/Qwhere a and b are constants. The values of 1/Q in the 0.7Fe, 0.7FeB, 0.7FeU, and 0.7FeUB alloys are 0.056, 0.013, 0.054, and 0.015, respectively; and the calculated d is 118.5, 101.0, 65.7, 46.0 um, respectively. The relationship between 1/Q and grain size of the studied alloys are plotted in Fig. 12. A clear contribution of the UMSP and Al-Ti-B addition contribution to the grain refinement can be seen in Fig. 12. However, the combination of UMSP and Al-Ti-B have a better grain refinement efficiency, with the 0.7Fe alloy presenting the smallest grain size. An increase in the Fe content from 0.7 % to 1.2 % increases the grain size. The specific relations found in the present case are d = 87 + 1000*1/Q for alloys with USMP, and d = 37 + 537*1/Q for alloys without USMP (see Fig. 12).Fig. 12The relationship between the grain size and 1/Q in alloys solidified without and with USMP.
It is interesting to note that the USMP process have a higher refinement efficiency compared to Al-Ti-B. This is due to the agglomeration tendency of TiB2 particles in the Al melts [19], [20], that greatly decreases their grain refinement efficiency. It is widely accepted that the USMP process produces the effects of acoustic cavitation and acoustic streaming. The ultrasonic intensity I is calculated by [43], [44]:(3)I=12∗ρc(2πfA)2
The density ρ of molten Al at 700 °C is 2.4 kg/m3, the sound velocity c in liquid Al at 700 °C is 4.6 × 103 m/s, the ultrasonic vibration frequency f is 20 kHz and the applied amplitude A is estimated to be 20 μm. Thus, the calculated ultrasonic intensity I in the current study is approximately 875 W/cm2, which is higher than the threshold value required producing acoustic cavitation in molten Al (100 W/cm2) [44].
USMP is one of the most effective methods for grain refinement during solidification of alloys [44], [45]. Various mechanisms have been established based on the in-situ studies [46], [47], [48] and post-mortem experiments [49], [50], [51], [52] to justify its influence on alloy refinement. The different refinement mechanisms are mainly related to the melt temperature: 1) above the liquidus temperature and 2) temperature between liquidus and solid temperature (semi-solid temperature zone). When the melt temperature is above the liquidus temperature, the cavitation-enhanced grain nucleation and cavitation-enhanced inclusion nucleation are the two main mechanisms [44], [46]. When the cavitation bubbles reach the negative pressure, the bubbles will implosion and generate a very high local pressure (up to several GPa). The pressure will be resulting in the high local undercooling, which facilitates the solid nucleus generation and promotes the homogenous nucleation. This is the main mechanism for grain refinement. Moreover, the cavitation improves the wetting of inclusions (so-called sonocapillary effect), which promote these inclusions for heterogenous nucleation sites for primary α-Al phases. The second mechanism of the grain refinement is cavitation induced-dendrite fragmentation in the semi-solid temperature zone. After the primary phases are formed, the cavitation bubbles continually attacked the growing dendrite phases and resulting in the fatigue fracture. These fragment dendrites will be grown up as the new grains. This phenomenon had been clearly observed by the high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging [45], [46], [47].
In the present case, the USMP temperature for both melts are 710 °C, which is higher than the liquidus temperature of the alloys. This ensures that the USMP force the wetting of TiB2 particles which is the main mechanisms for heterogenous nucleation. The bubbles generated by acoustic cavitation continuously broke the agglomerated TiB2 clusters and the acoustic streaming homogeneously distributes these deagglomerated TiB2 parties in the Al melts. Thus, the greater the heterogeneity in nucleation, the greater the decrease in the nucleation undercooling of α-Al (Table 2). For example, the nucleation temperature for α-Al in 0.7Fe alloy for the conventional alloy, with Al-Ti-B, USMP, and combined USMP and Al-Ti-B is 635, 640, 646, and 654 °C, respectively. Hence, both and USMP and Al-Ti-B reduce the nucleation undercooling similarly with the Ref. [65].
The Fe-rich phases in 0.7Fe and 1.2Fe alloys are formed through different solidification reaction, so USMP and Al-Ti-B have different effect on them. The refinement mechanism of Fe-rich phases is based on the melt temperature and solidification stage. As shown in Fig. 2, Al3(FeMn), Al6(FeMn) and α-Fe phases in 0.7Fe alloy are mostly formed through eutectic or peritectic reaction; while only a very small volume fraction of Al3(FeMn) phases in 1.2Fe alloy are formed through prior to the α-Al. The Fe-rich phases in different alloys are different. The calculated vertical section phase diagram of Al-4.5Cu-0.5Mn-0.5Mg-0.2Si-xFe (x = 0–2) alloys is presented in Fig. 2c. It can be seen that the Fe-rich phases are mostly formed through the eutectic reaction in 0.7Fe alloy; while a small proportion of primary Al3(FeMn) phases are formed in the 1.2Fe alloy and this can be ignored. So, we similarly regard that the 0.7Fe and 1.2Fe alloys have the same mechanism. The main refinement mechanism for Fe-rich phases is the ‘liquid pocket’ mechanism due to the refined interderdendritic regions have narrow room for the eutectic reaction. As the Fe content increases, the percentage of Al3(FeMn) phase also increases. Due to the equilibrium phase diagram, the metastable Al6(FeMn) phases is not found in the system.
Fig. S3 presents the XRD patterns of the deep-etched 0.7Fe and 1.2Fe alloys with Al-Ti-B addition and USMP processing. The deep-etched process reduces the intensity of α-Al and increases the relative intensity of the intermetallic particles. It can be seen that α-Al, Al3(FeMn), Al6(FeMn), α-Fe, and Al2Cu phases are co-existed in both 0.7Fe and 1.2Fe alloys. Al6(FeMn) and α-Fe are the main Fe-rich phases in 0.7Fe alloy, while relatively intensity of Al3(FeMn) and Al6(FeMn) are increased in 1.2Fe alloys. If the Fe content increases from 0.7 to 1.2 %, the type of Fe-rich phases does not change, the main Fe-rich phases change from Al6(FeMn) and α-Fe to Al3(FeMn) and Al6(FeMn). Moreover, the Al-Ti-B promotes the formation of Al3(FeMn) in 1.2Fe alloy, which is maybe due to the low crystal misfit between TiB2 and Al3(FeMn) phases (Fig. 4c and d).
The size of the Fe-rich phases is greatly influenced by the USMP processing and the Al-Ti-B addition. The refined size of Fe-rich phases, Fig. 11, under USMP + Al-Ti-B is due to the formation of Fe-rich phases after the α-Al. The narrow and refined secondary interdendritic regions limit their growth. The refinement of Fe-rich phases is related to the α-Al grain size reduction in the studied processes. Due to the USMP temperature is above the its liquidus temperature, and wetting and deagglomerated TiB2 particles induced by USMP are the main reason for dispersion of Fe-rich phases. For example, the nucleation temperature for Al3(FeMn) or Al6(FeMn) phases in 1.2Fe, 1.2FeB, 1.2FeU and 1.2FeUB alloys are 625, 628, 628, and 631 °C, respectively. This indicates that both USMP and Al-Ti-B increases the nucleation temperature of these Fe-rich phases and also, the USMP process deagglomerates the TiB2 particles that are pushed into the liquidus/solid interface and subsequently engulfed into the residual liquid serving as heterogeneously distributed nucleation sites for Fe-rich phases. On the other hand, the nucleation rate around the location of collapsed cavitation bubbles would significantly increase. This reduces the critical nucleation radius and promote the nucleation rates.
Also, it should be mentioned that the USMP processing also influences shape and distribution of the Fe-rich in the Al alloys, Fig. 11. The acoustic streaming and bubbles generation by USMP process homogenize the solute elements and improves the Fe-rich phase dispersion. Also, TiB2 particles in the Al-Ti-B-containing alloys act as heterogeneous nucleation sites for Fe-rich phases [20], [21]. In the 0.7FeUB and 1.2FeUB alloys, the acoustic streaming uniformly distributes the TiB2 particles and solutes elements, which promotes a heterogeneously nucleation in the narrow α-Al interdendritic region.
Finally, the 3D morphology and distribution of Fe-rich phases is also influenced by the Fe content and processing of the studied alloys, Fig. 11. The Fe-rich phases in 0.7FeB and 0.7FeU alloys are better dispersed, because the USMP disperse the Fe-rich phases and TiB2 promotes a heterogeneous nucleation. However, the morphology of Fe-rich phases in 1.2Fe alloys is more disperse with skeleton structure (Fig. 11e-h) due to the high content of Fe in the residual liquid at the last solidification stage to form Fe-rich phases. Al-Ti-B increases the nucleation temperature of Fe-rich phases, providing them more space to growth and impinge. The acoustic bubbles induced by USMP can deagglomeration, and fragmentation the dendrite and intermetallic phases; acoustic streaming can wet the nucleate substrate and promote the nucleation. Acoustic streaming can promote the equiaxed crystal and reduces the temperature gradient in the melt, in which the deagglomerates TiB2 particles provided more effective nucleation sites for grain refinement. As the Fe content increases, Fe solute are rejecting into the interdendritic regions at the solid/liquid front resulting in constitutional undercooling, this also promotes the nucleation of Fe-rich phases.
The microstructural evolution during solidification of Al-4.5Cu-0.5Mn-0.5Mg-0.2Si-xFe alloys (x = 0.7, and 1.2 wt%) under gravity casting, USMP, Al-Ti-B and USMP + Al-Ti-B is comparatively studied by OM, SEM, EBSD, thermodynamic calculation, DSC, and thermal analysis. The main conclusions are listed as below:
1). The combination of USMP and Al-Ti-B methods produces a higher grain refinement effect compared with the individual methods. The main reason for refinement is that USMP deagglomerates the TiB2 clusters, which providing more effective nucleation sites for α-Al. The averaged grain size is reduced by a 61 % in the 0.7Fealloy. In the 1.2Fe alloys, combined USMP and Al-Ti-B methods produce even a higher refinement effect (80 %).
2). The Fe-rich phases in both alloys with USMP + Al-Ti-B are refined and more homogenous distributed compared with conventional methods. As the USMP temperature is above the liquidus temperature of the studied alloys which generates the acoustic streaming during the process acting as the main refinement mechanism. The deagglomerated TiB2 particles are pushed into the refined interdendritic regions limiting the growth of Fe-rich phases in the following eutectic reaction.
3). The acoustic cavitation produced by the USMP processing increases the equilibrium freezing point. This promotes the wetting of the TiB2 particles providing heterogeneous nucleation sites. Moreover, the TiB2 particles are the ideal nucleation sites for α-Al and unused TiB2 particles are pushed into the interdentric regions and serves nucleation sites for Fe-rich phases.

Hepatocellular carcinoma, with a 5-year survival rate lower than 18%,1–3 is one of the most prevalent causal factors of cancer deaths worldwide. Due to the absence of early diagnosis and effective treatment, most patients lost the chance of radical cure due to the advanced-stage diagnosis.4,5 Due to either low sensitivity or inadequate penetration depth, the early sensitive diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinoma (SHCC) is still challenging in clinic. Ultrasound (US) imaging, X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are commonly used in clinical practice to image solid tumors in deep tissues.6–8 However, these technologies are not sensitive enough to detect millimeter-sized SHCC lesions. Optical imaging has received broad attention for its biosafety, high sensitivity, and molecular imaging capabilities, which enables accurate diagnosis of early-stage HCC.
Recently, near-infrared (NIR) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) have been developed for early tumor detection and diagnosis.9–12 Because PAI offers high imaging resolution in deep tissue and FLI provides high imaging sensitivity, the combination of the two modalities can accurately detect exogenous and endogenous contrasts including oxygen saturation, lipids, hemoglobin concentration, and a variety of molecules and nanoparticles.13–17 Meanwhile, due to the high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) and efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation of some optical contrast agents, the combination of photothermal therapy (PTT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be readily co-implemented under the real-time guidance by optical imaging, which provides an excellent adjuvant strategy to efficient ablation and hypoxia amelioration for tumor treatment.18–22
Unfortunately, limited kinds of nano-agents are practicable to achieve the precision diagnosis and phototherapeutic for SHCC. It is noteworthy that studies based on orthotopic tumors are limited, primarily because of the insufficient penetration or undesirable biocompatibility of contrast agents. To thoroughly evaluate the potential preclinical exploration of therapeutic approaches, the therapeutic performance of nanomedicines in the orthotopic-tumor model is strongly needed. Up to now most optical contrast agents including NIR small molecule dyes, carbon-based nanomaterials and plasmonic noble metal nanoparticles, may cause long-lasting residual systemic toxicity and thus hinder clinical transformation.23–26 Indocyanine green (ICG) is the most commonly used NIR fluorescent dye and photosensitizer, widely used in clinical surgical navigation, which has been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA).27 Although ICG fluorescence imaging demonstrates superior imaging sensitivity, it does not achieve high resolution in deep tissue, limiting its application in clinic.28,29 By realizing the illuminating effect of label-free photo-theranostics of melanoma, melanin derivatives (polydopamine, PDA) nano-agent has exhibited viable PAI and PTT performances with superior biocompatibility.30–32 Hence, ICG-doped PDA-based nano-agents are suitable for photoacoustic (PA)-fluorescence (FL) dual-modality imaging for tumor detection and treatment.
Herein, we synthesize a biocompatible and multifunctional theranostic nano-agent for NIR optical imaging guidance and phototheranostics of early-stage orthotopic HCC (Figure 1). Via doping Platinum (Pt) and Indocyanine green (ICG) during the formation of PDA nanoparticles, a blackbody-like NIR optical imaging and phototherapeutic agent (namely ICG/Pt@PDA, IPP) was synthesized with a superior PCE of 58.7% (excitation at 808 nm). Subsequently, sulfhydryl polyethylene glycol (SH-PEG) and anti-CXCR4 were modified on the surface of IPP to form an HCC-targeting nanoparticle (designated ICG/Pt@PDA-PEG-CXCR4, referred to as IPP-c). As CXCR4 modified in IPP-c is a highly expressed marker on the surface of HCC, which is expected to achieve active targeting of HCC via CXCR4-recognization. The HepG2 cellular uptake experiments preliminary verified the targeted accumulation properties of IPP-c NPs in vitro. In particular, IPP-c mediated photoacoustic-fluorescence dual-modality imaging demonstrated deep tissue penetration and high resolution to locate early-stage (diameter less than 1.2 mm) orthotopic SHCC which has been previously confirmed by the optical-resolution photoacoustic microscope (OR-PAM) imaging system. In vivo PTT/PDT experiments guided by PAI/FLI show that SHCC can be integrally ablated with recurrence-free and microlesion to normal liver tissue. After treatment, IPP-c can be metabolized in major organs in 48 hours, showing reliable biosecurity. Our work represents an important development in photodiagnosis and phototherapeutic for early-stage orthotopic HCC based on the nano-agent IPP-c, which encourages further applications in clinic.Figure 1(A) The preparation of a biocompatible and multifunctional theranostic nano-agent (IPP-c NPs).

All chemicals needed for the synthesis of IPP-c nanoparticles (NPs) were commercially purchased and could be used without any refinement unless otherwise noted. Dopamine-hydrochloride (DA-HCl), K2PtCl4 and Indocyanine green (ICG) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China). The sulphydryl polyethylene glycol (PEG-SH, 5 KDa) was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). The anti-CXCR4 (ab208128) was bought from Abcam (Shanghai, China). The cell culture medium, PBS, trypsin and MTT kit were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Hong Kong, China). Matrigel® Matrix was bought from Becton Dickinson (America). D-Luciferin was obtained from Gold Biotechnology (America). The synthesis process of IPP-c NPs was shown in the Supporting Information.
The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum of IPP-c NPs was tested by a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The morphology was captured using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Philips Tecnai 12, 120 kV, Netherland). The Zeta potential and hydration particle size were measured by Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, USA). The fluorescent spectrum was tested by a spectrofluorometer (Hitachi, Japan). The NIR images of temperature variation were captured by a thermal imager (FLIR one pro, USA).
A lab-built photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) system33 was used for in vivo and in vitro photoacoustic imaging (PAI) (Figure S1, Supporting Information). An optical parametric oscillator system pumped by A Nd: YAG laser system unit emits 6~9 ns width laser pulses with a 20Hz pulse repetition rate, and its wavelength can be tuned from 400 to 2000 nm. According to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) safety limit, the laser energy was set at 4.5 mJ·cm−2 at 808-nm wavelength. Photoacoustic (PA) signals were received with a linear array transducer, and then digitalized by an ultrasound system. The US/PA images were reconstructed using a back-projection method.9 An optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) system34 built in the lab was used for PA imaging in vivo (Figure S2, Supporting Information). A 532-nm pulsed laser with 7-ns pulse width and 4-kHz repetition rate was used in experiments. The laser pulse energy was 75 nJ. Maximum-amplitude-projection (MAP) images were acquired via raster scanning.
The aqueous solutions of IPP-c NPs with various concentrations (0 ~ 0.5 mg mL−1) were pre-sealed in different rubber capillaries. The PA signal and quantitative analysis for each sample was detected by the PACT system upon an 808-nm laser irradiation. Meanwhile, the PA stability for IPP-c NPs was tested using the PACT system after laser irradiation for 0s to 1500s. Then, the aqueous solutions of IPP-c NPs with the concentration of 0 mg mL−1 to 0.5 mg mL−1 were sealed in a 96-well plate. Fluorescent signal of IPP-c NPs was tested and quantified using an in vivo Xtreme live animal imaging system. The excitation (ex.) wavelength was 650 nm and the emission (em.) wavelength was 800 nm.
The human HCC cells (HepG2 and LM3 cells) and the normal human hepatocyte LO2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cells were cultured in 89% Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) mixed with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 at a temperature of 37°C). To get the TEM images of HepG2 cells, the cells were mixed with IPP-c NPs and incubated for 4h, then cellular copper mesh was prepared and tested by TEM. To obtain the cellular confocal images, the HepG2 cells were implanted in a laser confocal dish and cultured for 24 h. Subsequently, the medium mixed with IPP-c NPs (0.4mg mL−1) were transferred to a petri dish and incubated for another 1, 2, and 4 hours. As a control, LO2 cell lines incubated with IPP-c NPs for 4 h. Then, we removed the NPs medium mixture, fixed it with paraformaldehyde (4%, 500 µL, 10 min), and stained the cell nucleus with DAPI (1.5 µg mL−1, 12 min). We used PBS to wash the dish after each step (1 mL, 3 times, 10 min). The cellular fluorescent images were observed by a confocal microscopy (Leica, Germany).
To estimate the toxicity of IPP-c NPs in dark conditions, a MTT cytotoxicity test was carried out. A proper dose of HepG2 cells and LM3 cells were implanted in a respective 96-well plate and incubated for 24 hours, then transferred the medium with varying concentrations of medium-NPs mixture (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 mg mL−1) and cultivated for the next 24 hours in dark conditions. Subsequently, removed the medium-NPs mixture, added MTT to each test well and incubated for another 3 hours. Then, replaced with the same amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Finally, a microplate reader was applied to test the absorbance in each well at 570 nm. The final results were averaged from three repeated experiments.
The singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) was used as a 1O2 detection probe to verify the photoswitchable PDT of IPP-c NPs, and the fluorescence intensity of SOSG in with or without laser group reflected the level of 1O2 in each group. Meanwhile, 1,3-Diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) in ethanol mixed with IPP-c, ICG and PBS were irradiated with 808-nm laser (about 5 minutes), and the consumption of DPSF can reflect the ROS production and PDT performance. The aqueous solutions of IPP-c NPs with different concentrations (from 0 to 0.4 mg mL−1) were filled into quartz colorimetric dishes. The temperature changes of these samples were imaged and recorded by a FLIR camera every 30 seconds under 808-nm laser irradiation (0.8W·cm−2). The laser was turned on/off (temperature reached equilibrium/cooled naturally to room temperature) for five cycles to detect the photothermal stability of IPP-c NPs. The HepG2 cells and LM3 cells were implanted in a 96-well plate, respectively, and then cultured for 24 hours. Medium containing IPP-c NPs (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg mL−1) were used instead of medium and incubated for the next 4 hours. These samples were irradiated with an 808-nm laser for 8 minutes and incubated for another 24 hours in dark conditions, and cell survival rate in each sample was measured by the MTT cell viability assay. To verify the cellular PDT performance of IPP-c, the HepG2 cells were seeded in different laser confocal dishes and cultured for 24 hours. The medium mixed with IPP-c NPs (0.4 mg mL−1) /ICG were replaced and incubated for the next 4 hours, and each sample in laser group was irradiated with an 808-nm laser for 10 minutes while the non-laser groups without laser irradiation. The production of ROS was detected by the DCFH-DA kit, and the cell images in each group were acquired using a confocal microscope. In order to directly reflect the survival state of cells, the HepG2 cells and LM3 cells were implanted into different dishes and cultivated for 24 hours, and then replaced medium containing IPP-c NPs and incubated for the next 4 hours. Subsequently, the sample in Laser + IPP/IPP-c/PBS group was exposured with an 808-nm laser for 10 minutes while the IPP-c/PBS group was not irradiated. After that, these samples were dyed with Calcein-AM and propidium iodide (PI) for 15 minutes and the cell fluorescent images were taken by a fluorescence microscope.
The orthotopic tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice were used for in vivo and ex vivo PAI. After anesthesia, the IPP-c NPs (25 mg·kg−1)/ICG were injected into the nude mice via the tail vein. The PACT system was applied to detect the images of IPP-c NPs/ICG gathering and quantify the signal from the tumor region in 0~24 hours after injection. To further determine the location and accuracy of the tumor, we performed laparotomy in the mice to fully expose the liver tumor area. The label-free OR-PAM system was used to image the normal liver region and the tumor region (wavelength 532 nm, laser energy 75 nJ).
All the experimental animals were purchased and fed in the Laboratory Animal Research Unit (LARU) of the City University of Hong Kong. All animal procedures were performed according to the animal handling and care guidelines formulated by LARU of City University of Hong Kong and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the and Department of Health in Hong Kong (20–201 in DH/HT&A/8/2/5 Pt.3). The orthotopic tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice were used for in vivo and ex vivo FLI. After anesthesia, IPP-c NPs (25 mg·kg−1)/ICG was injected into the orthotopic SHCC tumor-bearing mice via tail vein. Subsequently, the in vivo Xtreme live animal imaging system was used to image and quantitate the time of IPP-c NPs signal accumulation and excretion in tumor region and blood circulation of mice. At the IPP-c NPs accumulation time point detected by the in vivo PAI and FLI, the mice were executed via cervical dislocation, and the tumors and other major organs (including liver, spleen, heart, lungs, and kidneys) were resected and ex vivo imaging was performed by the fluorescent imaging system.
The orthotopic tumor-bearing BALB/c nude mice were used in in vivo PTT/PDT experiments. Before the studies, the SHCCs formation in all mice was validated by the in vivo bioluminescence imaging system, and then the mice were categorized into four treatment groups (Laser + IPP-c/PBS group and IPP-c/PBS group). In the Laser + IPP-c/IPP-c group, IPP-c NPs (25 mg·kg−1) were injected intravenously, and same amount of PBS was injected in the Laser + PBS/PBS group. At the IPP-c NPs accumulation time point which was confirmed previously, in the laser treatment groups, the 808-nm laser (0.8W·cm−2) was used to irradiate the liver tumor areas for 12 minutes in the mice which were fully exposed by the laparotomy, while the other two groups without irradiation. All surgical procedures strictly followed the principle of sterility to prevent perioperative death of mice due to severe infection. The temperature variation changes in tumor regions was imaged by a FLIR camera during the PTT/PDT treatment. After that, the bioluminescence imaging of the mice in groups were detected and quantitated by an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system on the day 7 and day 14 posttreatment. The general assessment and body weights of mice in all groups were detected every two days. At 15 days posttreatment, the mice in all groups were executed by cervical dislocation, and the treated tumors and other major organs were excised for further histological analysis (H&E staining).
The ex vivo PA imaging of the major organs (including liver, spleen, heart, lung, and kidney) were measured by the PACT system 24, 36, and 48 hours postinjection to verify the clearance ability of IPP-c NPs in blood flow of mice body. Moreover, to assess the biosafety of IPP-c NPs and the phototherapy in mice of all groups, the blood of mice in each group was collected through the tail vein 15 days posttreatment, and the blood routine and biochemistry tests were carried out and the results were averaged.
As illustrated in Figure 1, via reaction process modulation by ICG/Pt precursor and anti-CXCR4 loaded on the surface, a multifunctional targeted polydopamine nanoparticle (designated ICG/Pt@PDA-PEG-CXCR4, referred to as IPP-c) was applied to photoacoustic/fluorescence imaging and imaging-guided targeted phototherapeutic applications (Figure 1). The TEM imaging presents that the size of IPP-c was about 85 ~ 100 nm (Figure 2A), which was similar to the size (85.0 ± 15.3 nm) tested by DLS (Figure 2B). The zeta potential of IPP and IPP-c is −39.2 ± 5.8 mV and −36.2 ± 5.3 mV, respectively. The changes in the zeta potential indicate that anti-CXCR4 was electrostatically adsorbed by IPP nanoparticles (Figure 2C). Meanwhile, the difference of fluorescent spectra between IPP and IPP-c further demonstrates the successful connecting of positively charged anti-CXCR4 via the method of electrostatic adsorption (Figure 2D). The loading amount of antibody of around 1.6% by weight, which is calculated by fluorescent pec (Figure S3, Supporting Information). These studies also confirmed the successful connection of anti-CXCR4 of IPP NPs. The UV-NIR spectra of IPP-c and PDA nanoparticles indicate that IPP-c exhibited two NIR absorption peaks at 725 nm and 808 nm, while PDA absorption decreases sharply with increased wavelength (Figure 2E), which confirmed that ICG has been successfully wrapped by Pt@PDA NPs. Moreover, the NIR absorption of IPP-c increased gradually with the increase of concentration (Figure 2F). As reported, ICG small molecule itself has strong optical absorption, but its fluorescence quenching property limits its clinical application.35,36 However, IPP-c prevents its fluorescence quenching by wrapping PDA, so it has good in vitro and in vivo optical theranostic performance after confirming its stability. In summary, IPP-c has a suitable particle size and good NIR absorption for optical imaging.Figure 2(A) TEM images of IPP-c NPs. (B) DLS size distribution of IPP-c NPs (The mean size is 85 nm).

The serum stability of the nano-agent is critical for further biomedical diagnostic and therapeutic applications, which mainly reflects in the changes of optical absorption (detected by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy) and particle size (tested by DLS). As shown in Figure 3A and B, IPP-c NPs could be well dispersed under various liquids (DI water, Serum, PBS and DMEM) and did not demonstrate any significant change in 808-nm absorption when stored at 4°C for 72 hours, and no distinct particle size change was observed when stored at 37°C for 72 hours to simulate the physiological environment. However, the free ICG demonstrated a significantly reduced absorption at 808-nm, probably due to its unstable decomposition (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Hence, IPP-c NPs demonstrate satisfactory stability in biological fluids and therefore can be used for further biomedical applications.Figure 3(A) Serum stability test of IPP-c NPs measured for 48 hours and the photos of NPs in different solvents.

IPP-c NPs have strong NIR absorption capacity and are suitable for NIR PAI. The PACT system was applied to image IPP-c NPs in vitro. As shown in Figure 3D, the PA intensity and its quantitative analysis present a proportional relationship (R2 = 0.9735) with the concentrations of IPP-c NPs (0 ~ 0.5 mg mL−1) at an 808-nm wavelength and 4.5-mJ·cm−2 fluence. Subsequently, the PA stability test indicates a reliable photostability of IPP-c NPs with no obvious PA signal change (detected by PACT system) after exposure to an intensive 808-nm laser (20 pulses per second, 4.5 mJ·cm−2 fluence) for 1500 seconds (Figures 3C). Moreover, the successfully wrapped ICG in IPP-c NPs has a good signal for fluorescence imaging. The fluorescence intensity and its quantitative analysis measured by the in vivo Xtreme live animal imaging system are shown in Figure 3E. Excited with a 650-nm laser, IPP-c demonstrates a superior FL signal at 820-nm, which presents a proportional relationship (R2 = 0.9819) between the FL signal and the concentration of IPP-c NPs (from 0 to 0.5 mg mL−1). The strong PA/FL signal and good photostability in vitro demonstrated the successful synthesis of IPP-c NPs, which encouraged its further biological applications in vivo.
Furthermore, the NIR PTT/PDT performance of IPP-c NPs was investigated before in vivo applications. The PDT performance of IPP-c was verified by the SOSG 1O2 detection probe and DPBF consumption test, the adequate production of ROS and sufficient DPBF degradation indicate the excellent PDT performance of IPP-c NPs (Figure 3F and G). As shown in Figures 3H and S5 in the Supporting Information, the temperature of IPP-c NPs solutions with various concentrations (from 0 to 0.4 mg mL−1) rose to different values after laser irradiation. The temperature in a concentration of 0.4 mg·mL−1 group rose from 25°C to 48.5°C upon 808-nm laser irradiation for 10 minutes (energy: 0.8W·cm−2), while the temperature of DI water only increased by 5.5°C upon similar laser exposure pathway. Furthermore, the PTT stability of IPP-c NPs was verified by three laser on/off cycles test (Figure 3I) and morphological changes test (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information, test by TEM) presented no noticeable attenuation of temperature or any morphological changes, which demonstrates great photothermal stability. As shown in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information, through linear regression of IPP-c and DI Water for determination of time constant, the PCE of IPP-c NPs was 58.7% (calculated from an accepted method in the Supporting Information), which is superior among other organic and inorganic materials37–44 (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The strong photothermal conversion behavior of IPP-c may be due to the non-irradiation process of the non-fluorescent melanin-derived material. The doped ICG/Pt with superior optical absorption also contributes to the electron/charge transfer process, with superior photothermal properties comparable to CuS NPs and polypyrrole NPs.45,46 IPP-c with a dependable PA/FL signal, good photostability, and high PCE encourages further PAI/FLI and PTT/PDT studies in vitro and in vivo.
In previous studies,47–49 the CXCR4 protein has been confirmed to be highly expressed in the cell membrane of human HCC cells, such as HepG2 and LM3 cells. Hence, the CXCR4-overexpressing HepG2 and LM3 cells can ingest the IPP-c NPs actively, which was confirmed by the following in vitro experiments. The cellular TEM/CLSM imaging presented in Figures 4A and S8 (Supporting Information) indicate that most IPP-c NPs accumulated in the membrane and cytoplasm of the HepG2 cells, and gradually increased with incubation times (1 ~ 4 hours). As a control, LO2 cell lines incubated with IPP-c NPs for 4 h showed very little targeted uptake (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). Hence, with a particular uptake capacity by HCC cells, IPP-c is ideal for optical imaging-guided targeted tumor diagnosis and treatment in vivo.Figure 4(A) Cellular TEM images of HepG2 cells incubated with the IPP-c NPs.

Cell dark toxicity was studied to verify the biosafety of IPP-c NPs. As illustrated in Figure 4C, after incubation with IPP-c NPs (0.8 mg mL−1) for 24h in dark conditions, the viabilities of HepG2 and LM3 cells were above 92.1% and 90.2%, respectively, indicating negligible cytotoxicity. Subsequently, a cell phototoxicity test was carried out to confirm the PTT/PDT performance of IPP-c NPs upon an 808-nm laser exposure for 8 minutes with an energy of 0.8W·cm−2. Figure 4B reflects the ROS generation properties of IPP-c and ICG upon 808-nm laser irradiation detected by DCFH-DA probe. In laser irradiation group, the cells presented strong fluorescence signal of DCF in IPP-c group, while almost no fluorescence signal was detected in the ICG group and other no laser irradiation groups, indicating superior cellular PDT performance. Figure 4D shows that with the increase of NPs concentration, the survival ability of HepG2 and LM3 cells were declined gradually, and the viability of the cells were about 3.8% (HepG2 cells) and 6.5% (LM3 cells) after laser irradiation (NPs-0.8 mg mL−1), respectively, demonstrating superior phototoxicity. The photothermal effects of HepG2 and LM3 cells were visually presented by the Calcein-AM and PI co-staining tests. The results are shown in Figure 4E. In both HepG2 and LM3 cell groups, strong green fluorescence signals (standing for living cells) were observed after treating with PBS, Laser and IPP-c, and most of the green fluorescence and a small part of the red fluorescence (standing for dead cells) were noticed after treating with Laser + IPP, whereas strong red fluorescence signals were detected after treating with Laser + IPP-c. These results indicate that a suitable laser strength can achieve a reliable targeted PTT/PDT of HCC cells with the targeted IPP-c. Based on its cellular targeting ability, low-toxicity, and targeted PTT/PDT properties, IPP-c is considered to be a reliable specific theranostic agent for HCC.
To verify the size of SHCC and the differentiation of tumor boundaries, we performed laparotomy on mice to expose the liver and tumor area and conducted ex vivo PAI of SHCC and adjacent liver tissue. The photograph of the OR-PAM setup was presented in S10 in the Supporting Information, which was applied to perform the label-free photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) imaging of SHCC and hepatic lobules. As shown in Figures 5A and S11 in the Supporting Information, the SHCC (diameter less than 1.2 mm) boundaries and hepatic lobules (diameter about 0.5 mm) could be structurally exhibited with a high resolution by the OR-PAM system which also could be further verified by the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Importantly, OR-PAM images show a high degree of consistency with pathology. Although the OR-PAM system cannot penetrate deep and may require invasive procedures, its high-resolution is of great diagnostic value for unlabeled imaging of superficial tumors such as the skin and mucosa.50–52 After solving the problem of penetration depth, OR-PAM demonstrates great value in the accurate diagnosis of tumors in clinical practice. PACT/FL imaging exhibits great penetration depth and can be applied for targeted imaging in vivo of abdominal organs in mice, which is our next research point.Figure 5(A) Photograph, PAM imaging and H&E staining of SHCC in mouse.

As demonstrated in the previous in vitro experiments, the targeting ability of IPP-c NPs was accurately confirmed. To study the performance of NPs-based PAI in abdominal tumors, the orthotopic SHCC mouse model was applied to perform PAI of SHCC in vivo. Ten days after cell implantation, the SHCC formation in mice was confirmed via bioluminescence monitoring. A photograph of the PAI device is presented in Figure S12 in the Supporting Information, which includes the PA system, a water tank, an anesthetic gas tube, and a lifting platform. The IPP-c NPs/ICG (25 mg·kg−1) were intravenously injected into the nude mice, and the NIR PACT system was applied to monitor the optimal tumor imaging region in the following 24 hours post-injection. As presented in Figure 5B, in the IPP-c group, NPs can target and accumulate in the tumor region up to 5 hours after injection, while there was no significant tumor aggregation in the ICG group. Quantitative analysis of the PA signals in the tumor area presented in Figure 5C suggests that the PA signal in the IPP-c group was significantly stronger than ICG group at 5 h and 12 h post-injection (P<0.001). In addition, compared with the ICG group, the PA signal in tumor area of the IPP-c group was significantly enhanced at 24 h after injection (P<0.01). These in vivo results indicate that the targeted nano-agent IPP-c can be actively ingested by CXCR4-overexpressing HCC tumor cells and accumulated in the tumor area for a long time, while ICG metabolizes rapidly and cannot be uptaken by tumor cells. Hence, IPP-c is recommended to achieve efficient PAI and imaging-guided precision theranostic of SHCC in vivo.
In previous results, the orthotopic SHCC has been imaged by PACT to monitor a cross-section of the tumor. Nevertheless, FLI can image the body distribution after NPs injection, which enables further analysis of the systemic metabolism of IPP-c in vivo. The IPP-c NPs/ICG (25 mg·kg−1) were intravenously injected into the SHCC tumor-bearing mice, and the whole-body FL imaging in 24 hours postinjection were monitored by the in vivo Xtreme live animal imaging system. As presented in Figure 5D, the FL signal reaches the whole body and peaks in the liver tumor 5 hours after IPP-c injection, and remains in the liver tumor area for up to 24 hours. However, 5 hours after ICG injection, the FL signal only appeared in the liver region without obvious tumor area aggregation, and could be completely dissipated within 24 hours. The quantitative analysis of FL signal in tumor area shown in the Figure 5E demonstrates that the signal in the IPP-c group was significantly stronger than the ICG group at 5 h and 24 h after NPs/ICG injection (P<0.01). The ex vivo FLI of the tumors and other major organs were performed at 5 hours postinjection to further confirm the NPs accumulation (Figure 5F), and the signal quantitative analysis are shown in Figure 5G. The PA signal in the IPP-c group was strong in orthotopic tumors, which was significantly stronger than the ICG group (P<0.01), indicating that the IPP-c NPs targeted aggregation in SHCCs of mice. Meanwhile, it provides an important basis for the time of subsequent PTT in vivo. Different from the deficiency in non-targeting and fluorescence quenching of ICG, IPP-c exhibits a superior SHCC-targeting and stable optical imaging ability. In summary, through targeted PAI and FLI of SHCCs, IPP-c can diagnose HCC tumor at an early stage, which encourages further theranostic investigations assisted by IPP-c on early-stage HCC in vivo.
Precision guided by PAI and FLI, the targeted PTT/PDT against SHCC in nude mice was considered to be 5 hours after IPP-c NPs injection. The NIR phototheranostic setup and its photograph is presented in Figure S13 in the Supporting Information. Before treatment, PTT experiments of IPP-c, whole blood, water, and the liver tissue (the normal liver was irradiated by 808-nm laser after laparotomy) were carried out to verify the safety of phototheranostic treatment (Figure S14, Supporting Information). As expected, after irradiated by an 808-nm laser with an energy of 0.8W·cm−2 for 10 minutes, the nano-agent IPP-c rapidly increased the temperature by 25.4°C, while the elevation of whole blood, liver tissue, and PBS were only 3.5°C, 2.9°C and 2.7°C, respectively, indicating reliable biosecurity. The PTT/PDT treatment of the SHCC based on IPP-c NPs is presented in Figure 6A and B, via real-time and accurate guidance by the optical imaging, under the 808-nm laser exposure (energy: 0.8W·cm−2), the temperature of the tumor region in the Laser + IPP-c group rapidly rised up to 50°C within 5 minutes, and then keep the hyperthermia condition for 7 minutes. This hyperthermia was enough to achieve efficient PTT/PDT to treat tumors and did not cause a second injury in healthy tissue. In contrast, the temperature of the tumor region only increased about 40°C in the Laser + PBS group. As we have demonstrated in the in vivo and ex vivo PAI/FLI experiments that the high concentration of IPP-c NPs in the tumor lesion and very low level in the normal liver tissue due to both active and passive targeting ability. Thus, the tumor tissue can be ablated owing to the photothermal effect (over 50°C) from IPP-c NPs, while the normal liver tissue with few IPP-c NPs does not produce significant photothermal effect (under 40°C), which can minimize photothermal damages to healthy tissue.Figure 6(A) Infrared thermal imaging of orthotopic tumor-bearing mice treated respectively with IPP-c and PBS upon 808-nm laser irradiation (0.8W·cm−2) for different durations.

Figure 6C and D present efficacy evaluation of PTT/PDT by bioluminescence imaging of orthotopic tumors. Bioluminescence imaging and quantitative data indicate that the bioluminescence signals in the tumor regions were significantly reduced in the Laser + IPP-c group, but were enhanced in the Laser + PBS group. For the viability of tumor cells directly reflects the state of the SHCC, the inspiring bioluminescence results indicate that the phototherapy of SHCC was effective. H&E staining and tumor diameter measurement of the orthotopic tumors in all groups were shown in Figures 6E and S15 (Supporting Information) on the 15th day posttreatment indicate remarkable tumor necrosis and inhibition in the Laser + IPP-c group after phototherapy, while in the Laser + PBS, PBS and IPP-c groups, the tumors show significantly proliferation with no necrosis posttreatment. These results further confirm the efficacy of targeted PTT/PDT of SHCCs using the IPP-c nano-agent. According to literature reports,53,54 similar studies have shown successful phototheranostic on SHCCs in mice; however, non-targeted and imprecise phototheranostic is not ideal. Targeted, accurate and effective optical imaging-guided phototheranostic offers new methods and approaches of optical imaging and PTT/PDT theranostic strategy of orthotopic SHCC in mice, which shows great potential for clinical translation.55
A comprehensive evaluation of the safety of the phototheranostic is required for further clinical translation. For tissue degeneration or major organ possible damage caused by PTT/PDT treatment, systematic evaluation can be carried out by detecting NPs metabolism, recording body weight and life behavior changes, testing biochemical indexes, and histopathological examination of organs posttreatment. The amount of NPs peaked in the liver tumor at 5-hour postinjection and could be completely dissipated within 24 hours, and the PA signals amplitude in main organs (liver, spleen, heart, lung, and kidney) nearly return to pre-injection levels after 48 hours (Figure S16, Supporting Information), which indicates that IPP-c NPs can be metabolized well in vivo. Body weight and life behavior of all groups were continuously monitored at 2-day intervals for 14 days after treatment (Figure S17 in the Supporting Information). In all groups, we did not observed any significant abnormal behavior or weight loss (eg, abnormal movement, physical aggression or asitia). Meanwhile, the routine and biochemical tests of blood in all groups were measured in nude mice to evaluate the biosafety of NPs and phototherapy. As presented in Figure S18 in the Supporting Information, there is almost no noticeable abnormality of the blood routine and biochemistry in any of the groups, which indicates a superior biosafety of IPP-c NPs in vivo. Besides, H&E staining of the major organs in all groups are shown in Figure 6E on the 15th day after treatment. No obvious tissue degeneration or major organ injury occurred in each group, which proves the security of NIR laser-irradiation and NPs injection during the whole treatment period. The targeted nano-agent IPP-c has demonstrated good stability, biosafety, superior PAI/FLI ability, and reliable PTT/PDT performance, which encourages more opportunities for phototheranostics in vivo in multiple tumor models. In all, the therapeutic results suggest that the nanoplatform and imaging-guided phototheranostic demonstrate great potential for clinical accurate diagnosis and efficient treatment of early-stage HCC.
To conclude, a multifunctional CXCR4-targeted indocyanine green/platinum-doped polydopamine nanoparticle (IPP-c) was synthesized as an SHCC-specific contrast nano-agent for high-resolution precise diagnostic photoacoustic/fluorescence imaging and imaging-guided targeted PTT/PDT of orthotopic SHCC. Targeted nanoparticle IPP-c demonstrates superior targeting ability by selectively killing CXCR4-overexpressing HCC cells. Subsequently, the SHCC (diameter less than 1.2 mm) was accurately diagnosed by the efficient dual-modal photoacoustic/fluorescence imaging in vivo and ex vivo. Via the real-time quantitative guidance by optical imaging, effective and mini-invasive phototherapeutics of orthotopic SHCCs were successfully implemented. This study provides a new perception for building a versatile targeted nanoplatform for phototheranostics of early-stage HCC.

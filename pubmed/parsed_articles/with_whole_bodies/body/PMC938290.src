We are pleased to present the two winning abstracts from the RT and Student category poster presentations that were displayed virtually between May 13 and 14, 2022. As evidenced the by following abstracts, the work of our colleagues in 2022 highlights current research and practice innovations led by respiratory therapists and students.

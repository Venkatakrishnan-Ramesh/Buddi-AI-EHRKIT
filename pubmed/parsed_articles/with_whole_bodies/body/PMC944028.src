Mitochondria are essential for life as they support metabolic functions and ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation. At the same time, they also regulate intrinsic apoptotic cell death via mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, and subsequent caspase activation driven by effector proapoptotic B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members (prominently BAX or BAK) (Bock and Tait, 2020). Mitochondria are structurally dynamic interconnected organelles that continuously undergo mitochondrial fusion and fission events. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by recruitment of the cytosolic GTPase dynamin 1-like protein (DNM1L/Drp1) on outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), through binding with mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) (Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008), Mid51, and Mid49 (Palmer et al., 2011). Mitochondrial fusion involves three major proteins: optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) mediates inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) fusion (Ishihara et al., 2006), while mitofusin (MFN) 1 and 2 are responsible for OMM fusion (Filadi et al., 2018). MFN 1 and 2 belong to the large family of mitochondrial transmembrane GTPases and form homomeric/heteromeric complexes to induce mitochondrial outer membrane fusion. The crucial balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission, referred to as mitochondrial dynamics, is closely associated with mitochondrial function as well as establishment of overall mitochondrial architecture. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction and aberrant balance between fusion/fission have been implicated in a number of cellular physiology and pathology, such as neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, cardiomyopathies (Suárez-Rivero et al., 2016), and cancer (Maycotte et al., 2017).
Although mitochondria contain their own genome, transcription, and translation mechanisms, mitochondrial DNA encodes for only 1% of the total mitochondrial proteome. The rest 99% is encoded by nuclear DNA, translated in ER, and then translocated to the mitochondria (Song et al., 2021). Eventually, the fine tune of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial gene expressions decides overall mitochondrial biogenesis as well as proper assembly of mitochondrial protein complexes (Lionaki et al., 2016), emphasizing the significance of crosstalk between mitochondria and nucleus. This interorganellar coordination relies on the redistribution of nuclear or mitochondrial proteins between the two organelles. Nuclear proteins with mitochondrial distribution are mainly transcription factors (TFs) that translocate to mitochondria upon a stress stimulus or reside in mitochondria under steady-state conditions. Among TFs localized in mitochondria, signal transducer and activators of transcriptions (STATs), well-known nuclear TF targeting to mitochondria, play key roles in mitochondria (Meier and Larner, 2014). Especially, STAT3, a most studied isoform among them, was reported to localize in mitochondrial matrix and IMM through phosphorylation of serine 727, and regulates the activity of electron transport chain complex influencing cellular metabolism (Wegrzyn et al., 2009), protection against various stresses (Szczepanek et al., 2011), and tumorigenesis (Gough et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013). Although other STAT subfamilies, STAT1, 2, 5, and 6, also have been shown to localize to mitochondria (Bourke et al., 2013; Chueh et al., 2010; Goswami et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2013), crucial questions, such as whether STATs possess mitochondrial-targeting sequences (MTS), and how mitochondrial function regulated by individual STAT is linked to human disease, however, remains to be clarified.
We found that mitochondrial fragmentation was triggered in STAT6-GFP-expressing mitochondria, suggesting mitochondrial role of STAT6. This raises a number of important questions regarding STAT6 function and regulation in mitochondria. For example, where is submitochondrial localization of STAT6? What is mitochondrial STAT6 function and derived cellular/physiological events from mitochondrial STAT6?
To address these questions, we dissected the role of STAT6 as a mitochondrial protein. Our findings prove that STAT6 is an OMM protein with MTS and transmembrane segments anchored to OMM. Also, using quantitative proteomic analysis, we found that MFN2 is a crucial binding partner of mitochondrial STAT6 in OMM that mediates inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. Moreover, we demonstrate that mitochondrial accumulation of STAT6 under hypoxic conditions induced Cytochrome c release linked to cell death and tumorigenesis inhibition. Altogether, our findings present insights into the cellular and physiological roles of STAT6 in mitochondria.
Based on the previous finding suggesting the presence of STAT6 within mitochondria (Khan et al., 2013), we first examined it by transiently transfecting STAT6-GFP to U373-MG cell lines (STAT6-GFP). Confocal images demonstrated that STAT6-GFP signals were co-localized with TOM20 (mitochondria marker) at mitochondria (Figure 1A). Biochemical fractionation experiments with homogenates of brain tissues also demonstrated mitochondrial distribution of STAT6 (Figure 1B). Results using cultured primary astrocytes obtained from brain and STAT6-expressing U373-MG (STAT6-U373) showed consistent results, revealing mitochondrial presence of STAT6 (Figure 1C). That was also observed in other cell lines, including several glioma cell lines (Figure S1A), revealing that mitochondrial localization of STAT6 is a ubiquitous phenomenon. Further fractionation assays to determine subcellular localization of STAT6 demonstrated that it was detected in outer membrane of mitochondria (OMM) fraction (Figure 1D). EM images demonstrated immunogold-labeled STAT6 localized along the mitochondrial surface, where TOM20 signals were detected (Figure S1B). Next, to determine whether STAT6 is an integral membrane protein in OMM, mitochondria were isolated from astrocytes and STAT6-U373, and were subjected to high salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) extraction (Figures 1E and 1F). Sodium carbonate extraction is widely accepted as the method to distinguish peripheral from integral membrane protein (Fujiki et al., 1982) and high salt extraction is an alternative method for isolating membranes to identify integral membrane proteins (Okamoto et al., 2001). Specific markers for mitochondrial fractions were served: The signal-anchored outer membrane protein TOM20 with moderate hydrophobicity (Ahting et al., 2005), intermembrane space or loosely associated inner membrane protein CYCS (Cytochrome c), inner membrane protein TIM23, and matrix-located ACO2 (Aconitase 2), respectively. STAT6 was detected in pellet (P) fractions of mitochondria with high salt in both cell types (Figure 1E), unraveling that it is an integral membrane protein similar to TOM20 and TIM23. Although STAT6 was resistant to carbonate treatment at pH range of 9.5–11.5, carbonate extraction at pH 12.5 did result in the release of STAT6 into the supernatant fraction (Figure 1F). This suggests that STAT6 is either partially embedded into the outer membrane or has a moderately hydrophobic transmembrane domain because mitochondrial proteins with moderate hydrophobicity have been shown to be released from the membrane upon sodium carbonate treatment (Kim et al., 2015). These findings were also observed in other cell lines tested (Figures S1C–S1F). To further confirm that STAT6 is an integral protein in OMM, we treated proteinase K (PK) on isolated mitochondria from astrocytes and STAT6-U373, and then performed Western blot using STAT6 antibodies targeted to different sites. While STAT6 was disappeared in PK-treated mitochondria using the STAT6 antibodies against N-terminal, 280–480 residues, and c-terminal (Figure S1G), the truncated STAT6 bands were detected when SH2 domain-targeted STAT6 antibody was applied (Figure 1G), suggesting that SH2 domain of STAT6 is possibly a transmembrane segment of OMM or exposed to mitochondrial intermembrane space. These results were also confirmed in thrombin (T.)-treated mitochondria from astrocytes and STAT6-U373 (Figure S1H), and observed in PK-treated mitochondria from other cell lines (Figure S1I). Furthermore, using membrane protein explorer (MPEx) program, we demonstrated that STAT6 possesses predicted hydrophobic transmembrane segments (293–311, 399–417, 506–524, 537–555, and 688–706 residues) (Figure 1H). In addition, translocon-mediated TM (transmembrane) analysis suggests that 532–552 residues in STAT6 might be transmembrane segments (Figure S1J). Taken together, these data suggest that STAT6 localizes in OMM, not within mitochondria.Figure 1STAT6 is localized in mitochondrial outer membrane (OMM)(A) Confocal images of mitochondrial morphology in U373-MG transfected with GFP or STAT6-GFP, stained with TOM20 (red, mitochondrial marker).

The mitochondrial proteins usually have mitochondrial-targeting sequences (MTS). However, since previous published finding using MitoProt2 algorithm proposed lack of MTS within STAT6 (Khan et al., 2013), we performed experiments to determine it. To identify whether STAT6 has MTSs, we generated domain-deleted STAT6 mutants-expressing stable cell lines and assessed the mitochondrial localization of STAT6 mutants in these stable cell lines using sucrose gradient fractionation and Western blot (Figures 2A and 2B). Interestingly, we found that the 1–260 residues-deleted STAT6 (Δ 1–260) was absent in mitochondrial fraction implying that the MTS of STAT6 exists in 1–260 residues of the TF.Figure 2Identification of mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) in STAT6(A) Schematic of STAT6-WT and domain-deleted mutants with myc-tag.

In line with previous reports that MTS of the most mitochondrial proteins exist at N termini, STAT6 mutant without N-terminal 1–50 residues (Δ1–50) did not appear in mitochondrial fraction, indicating that the MTS of STAT6 is in N-terminal region of STAT6 (Figure 2C).
To identify the correct MTS of STAT6, we transfected the different human STAT6 N-terminal fragments with GFP-tag on human U373-MG and mouse B16-F10 (Figures 2D–2G, and S2A). Among them, the human 1–30 residues of STAT6 showed definitive mitochondrial localization in human U373-MG (Figures 2D, F, and S2B), also even in mouse B16–F10 (Figures 2E and 2G). These results also were observed in HEK 293 cells (Figure S2C). Figure 2H shows that residues 1–30 of STAT6 are highly conserved in six species of mammals indicating that MTS of STAT6 is conserved in some species of mammals. Then, how does STAT6 with MTSs get localized in the OMM? Among domain-deleted STAT6 mutants, 624–847 residues-deleted STAT6 (ΔTAD) was found in mitochondrial fraction (Figure 2B), and protected against externally added PK on mitochondria. (Figure 2J). Also, ΔTAD was found in the supernatant fraction upon high salt extraction of mitochondria (Figure 2K), indicating that ΔTAD is localized within mitochondria, not in OMM. We hypothesized that STAT6 localization in OMM needs partial sequences within TAD and the partial sequences might be transmembrane segments. To identify the partial sequences, we generated TAD-partially deleted STAT6 mutants (Δ674–847, Δ699–847, and Δ774–847)-expressing stable cell lines and assessed the mitochondrial localization of these mutants to identify transmembrane segments within TAD of STAT6 (Figures 2L–2N). Interestingly, Δ674–847 was protected against externally added PK on mitochondria (Figure 2L) and still found in supernatant fraction upon high salt extraction of mitochondria (Figure 2M) whereas 699–847 and Δ774–847 were found in the pellet fraction upon high salt extraction of mitochondria (Figure 2N), indicating that 674–698 residues of STAT6 might be transmembrane segments. Taken together, STAT6 is an OMM protein that possesses MTS and transmembrane segments.
To examine the function of mitochondrial STAT6, we first explored binding partner with mitochondrial STAT6, using proteomic analysis. MS spectrometry analysis following affinity purification identified 89 proteins that putatively bound to STAT6 in mouse brain tissue. GO data demonstrated that 18 candidates were related to mitochondria (Figure 3A and Table S1), where 4 were located in OMM (Figure 3B). And, three among the 4 OMM proteins were involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission (Figure 3B). Among these candidates, MFN2 and MFF, key regulators related to mitochondrial fusion–fission mechanisms in OMM, were identified as STAT6-binding candidates using immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis, revealing that that MFN2 binding with STAT6 was prominent but that with MFF was not evident in 293T and HeLa cells (Figure 3C). To map the domain interaction between MFN2 and STAT6, we constructed individual domain-deleted mutants of STAT6 and MFN2 (Figures 3D and 3F). By IP analysis, we demonstrated that 31–260 residues, DNA-binding (DBD), and linker domain of STAT6 bound to heptad region (HR2) domain of MFN2 (Figures 3E and 3G). Interestingly, IP analysis revealed that ΔTAD failed to interact with MFN2, whereas partially restored ΔTAD (Δ699–847 and Δ774–847) bound to MFN2 (Figure 3E). These results were consistent with mitochondrial re-localization of Δ699–847- and Δ774–847- STAT6 in OMM (Figure 2O).Figure 3MFN2 interacts with STAT6 in OMM(A and B) Quantitative label-free mass spectrometry identification of STAT6-binding candidates using STAT6 IP product obtained from mouse brain.(A) Subcellular localization of 89 STAT6-interacting candidates.

Since STAT6 binds to MFN2 through HR2 region that is essential for MFN2 dimerization/mitochondrial tethering that precedes OMM fusion (Filadi et al., 2018) and mitochondrial fragmentation/abnormal morphology was detected in STAT6-expressing cells (Figures S3A–S3C, and Figure 1A), we hypothesized that STAT6 in OMM inhibits mitochondrial elongation and fusion by blocking MFN2 dimerization. To confirm this hypothesis, we generated FLAG-tagged and myc-tagged MFN2-coexpressing stable cell line, and applied in situ Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA), which allows us to examine MFN2 dimerization by determining the proximity between FLAG-tagged MFN2 and myc-tagged MFN2. We observed a more than 2-fold increase in the PLA-positive signals of STAT6 siRNA-transfected cells (Figures 4A and 4B). Conversely, we observed the decrease in the PLA signal of STAT6 WT-GFP and SH2 domain-deleted STAT6 (ΔSH2, function of transcription factor is extinct)-GFP-expressing cells compared with Mock-GFP-expressing cells, but restored PLA signal of MTS-deleted STAT6 (ΔMTS, targeting to mitochondria is disabled)-GFP-expressing cells. (Figure 4C) Collectively, STAT6 attenuates MFN2 dimerization.Figure 4STAT6 inhibits MFN2 dimerizationTo analyze MFN2 dimerization, MFN2-myc/MFN2-FLAG-coexpressing stable cell line was generated.(A) Western blot analysis using MFN2-myc/MFN2-FLAG-coexpressing stable cell line transfected with Control siRNA or STAT6 siRNA.(B) In situ Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA) in MFN2-myc/MFN2-FLAG-coexpressing stable cell lines transfected with Control siRNA or STAT6 siRNA.

Next, to determine whether mitochondrial morphology and fusion were blocked by STAT6 in OMM, we generated STAT6 KO stable cell lines from 293T and B16-F10 melanoma using CRISPR Cas9 system, and observed mitochondrial elongation in the STAT6 KO stable cell lines. (Figures S3D–S3G). To dissect whether STAT6 in OMM induces mitochondrial fragmentation, we analyzed mitochondrial morphology in STAT6 WT or several STAT6 mutants-expressing cells (Figures 5A–5D). Immunostaining analysis revealed that STAT6 WT and ΔSH2 triggered mitochondrial fragmentation, whereas ΔMTS failed to induce mitochondrial fragmentation. To further test mitochondrial fusion regulated by STAT6 in OMM, we evaluated the effects of mitochondrial STAT6 on extent of mitochondrial fusion using a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced cell fusion assay (Figures 5E–5H). STAT6 WT-myc, ΔSH2-myc, and ΔMTS-myc-expressing stable cell lines were generated from STAT6 KO-293T stable cell lines (Figure 5F). These stable cell lines were transfected with mitochondria-targeting green or red fluorescent (mitoGFP or mitoRFP) and were mixed. Cycloheximide was pretreated 30 min prior to cell fusion to inhibit synthesis of the fluorescent protein. The cells were incubated for 3 h post cell fusion, hybrid polykaryons were observed by confocal microscopy, and mitochondrial fusion was determined by mixing of green and red fluorescence signals (yellow) in the polykaryons (Figure 5G). The extent of mitochondrial fusion (colocalization between green and red fluorescence signals) in each polykaryon was further analyzed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient (Figure 5H). A significantly high level of mitochondrial fusion was observed in STAT6 KO-hybrid cells, compared to parental-hybrid cells. In contrast, restoration of STAT6 WT and ΔSH2 expression from STAT6 KO cells resulted in reduced mitochondrial fusion, whereas restoration of ΔMTS expression failed to reduce mitochondrial fusion, implying that STAT6 in OMM attenuates mitochondrial fusion.Figure 5STAT6 in OMM impairs mitochondrial fusion(A) Schematic of STAT6 WT and deletion mutants with mCherry.(B–D) Confocal images (C) of mitochondrial morphology in STAT6 WT or deletion mutants-expressing 293T cells stained with TOM20.

Mitochondrial fragmentation is associated with mitochondrial depolarization and reduced ATP production (Jheng et al., 2012). Various stress, such as hypoxia, induce mitochondrial fragmentation, accompanied by mitochondrial accumulation of DRP1 and BAX (Brooks et al., 2011; Din et al., 2013), that subsequently trigger mitochondrial Cytochrome c release linked to apoptosis (Zhang et al., 2018). To ascertain whether mitochondrial fragmentation by STAT6 in OMM affects ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential, we measured ATP, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) level, and membrane potential of STAT6 WT, ΔSH2, and ΔMTS-expressing cells relative to Mock-expressing cells. STAT6 WT and ΔSH2 both resulted in a decrease of ATP, OCR level, and mitochondrial membrane potential, whereas ΔMTS recovered ATP, OCR level, and mitochondrial membrane potential (Figures S4A–S4C). Especially during hypoxia, STAT6 accumulation in mitochondria (Figure 6A) and its interaction with MFN2 (Figure 6B) were increased. Moreover, mitochondrial fragmentation and Cytochrome c release into cytoplasm (Figures 6C and 6D) were increased in STAT6-expressing cells compared to Mock-expressing cells. However, cytoplasmic Cytochrome c levels in ΔMTS-expressing cells exposed to hypoxia were alleviated to similar levels found in Mock-expressing cells (Figure 6D). Figure 6E reveals that expression of STAT6 WT and ΔSH2 increased apoptotic cell death compared to Mock-expressing cells, which was decreased in ΔMTS-expressing cells. Also, Figures S4D–S4G indicate the apoptotic cell death induced by hypoxia in parental 293T cells was decreased in STAT6 KO-293T cells (Figure S4D) and mitochondrial fragmentation/apoptotic cell death induced by STAT6 WT was alleviated in MFN2 WT-overexpressing cells (Figures S4E–S4F).Figure 6Mitochondrial STAT6 accumulation under hypoxic condition induces cell death(A and B) 293T cells were exposed to hypoxia (0.1%) for the indicated times.

Interestingly, we observed significantly more rapid growth in STAT6 KO-293T cells compared to parental cells. So, we investigated whether STAT6 in OMM attenuates regulation of cell growth. The frequency of STAT6 KO-293T colony formation increased dramatically under regular medium culture (Figure 6F). Conversely, recovery of STAT6 WT or ΔSH2 expression from STAT6 KO-293T inhibited cell growth whereas recovery of ΔMTS expression induced cell growth again (Figure 6G). We have confirmed in Figures 6C–6E that STAT6 in OMM triggered mitochondrial fragmentation, Cytochrome c release, and cell death with hypoxic condition, which is a common feature of solid tumor microenvironment (Guha and Avadhani, 2013).
To investigate whether STAT6 in OMM regulates tumorigenesis, the tumorigenic potential was tested in vitro by soft-agar assay. STAT6 KO-293T cells grew faster than parental cells in an anchorage-independent way in soft agar (Figure 6H). However, STAT6 WT and ΔSH2 expression reduced colony formation whereas ΔMTS recovered colony formation again (Figure 6I). We next examined the impact of STAT6 on tumor growth in vivo (Figure 7). STAT6-deficient 293T exhibited stronger cancer progression than parental cells, as evaluated by larger tumor volume over the treatment period (Figures 7A–7C). Interestingly, STAT6 WT or ΔSH2-expressing 293T exhibited inhibition of cancer progression whereas ΔMTS-expressing 293T recovered cancer progression (Figures 7D–7H).Figure 7Mitochondrial STAT6 accumulation leads to tumorigenesis inhibitionIn vivo results on xenograft mouse models.(A–C) Parental or STAT6 KO-293T stable cell line (2 × 106 cells) was injected subcutaneously into the left or right flank of nude mice (n = 18).(A) Representative images of xenograft tumor.(B) Tumor growth curve was measured over time.

Aberrant mitochondrial dynamics causes a vast array of health concerns including metabolic stroke, aging, myopathy, developmental or cognitive disabilities, cancer, and much more. For this reason, understanding the mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics is of importance especially in providing therapeutic strategies. Despite recent progress in research on the mitochondrial function of STAT subfamily (Meier and Larner, 2014), their submitochondrial localization and underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.
Our study investigated the role and underlying mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics regulated by STAT6 as an OMM protein in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial-related diseases.
We also investigated if other STAT family members (STAT1, 2, 3, and 5) localize in OMM of brain tissue, and screened for their subcellular distribution in brain tissue. Figure S5A demonstrates that STAT1, 3, and 5 were detected in mitochondrial fraction, implying mitochondrial localization of these STATs. PK treatment of mitochondria from astrocytes showed that STAT1 likely localizes in OMM (Figure S5B). Furthermore, MPEx program suggests that STAT1 possesses predicted hydrophobic transmembrane segments (300–318, 461–504, and 552–582 residues) (Figure S5C). These results imply mitochondrial role of STAT1 in OMM, as well as STAT6.
Our findings indicate that STAT6 in OMM interacts with MFN2, thereby suppressing mitochondrial fusion (Figure 5). These findings imply that STAT6 is involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission mechanism.
MFN2 is responsible for fusion of OMM, and is composed of N-terminal GTPase domain, heptad-repeat (HR) 1, proline-rich, and C-terminal HR2 exposed to cytosolic face through two transmembrane domains (TM) crossing the OMM (Filadi et al., 2018). To induce OMM fusion, first of all, it is required of membrane tethering that is mediated by the interaction between HR2 of MFN2 on opposite OMM (Koshiba et al., 2004). Next, OMM fusion is triggered by interaction of N-terminal GTPase domains (Hales and Fuller, 1997). Strikingly, we found that STAT6 was bound to HR2 of MFN2 (Figure 3), indicating that STAT6 blocked OMM tethering mediated by HR2 of MFN2, and inhibited mitochondrial fusion as a result (Figure 5). These findings raise an interesting question: What is required to target STAT6 to OMM? Although it was previously reported that STAT6 is localized within mitochondria using immunogold-EM imaging and lacked obvious mitochondrial-targeting sequences (MTS) (Khan et al., 2013), we do not share this opinion. On the basis of our results, we furnish strong arguments against the previous report. First, is STAT6 devoid of MTS? Our data revealed that 1–30 residues at the N-terminal of STAT6 serve as MTS (Figures 2D–2G, and S2) in agreement with a number of reports that ∼90% of mitochondrial proteins have MTS at N-terminal of the proteins (Kang et al., 2018), supporting that STAT6 is as a mitochondrial protein with MTS. Second, as shown in Figures S1B and S1G–S1I, and Figure 1G, we guessed that STAT6 may be localized in OMM through several experiments including immunogold-EM imaging. If STAT6 is imported within mitochondria, the STAT6 might be protected from thrombin or PK. Our data, however, revealed that the large N-terminal (1–480 residues) and the short C-terminal portion of STAT6 in OMM are exposed to cytosolic face whereas SH2 domain of STAT6 may be under OMM. This finding is in line with our result that STAT6 was bound to MFN2 through the large N-terminal region exposed to cytosolic face (Figure 3E). Finally, although the previous report demonstrated that STAT6 N-terminal fragments (1–459 residues) were localized within mitochondria, the result is due to the lack of transmembrane segments (624–698 residues of STAT6) to be anchored in OMM. Thus, we assert STAT6 in OMM interacts with MFN2 and inhibits mitochondrial fusion.
Our MS data (Figure 3B) revealed that MFF and ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1) play important roles in mitochondrial fission (Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008; Niemann et al., 2005), and also serve as STAT6-binding candidates in OMM. MFF, is a C-tail-anchored protein in OMM, recruits dynamin-related protein 1(Drp1) to the mitochondrial surface (Otera et al., 2010). Recruited DRP1, due to its ability to homo-oligomerize, forms spiral structure around the mitochondrial tubules, and induces mitochondrial fission (Bui and Shaw, 2013). GDAP1, is a single-pass transmembrane protein anchored by its C-tail to OMM (Wagner et al., 2009), also contributes to mitochondrial fragmentation. Therefore, does STAT6 causes excessive mitochondrial fission through interaction with MFF or GDAP1 in OMM? Although our IP data also demonstrated that MFF interacted with STAT6, any STAT6 mutants failed to block or trigger DRP-1 recruitment (data not shown). Underlying mechanisms for how STAT6-MFF interaction affects mitochondrial fission, and whether STAT6 binds to GDAP1 in OMM should be investigated.
Mitochondria are not only the power houses for energy production, they also regulate many aspects of cellular processes (McBride et al., 2006). Mitochondria are regulated by stringent nuclear control (anterograde regulation) that can promote mitochondrial biogenesis. Conversely, mitochondria also generate and transduce signals to the nucleus (retrograde response) to modify cellular function (Xia et al., 2019). These anterograde and retrograde signals are referred to as mitonuclear communication (Quirós et al., 2016), and contribute to maintaining cellular homeostasis under various stress responses including hypoxia (Guha and Avadhani, 2013). Hypoxia, as one of the fundamentally important features of solid tumors (Ruan et al., 2009), triggers mitochondrial ROS production, membrane potential (Δψm) loss, and dysfunction (Chandel et al., 1997; Hamanaka and Chandel, 2009; Solaini et al., 2010; Weinberg et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2006). We observed that hypoxia induced STAT6 accumulation in mitochondria and triggered STAT6-MFN2 interaction (Figures 6A and 6B). Consequently, mitochondrial STAT6 accumulation in hypoxic conditions aggravated mitochondrial fragmentation, cytochrome c release, cell death in vitro (Figures 6C–6E), and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo (Figure 7), supporting retrograde signaling (Figure S6) and physiological roles derived from mitochondrial STAT6 under hypoxia.
These findings collectively show that mitonuclear communication regulated by STAT6 exerts influence on diverse cellular and physiological events. However, physiological roles/functions of STAT6 OMM protein in different cells and tissues exposed to various conditions other than hypoxia, such as disease models, need to be investigated.
Because abnormal mitochondrial quality control alters mitochondrial metabolism and causes a number of symptoms, we recommend for further additional studies to investigate potential roles of yet to be characterized TFs in influencing mitochondrial quality control systems. This is an important step toward understanding the underlying pathophysiology of mitochondrial diseases.
We propose a role for STAT6 in regulation of mitochondrial fusion/fission via inhibition of MFN2 dimerization. Although we show that STAT6 in OMM inhibits mitochondrial fusion through direct interaction with MFN2, we cannot fully exclude the possibilities that STAT6 induces mitochondrial fission through other STAT6-interacting proteins (such as MFF and GDAP1) identified from our proteomic analysis.
Mitochondrial proteins, similar to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, can also undergo diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs), leading to altered mitochondrial function (Stram and Payne, 2016). In this context, it is required to identify the PTMs of mitochondrial STAT6 and establish the underlying mechanism of the STAT6 PTMs in mitochondrial function.
Although our study findings reveal that mitochondrial STAT6 is involved in tumorigenesis inhibition, its physiological roles in various disease models remain to be determined.

Primary mouse astrocytes were cultured from the cerebral cortices of 1-day-old C57BL/6J mice (KOATECH, Korea). Cell suspensions were prepared by mechanical digestion of the cortices in DMEM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10% FBS (GenDepot, Barker, TX, USA) and 0.1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Gibco/Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were dispensed to 75-cm2 T-flasks and cultured for 2 weeks. For astrocyte cultures, the flasks were shaken at 250 rpm for 18 h at 37 °C to separate the microglia and oligodendrocytes from astrocytes. The cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS. U373-malignant glioma (U373-MG), B16-F10, and 293T were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS.
The human wild type (WT) STAT6, 1–260 residues-deleted (Δ 1–260), DNA binding domain-deleted (ΔDBD), linker domain-deleted (ΔLD), SH2 domain-deleted (ΔSH2), and transactivation domain-deleted STAT6 (ΔTAD) were a kind gift from Soo Jung Park (Ajou University, Korea). The 1–50 residues-deleted (Δ1–50), 31–260 residues-deleted (Δ31–260), 674–847 residues-deleted (Δ674–847), 699–847 residues-deleted (Δ699–847), and 774–847 residues-deleted (Δ774–847) STAT6 were generated from WT STAT6 plasmid.

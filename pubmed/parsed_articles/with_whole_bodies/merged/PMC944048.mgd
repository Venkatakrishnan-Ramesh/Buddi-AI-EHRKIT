Syntheses using classic coupling reactions can be tedious, leading to a dearth of ambipolar semiconducting polymers. Here, we detail the rapid synthesis of balanced ambipolar polymers by using a carbon-hydrogen (C–H) activation strategy. Using this protocol, two C–H reactive hydrogenated monomers and six ambipolar polymers can be rapidly synthesized within 2 h via C–H activation and the optoelectronic properties of the resultant polymers can be characterized. We also describe the fabrication process and performance evaluation of the ambipolar polymers-based organic transistors.
Ambipolar semiconductor polymers that transport electrons and holes simultaneously are of great significance for the manufacture of cost-effective complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-like circuits (Sirringhaus, 2014). Recently, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based ambipolar semiconducting polymers have attracted much attention due to DPP’s decent electron-withdrawing property, coplanar structure, and strong intermolecular interaction (Liu et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2017). However, several issues arise to restrain their practical use as ambipolar transporting materials. First of all, it is difficult to achieve well-balanced hole and electron mobility simultaneously. Upon copolymerization with donor units, such as oligothiophene, and thienothiophene, the resultant DPP-polymers usually display unbalanced ambipolar charge transport with predominant p-type properties (Li et al., 2011; Cinar and Ozturk, 2015). Secondly, the most unfavorable issue with the DPP-based polymers is related to their preparation by mostly Palladium-catalyzed Stille polymerization, which requires arduous purification of organo-stannanes as one of the comonomers (Carsten et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2018). Alternatively, C-H activation polymerization, the so-called direct arylation polymerization (DArP), which can construct conjugated polymers by using the direct activation of C-H bonds, appears as an environmentally benign and atom-economical protocol for semiconducting polymers (Facchetti et al., 2012; Segawa et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2021). However, the successful example of DArP for high performance DPP-based ambipolar semiconducting polymers is only limited to the case that (E)-1,2-Bis(3,4-difluorothiophen-2-yl) ethene (4FTVT) is used as the hydrogenated comonomer unit (Gao et al., 2015). Furthermore, it requires 6 steps to prepare 4FTVT with very low total yield of 21%. With the above issues in present DPP-based polymers, it remains imperative and indispensable to rationally design polymer backbones for high and balanced ambipolar charge transport, as well as efficient synthesis and better solution processability for printed organic electronics. Herein, we provide a detailed protocol for the rapid synthesis of high-performance balanced ambipolar DPP-based polymers by an all C-H activation strategy. The protocol only needs 2% of the reaction time that the traditional method costs and getting 4 times higher total yield compared to traditional method. This time-saving strategy brings a new platform for the efficient production of high-performance ambipolar semiconducting polymers and accordingly, opens the way to a wide range of applications in plastic electronics. Before one begins, the following preparations need to be carried out.Note: All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification.

This protocol allows for the rapid synthesis of high-performance well-balanced ambipolar polymers via an all-C-H activation strategy. First, we rapidly synthesized 2 hydrogenated acceptor-dimer type monomers via C-H activation reactions within 1 h. Second, we rapidly synthesized 6 ambipolar polymers by copolymerizing the above 2 monomers with other 3 dibromo-comonomers within 1 h. After that, we characterized the properties and fabricated the organic transistors based on these ambipolar polymers. Compared with the reported C-H activation method (Ni et al., 2019), this protocol possesses large difference and advancement. From the point view of the chemical structures, the acceptor-acceptor backbone strategy, heteroatom substitution and fluorine substitution were both employed (Scheme 1). Thanks to the synergistic effect of the above molecular design strategies, it resulted in the high and ideally balanced hole and electron mobilities up to 3.56 and 3.75 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which is among the best performance of balanced ambipolar polymers. Most importantly, our protocol only took 1 h to prepare monomers and another 1 h to afford high-mobility ambipolar polymers. Therefore, one of the highlights of our work is the large reduction of the reaction time. The all-C–H-activation strategy presented here only needs 2% of the reaction time that the traditional method takes, and the total yield is 4 times higher than that of the traditional method.
There are several limitations to this protocol. First, the molecular weights of PDTD-BSe and PDFD-BSe polymers are relatively low, due to the coordination of Se atom to the center of palladium catalyst, which may inhibit the polymerization (Meena et al., 2020). Second, during the fabrication of transistors, all the operation should be done in the N2 atmosphere, due to the poor air stability of polymers.
The moderate yields of DTD are due to the formation of oligomers. Because of the highly reactive nature of DTD, we believe that DTD can continue to react with dibromothiophene, leading to other byproducts. Therefore, the reaction time should be controlled within 1 h.
The polymerization is sensitive to the ratio of toluene and DMAc in the mixed solvent. A slight change of the ratio may lead to a largely different polymerization rate.
The volume of the solvent should be measured carefully and appropriately to reduce the operative error. For example, if the monomers (0.2 mmol each) with mixed solvent (2 mL, toluene:DMAc= 1:1) are used for polymerization, it will be easier for the experiment operator to measure the volume of the solvent.

Over 80 species of hypocrealean fungi are reported as pathogens of spiders and harvestmen. Among these fungi, the genus Gibellula is highly regarded as a specialised spider-killer that has never been reported to infect other arthropods. While more than 20 species of Gibellula are known, few attempts to identify the infected spiders have been made despite the fact that the host specificity can help identify the fungal species. Here, we morphologically describe and illustrate eight new species of Gibellula and three new records from Thailand of known species along with the multi-gene phylogeny that clearly showed the segregation among the proposed species. Examination of the Gibellula-infected spider hosts identified Oxyopidae, Uloboridae and, for the first time, the ant-mimicking genus Myrmarachne.Gibellula brevistipitata Kuephadungphan, Tasanathai & Luangsa-ard, G. longicaudata Tasanathai, Kuephadungphan & Luangsa-ard, G. longispora Kuephadungphan & Luangsa-ard, G. nigelii Kuephadungphan, Tasanathai & Luangsa-ard, G. parvula Kuephadungphan, Tasanathai & Luangsa-ard, G. pilosa Kuephadungphan, Tasanathai & Luangsa-ard, G. solita Kuephadungphan, Tasanathai & Luangsa-ard, G. trimorpha Tasanathai, Khonsanit, Kuephadungphan & Luangsa-ard.Citation: Kuephadungphan W, Petcharad B, Tasanathai K, Thanakitpipattana D, Kobmoo N, Khonsanit A, Samson RA, Luangsa-ard JJ (2022). Multi-locus phylogeny unmasks hidden species within the specialised spider-parasitic fungus, Gibellula (Hypocreales, Cordycipitaceae) in Thailand. Studies in Mycology
Spiders are cosmopolitan carnivorous arthropods that play a pivotal role in maintaining the balance of ecological systems (Lee & Kim 2001) by killing 400–800 million tons of insects every year (Nyffeler & Birkhofer 2017). Nevertheless, they are predated by other animals including spiders themselves (Foelix 2011). Fungi are important, but neglected natural enemies of spiders (Evans 2013) as pathogenic fungi can be confused with saprophytic fungi on spider cadavers. Pathogenic fungi can establish dense hyphal networks that hinder species identification of the spider host. Nonetheless, Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae spiders frequently appear to be parasitised by hypocrealean fungi (Ascomycota), in which over 80 species from 13 genera are reported (Shrestha et al. 2019).
Among the hypocrealean fungi, Gibellula is well-known as a pathogenic genus of spiders, but has never been found infecting any other arthropod. This genus has a very long taxonomic history. The synonymising of G. pulchra (the type species) with G. leiopus, limited access to certain holotypes, a lack of holotype sequences as well as living cultures, have created nomenclatural and taxonomic complications which unavoidably created confusion and difficulty in species identification. According to Shrestha et al. (2019) and our previous reports on the five new species of Gibellula (Kuephadungphan et al. 2019, 2020), there are currently 21 species accepted in this genus. Gibellula can be identified by producing aspergillus-like conidiophores on synnemata with the appearance of lupines growing on the spider host. For the species that produce penicillium-like conidiophores such as G. leiopus, G. clavulifera and G. scorpioides, they can be distinguished from others by forming tufted synnemata fully covered with very short conidiophores. Some species possess unique distinguishing morphology, including G. mainsii forming mononematous conidiophores (Samson & Evans 1992), G. brunnea producing synnemata that widen into globose to pyriform fertile areas with pale brown, long, slender sterile tips (Samson & Evans 1992) and G. alata having wing-like synnemata (Petch 1932). However, other species are indistinguishable based solely on the macroscopic features. For instance, G. cebrennini can be discriminated from G. fusiformispora only by having much longer conidiophores (Kuephadungphan et al. 2020). As Gibellula is known to be linked with a Torrubiella sexual morph, it may occur on a spider host either with or without the presence of Gibellula. Gibellula cebrennini is an example of a species that can be found producing only Torrubiella perithecia on spider hosts (Kuephadungphan et al. 2020). Torrubiella was proven by phylogenetic analyses to be a polyphyletic group distributed across several genera, not only within the Cordycipitaceae but also the Clavicipitaceae (Sung et al. 2007, Johnson et al. 2009, Kepler et al. 2017). Considering only the hypocrealean fungi that infect spiders, Akanthomyces and Hevansia are also known to be connected with a Torrubiella sexual morph besides Gibellula (Kepler et al. 2017, Mongkolsamrit et al. 2018). To identify such fungi bearing only sexual morphs to the genus or species ranks, molecular phylogenetic analysis is highly recommended.
Thus far, 12 spider families consisting of Agelenidae, Anyphaenidae, Araneidae, Corinnidae, Deinopidae, Linyphiidae, Pholcidae, Salticidae, Sparassidae, Theridiidae, Thomisidae and Zodariidae have been reported as hosts of Gibellula (Bishop 1990, Hughes et al. 2016, Savić et al. 2016, Kuephadungphan et al. 2020). Our previous report suggested host-specificity in certain species of Gibellula (Kuephadungphan et al. 2020). Therein, G. cebrennini was found only on Cebrenninus cf. magnus whereas G. pigmentosinum and G. scorpioides appeared to be highly specific to Storenomorpha sp. (Zodariidae) and Portia sp. (Salticidae), respectively.
In the exploration of the diversity of the spider-parasitic fungi in Thailand, fungi tentatively identified as Gibellula spp. deposited in the BIOTEC Bangkok Herbarium (BBH) and the BIOTEC Culture Collection (BCC), Thailand, were selected and taxonomically studied using an integrative approach, which revealed the existence of eight new and three known taxa within the genus. The new species described herein are illustrated morphologically and phylogenetically along with the identification of their spider hosts to better understand the spider-fungus relationship.
Spiders parasitised by Gibellula spp. were collected from various locations throughout Thailand. The living leaves with spider cadavers attached on the underside were picked carefully, kept individually in plastic boxes and transported to the laboratory for isolation. The isolation was performed immediately after returning specimens to the laboratory. An agar plug of potato dextrose agar (PDA; fresh diced potato 200 g, dextrose 20 g, agar 15 g, in 1 L distilled water) was cut into small pieces (approximately 0.1 mm3) using a sterile fine needle and was gently swiped over the spores located on the conidiophores along the synnemata and then placed on a PDA plate. Plates were incubated at 25 °C, roughly 12:12 light-dark cycle, and examined daily for conidial germination and also for fungal contaminants. Pure cultures were isolated onto fresh PDA plates by hyphal tip isolation. These were then allowed to grow for 6–8 wk before preparation for storage. Daily observation of conidial germination as well as fungal contamination is important. The fresh fungal specimens are stored at 4 °C until the cultures could be obtained. Notably, the longer the specimen is kept, the lesser is the chance a culture can be made. After the pure cultures of each fungus could be established onto PDA, the fungal specimens were dried at 55 °C for 24 h. All living cultures and dried specimens were then deposited in the BCC and BBH, respectively.
Morphological characterisation of invertebrate-pathogenic fungi depends primarily on the presence of structures associated with asexual and sexual reproductive morphs on the host and the observation should be conducted at various levels from the naked eye via a dissecting microscope and compound microscope. Macroscopic features of asexual morph involve noting the number, colour, shape and length of synnemata as well as the colour of mycelia covering the host while microscopic characters involve the shape and size of vesicles, metulae, phialides, conidial heads, conidia and conidiophores including the arrangement of conidiophores on the surface of synnemata. For the sexual morph the shapes and sizes of perithecia, asci and ascopores are noted. The fungus materials, such as phialides and conidia from the asexual morph and perithecia, asci and ascospores of the sexual morph were mounted in lactophenol cotton blue solution and measured using a compound microscope (Olympus SZ31, Olympus Corporation, Japan). Up to 10 perithecia, and 20–40 asci, part-spores, phialides and conidia were measured, and the amount of variability was calculated using standard deviation (with absolute minima and maxima in brackets) and average +/– standard deviation values. These were photographed by using an Olympus BX51 (Olympus Corporation, Japan). PDA cultures were studied for important morphological characters such as conidia and phialides.
To identify the spider hosts, the World Spider Catalog (2021) (https://wsc.nmbe.ch/) as well as an expert on spider taxonomy were employed. As a spider host is covered with fungi allowing only certain parts, such as the legs and cephalic region to be seen, variation in characteristics of legs and accessories such as setae, spines, and tarsal claws on legs and variation in characteristics of eyes among taxa are useful for identification. Accordingly, we used not only the necessary identification guides, e.g.
Deeleman-Reinhold (2001), Jocqué & Dippenaar-Schoeman (2007), but also literature relating to morphological characteristics of legs, for example Deeleman-Reinhold (2009), Wolff & Gorb (2012), Wolff et al. (2013), Labarque et al. (2017), and Ramírez & Michalik (2019), and literature relating to characteristics of eyes, for example Morehouse et al. (2017), and Long (2021). The aforementioned literature substantially support identification of spiders.
Fungal mycelia were scraped out from the surface of fungal colonies actively growing on PDA and DNA subsequently extracted following the protocol previously described by Thanakitpipattana et al. (2020). Five nuclear DNA regions were PCR-amplified including the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS), the nuclear large subunit (LSU) of the ribosomal DNA, translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1), and the largest and second-largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2). PCR reactions were done in 25 μL volumes consisting of 1× Dream Taq Buffer (containing 2.5 mM MgCl2), 0.4 M betaine, 200 μM dNTP mix, 0.5 μM of each primer, 1 U Dream Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, US) and 50 ng of DNA template.
DNA sequences were assembled using BioEdit v. 7.2.5 (Hall 1999). The alignment was conducted using MUSCLE v. 3.6 software (Edgar 2004) and manually corrected to minimise gaps. The final sequence alignment of 4 219 bps of the combined dataset was used for analyses using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Maximum likelihood-based phylogeny was performed with RAxML-HPC2 on XSEDE in CIPRES Science Gateway v. 3.3 (https://www.phylo.org/) using a GTRCAT model of evolution with 1 000 bootstrap replicates (Stamatakis 2014). Bayesian analysis was performed with MrBayes on XSEDE v. 3.2.7a using the best fit models of evolution (SYM+G) selected by AIC in MrModeltest v. 2.2 (Nylander 2004). Four Markov chains were run for 5 M generations and trees were sampled every 100 generations. A burn-in value of 25 % was set that discarded the first 2 500 generations.
P-distances were calculated between sequences using MEGA X (Kumar et al. 2018). P-distances were averaged between putative species. Other closely related known taxa were included in the analysis to evaluate whether the divergence among putatively new clades would support their status as distinct species. The p-distance between G. cebrennini and G. fusiformispora, two sister species proposed in a previous taxonomic work on Gibellula (Kuephadungphan et al. 2020), was used as a threshold to discriminate between closely related species.
According to the phylogenetic tree inferred from multiple loci of 47 taxa (Fig. 1 and Table 1), seven genera including Akanthomyces, Beauveria, Blackwellomyces, Cordyceps, Gibellula, Hevansia, and Engyodontium (as outgroup) formed monophyletic clades that corresponded to the phylogeny-based classification of the Cordycipitaceae contributed by Kepler et al. (2017), Kuephadungphan et al. (2019, 2020) and Wang et al. (2020). All taxa pertaining to this study were distributed in the strongly supported Gibellula clade (100 %), which is regarded as a sister lineage to Hevansia – another well-known specialised spider-parasitic genus along with Gibellula. This multilocus-based phylogeny clearly supports the segregation of three new records of known species, eight new taxa, and seven known species within the genus. New records in Thailand are reported for G. dimorpha, G. pulchra and G. unica. Gibellula dimorpha formed a strongly supported clade with Gibellula trimorpha, a new species. Gibellula brevistipitata, G. longicaudata, G. longispora, G. nigelii, G. parvula and G. pilosa were recognised as new taxa with strong bootstrap supports for their phylogenetic placements.
We calculated the p-distances between sequences constituting putative new species (G. brevistipitata, G. parvula, G. pilosa, G. solita and G. trimorpha), new records for Thailand (G. dimorpha, G. pulchra and G. unica) and between closely related known taxa in their respective clades (Fig. 1). The p-distance between G. cebrennini and G. fusiformispora (0.014 ± 0.003; ~ 1.4 % divergence) was used as a threshold of divergence between two closely related cryptic species of Gibellula.
Figure 2 shows the distribution of p-distances between putative new and closely related Gibellula species. The p-distance analysis supports G. dimorpha, G. trimorpha, G. parvula, G. pigmentosinum, G. longispora, G. brevistipitata, G. pilosa, G. solita, G. unica, G. pulchra, and G. nigelii as distinct species. These findings illustrate the cryptic trends in cordycipitoid morphological evolution as demonstrated in other works (Khonsanit et al. 2020, Kobmoo et al. 2019, 2021, Mongkolsamrit et al. 2018, 2020, Wang et al. 2020).

Material examined: Thailand, Ranong Province, Khuan Mae Yai Mon Wildlife Sanctuary, Heo Lom Waterfall, on Miagrammopes sp. attached to the underside of a dicot leaf, 9 Mar. 2011, K. Tasanathai, P. Srikitikulchai, A. Khonsanit, K. Sansatchanon & D. Thanakitpipattana (BBH30489, living culture BCC 47518). GenBank: ITS = MH532884, LSU = MH394679, TEF1 = MH521892, RPB1 = MH521819, RPB2 = MH521863.
Notes: Gibellula dimorpha was first described by Tzean et al. in the late 1990s and there has been no report on this species since then. In this study, we described for the first time G. dimorpha from Thailand; moreover, we obtained a culture of this species. Typically, G. dimorpha is recognised by having a Granulomanus conidial morph that develops aspergillus-like conidiophores and by producing broadly fusoid conidia in the Gibellula conidial morph. A Granulomanus conidiophore often bears both types of phialides: narrowly clavate, smooth-walled phialides, which is typically found in the Gibellula conidial morph and irregular-shaped, rough-walled phialides with 1–3 denticles. Remarkably, the narrowly clavate phialides of the Granulomanus conidial morph are significantly longer, (6–)7.5–10(–11) μm, than those found in the Gibellula conidial morph (6.5–8.5 μm). The size of the conidial heads varies over a wide range, in which the largest is up to 59 μm diam. In comparison to the type, the Thai specimen shared similarity in shape but shows difference in size (Table 2). For instance, the Thai specimen has Gibellula conidiophores, Granulomanus phialides and conidia that are much shorter than the type whereas the part-spores of the Torrubiella sexual morph are slightly longer.

White mycelia covering the body of a spider host, occasionally its legs (Fig. 6A). Multiple synnemata produced, cylindrical, attenuated, brown when dried, 5–5.5 mm long, 175–200 μm wide, narrowing upward to a slender tip, 62.5–75 μm wide, consisting of parallel multiseptated longitudinal hyphae (Fig. 6A–C).

Culture characteristics: Gibellula longispora was once established in culture on PDA. DNA was extracted and sequenced but unfortunately the culture lost its viability after storage.
Notes: Gibellula longispora has often been used as a representative of the genus Gibellula in phylogenetic analyses (Johnson et al. 2009, Kepler et al. 2011, Chiriví-Salomón et al. 2015, Thanakitpipattana et al. 2020). Gibellula longispora is in fact an invalid name which is not yet listed in the global fungal nomenclatural databases including Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org) and MycoBank (www.mycobank.org). In order to validate this name, the species is therefore morphologically described and illustrated herein. The specimen BBH8638 (formerly known as NHJ12014) is reminiscent of G. pulchra in having numerous synnemata and producing aspergillus-like conidiophores. Nonetheless, G. longispora distinctly differs from the type of G. pulchra (Cavara 1894) not only in the length of conidia which are twice as long as those of the type (Table 3), but also from the phylogenetic evidence that G. longispora is more closely related to G. parvula than to G. pulchra (Fig. 1).

Synnema arising from the posterior part of the host, cylindric, attenuated, approximately 3 mm long, 70 μm wide, white at the base, becoming brown to greenish brown upward, enlarging into inconspicuous swollen tip with acute apex (Fig. 7A–D). Conidiophores arising from outer layer of hyphal network of the synnema, absent in the lower part, scattered, occasionally septate at base, minutely roughened, (42.5–)55–85(–90) × 7.5–9.5(–10) μm, tapering abruptly in a slender apex and terminating into a swollen vesicle (Fig. 7E–F). Vesicles globose to subglobose, (7.5–)8.5–10.5(–11) μm diam bearing multiple metulae (Fig. 7G). Metulae broadly obovoid, (7–)7.5–9(–10) × (5–)5.5–6.5(–7) μm (Fig. 7G). Phialides borne on metulae, narrowly clavate to cylindrical, apically thickened, occasionally with very short neck, (6–)7–8(–9) × 2–2.5(–3) μm, each bearing a conidium (Fig. 7G). A vesicle, metulae and phialides forming a spherical conidial head, 38–41(–42) μm diam (Fig. 7E–G). Conidia ellipsoid, narrowly ovoid, sometimes with an acute end, (2.5–)3–3.5(–4) × 1–1.5 μm (Fig. 7H). Granulomanus synasexual morph and sexual morph not observed.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on PDA attaining a diam of 1.5 cm in 24 d at 25 °C, cottony, brownish white; reverse light brown, darkening with age, starting from the centre (Fig. 7I). Sporulation not observed in culture.
Notes: Besides G. longispora, G. nigelii (formerly known as G. pulchra NHJ 10808) has also frequently been included in phylogenetic analyses to represent G. pulchra (Johnson et al. 2009, Kepler et al. 2011, Chiriví-Salomón et al. 2015, Thanakitpipattana et al. 2020). However, morphological data indicate that NHJ10808 represents a different species. Even though G. nigelii and G. pulchra show morphological resemblance in having nearly the same microscopic characters, they can be distinguished from each other by the outer appearances. Gibellula pulchra typically produces numerous synnemata; however, G. nigelii formed only a single synnema and could thus not be assigned to the same species. In addition, the arrangement of conidiophores on synnemata appeared to be an informative character for species discrimination – the conidiophores are scattered in G. nigelii but crowded in G. pulchra. These differences together with the phylogenetic placements suggested proposing the strain NHJ 10808 as a new species.
Herein, the conidiophore lengths of G. nigelii might be inaccurate as the actual length might be longer. In general, the conidiophore is shorter the further up the synnema. To preserve the fungal specimens, only the upper part of a synnema (approximately 830 μm) was taken for the morphological study.

Notes: Among Gibellula spp. producing aspergillus-like conidiophores, G. longispora bears the greatest morphological resemblance to G. pulchra in having almost identical macroscopic and microscopic features. They can be distinguished from each other only by the shape of conidia – G. pulchra typically produces cylindrical, ellipsoid to ovoid conidia (Fig. 11) whereas G. longispora produces only bacilliform conidia which are significantly longer than those reported for G. pulchra. Even though their outer appearances can easily mislead species identification, the multilocus-based phylogenetic analysis showed very clear segregation between them by placing G. longispora far from G. pulchra (Fig. 1). Considering the sister clades of G. pulchra and G. nigelii, G. nigelii has markedly smaller conidia (Table 3). Since the number of synnemata and the arrangement of conidiophores on synnemata are important features used effectively in species discrimination within the genus Gibellula, G. pulchra can be simply distinguished from G. nigelii by forming numerous synnemata with crowded conidiophores (Fig. 10A–D) whereas G. nigelii produces a single synnema with scattered conidiophores.

Notes: In comparison with G. unica which was phylogenetically placed close to G. solita as a sister clade (Fig. 1), G. solita can be easily distinguished from G. unica in mostly having ovoid conidia with the length almost twice shorter as well as distinctly producing shorter conidiophores. However, it might be difficult to tell them apart based solely on the outer appearances as they both produce a single to a few long synnemata.

Notes: Gibellula trimorpha shows morphological resemblance to G. dimorpha (Tzean et al. 1998) in bearing three different reproductive morphs consisting of a Gibellula conidial morph, Granulomanus conidial morph and Torrubiella sexual morph. It displays a distinct feature of aspergillus-like conidiophores bearing both Gibellula and Granulomanus phialides. Morphological comparison between G. trimorpha and G. dimorpha did not show any significant difference as all characters share similarity in shape and size falling within nearly the same ranges (Table 2), making it difficult to discriminate these two species based solely on morphology. Even so, the phylogenetic evidence highly supported G. trimorpha as a new species.

Materials examined: Thailand, Kalasin Province, Phu Si Than Wildlife Sanctuary, Khok Pa Si Community Forest, on Pholcidae attached to the underside of dicot leaf, 24 Oct. 2010, A. Khonsanit (BBH30027, living culture BCC 45112 and BBH30034, living culture BCC 46590).
Notes: Besides G. trimorpha and G. dimorpha, G. unica is also known to have a Granulomanus conidial morph producing aspergillus-like conidiophores along with a Gibellula conidial morph. Nonetheless, G. unica can be distinguished from G. trimorpha and G. dimorpha by producing narrowly ellipsoidal Gibellula conidia instead of fusoid conidia. Moreover, its asexual-sexual link has not yet been found. Herein, we report G. unica from Thailand for the first time since the species was described (Tzean et al. 1997). We also provide the description of colony morphology and the evidence of sporulation on an artificial medium. The Thai specimens were found to be very similar to the type of G. unica by having all morphological features in common. The Thai specimens only show slight differences in the size of Gibellula (shorter than type) and Granulomanus (longer than type) conidia (Table 4). As the Granulomanus conidial morph could not be observed in specimen BBH30027, G. unica does not always produce a Granulomanus conidial morph along with a Gibellula morph.
Among Gibellula spp., G. pulchra has the longest and the most complicated nomenclatural history (Figs 10, 11). Several species were synonymised with G. pulchra (see Shrestha et al. 2019) causing confusion in the taxonomy of the genus. As G. pulchra is a cosmopolitan species, it has been recorded from many countries including Hawaii (USA), Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Guyana, Trinidad, Chile, Papua New Guinea (Mains 1950), Ghana (Samson & Evans 1973), Japan (Kobayasi 1977), Solomon Islands (Humber & Rombach 1987), Canada (Strongman 1991), Ecuador (Samson & Evans 1992), South Africa (Rong & Botha 1993), Taiwan (Tzean et al. 1997), Turkey (Selçuk et al. 2004), Thailand (Luangsa-ard et al. 2007) and Brazil (Costa 2014). According to the species description contributed by Mains (1950), Humber & Rombach (1987) and Tzean et al. (1997), G. pulchra can occur either in the absence or presence of a Torrubiella sexual morph or Granulomanus synasexual morph. Synnemata are numerous or solitary, clavate to cylindrical, yellow or yellowish white to brown or white or greyish or violet, violaceous brown to brown with age or when dried, sometimes slightly enlarged upwards of the tip, and consist of multiseptated longitudinal hyphae. Conidiophores arise from a network of hyphae loosely attached to the surface of the synnemata or occasionally from the mycelia covering the host body or legs. They are usually rough-walled and arranged in a hymenium along the length of synnemata, each abruptly tapering into a slender apex which subsequently enlarges into a globose, subglobose or obovoid vesicle which bears multiple broadly obovoid metulae. Phialides borne on metulae are narrowly clavate, thickened apically and sometimes extended into a short neck. A vesicle, together with multiple metulae and phialides, form a spherical head that bear either ovoid, fusoid, fusoid-ellipsoid or ellipsoid conidia. Conidia can be found singly or in chains. Based on these descriptions, the species proposed herein as G. longispora, G. nigelii, G. parvula as well as G. solita seemed to fit well with previous identifications as G. pulchra.
Based on our continuous survey and study of Gibellula, over 2 000 specimens exhibiting Gibellula traits have been collected, of which around 5 % were preliminarily identified as G. pulchra. However, multilocus phylogenetic analyses showed many of them to represent new species, including G. pigmentosinum. From our observations, G. pulchra can be recognised only by producing numerous whitish, greyish, yellowish to violaceous, cylindrical, attenuated, long synnemata with a tapered tip or slightly enlarged tip, long aspergillus-like conidiophores densely crowded on the surface and along the entire length of synnemata and forming fusoid to ellipsoid conidia either singly or in chains. These descriptions exclude G. nigelii, G. parvula and G. solita from G. pulchra sensu lato as they produce a single, a pair of two and a group of three synnemata, respectively, as well as G. longispora which produces long bacilliform conidia. Considering the specimen BBH30518, its morphology is strongly reminiscent of G. pulchra by having all characters similar to G. pulchra in both shape and size (Table 3). Owing to a lack of DNA sources of the type as well as the loss of original material, comparison between our specimen and the holotype is infeasible. To solve the problem of the lost holotype and a lack of its DNA sequences, epitypification and neotypification have been suggested (Ariyawansa et al. 2014). Nevertheless, our specimen with affinity to G. pulchra could not be designated as either epitype or neotype according to the epitypification and neotypification principle that the epitype or neotype should be obtained from the same location as the type, in this case Italy.
Considering the phylogenetic placements of G. longispora, G. nigelii, G. parvula, G. pulchra and G. solita, they were distinctly placed in different relatively well-supported clades representing separate species, consistent with morphology-based classification. Since these species have most of the morphological characters in common, only a few can be used to tell them apart. In our study the number of synnemata appears to be an informative feature that can discriminate G. parvula, G. nigelii and G. solita from G. longispora, and G. pulchra and G. nigelii from G. parvula and G. solita, whereas the shape of conidia can be used to distinguish G. longispora from G. pulchra and G. parvula from G. solita. However, due to the limited number of specimens studied for each taxon these observations may change.
Microscopic features including vesicles, metulae and phialides are considered to be inappropriate features for discriminating species that produce aspergillus-like conidiophores, because the sizes of these characters often fall into the same ranges with nearly identical shapes. Vesicles are commonly globose to subglobose, metulae are broadly obovoid to obovoid whereas phialides are often narrowly clavate to cylindrical. In addition to these characters, conidiophore length can sometimes appear to be a misleading feature. As conidiophores become shorter upwards the synnema, the length of conidiophores thus varies depending on where they are observed. Owing to the fact that fungal herbaria are supposed to preserve specimens under the best condition which forbids studying a whole synnema, particularly when only a single synnema is produced, the actual range of conidiophore lengths is rarely recorded.
The conidiophores of G. brevistipitata and G. pilosa can be measured along the entire length of synnemata, which is particularly useful for distinguishing these species. These two species produced aspergillus-like conidiophores that are at least twice as short in G. brevistipitata (47.5–)58–100(–115) μm than G. pilosa (140–)151–265(–420) μm (Table 5). Besides the length of conidiophores, the shape of synnematal tips and the length of synnemata are considered to be reliable characters for differentiating closely related species within Gibellula, including G. brevistipitata and G. pilosa, that are phylogenetically regarded as sister taxa (Fig. 1). Gibellula brevistipitata forms distinctly short synnemata with slightly enlarged ovoid tips, whereas G. pilosa produces longer synnemata with globose to subglobose apices (Fig. 6). Gibellula pilosa can be easily recognised at first glance by the numerous long conidiophores on the mycelia covering the host body and legs.
Among the proposed new species, G. longicaudata is the only one that produces penicillium-like conidiophores (Fig. 5). Thus far, only G. clavulifera, G. leiopus and G. scorpioides are known to produce such conidiophores. Based on morphology, G. longicaudata was found to be rather close to G. scorpioides by having a long cylindrical synnema arising from the posterior part of the spider host, and producing very short penicillium-like conidiophores bearing fusoid conidia. Table 6 shows the comparison of important morphological characters between these species. Interestingly, G. longicaudata was phylogenetically placed far from the ex-type strain of G. scorpioides, but rather close to G. cebrennini and G. fusiformispora that have penicillium-like conidiophores (Fig. 15B) instead of aspergillus-like conidiophores (Fig. 15A).
In this study, we also newly reported G. dimorpha and G. unica from Thailand. These two species are well-known to form a Granulomanus conidial morph that can develop aspergillus-like conidiophores. The Thai specimen BBH30034 was found to be morphologically similar to G. unica from Taiwan in having white mycelia, a few synnemata on the spider hosts, aspergillus-like conidiophores bearing narrowly ellipsoid conidia and a Granulomanus synasexual morph forming gibellula-like conidiophores. The morphological characters of the specimens from different countries showed the same shapes and sizes falling into the same ranges with some minor differences (Table 4, see notes for the species). In contrast, specimen BBH30489 was morphologically reminiscent of G. dimorpha (Tzean et al. 1998). Based on the comparison of morphological characters between BBH30489 and the type, they share similarities in shape but not size of characters (Table 2, also see notes for the species). The morphological differences between these specimens and a lack of DNA sequence data corresponding to the type have thus left us to question whether our specimen truly represents a new species or falls within the species boundary of G. dimorpha. To avoid introducing taxonomic confusion by proposing a new species from the fungus that might later turn out to be the described species, we decided to assign Gibellula strain BBH30489 to G. dimorpha. With regard to its sister clade, G. trimorpha appeared to be very much closer to G. dimorpha in having all morphological characters in common which could easily mislead species identification. Nevertheless, the molecular traits segregated them into two taxa (Fig. 1). Although morphological data of some certain characters of G. trimorpha remains incomplete, the molecular evidence was sufficient to propose it as a new species.
Recently, Lücking et al. (2020) raised awareness of how not only phenotypes can mislead the identification of cryptic species, but also how a single morphologically well-defined species can possess a complex genetic structure. The approach of integrative (polyphasic) taxonomy is highly suggested for accurate species delimitation to overcome these obstacles. For closely related species with typically few distinguishing characters, phylogeny-based classification and identification is important. Nevertheless, it is sometimes questionable whether the observed genetic divergence between putative species could be considered as sufficient for proposing a new species. One approach is to use the genetic distance between known sister species in a given taxonomic group as a threshold for assignment of species status (Baker & Bradley 2006). Although this approach is not widespread in fungal taxonomy, it has been used successfully in some studies (Ophiocordyceps unilateralis: Kobmoo et al. 2012, O. myrmecophila: Khonsanit et al. 2019) and is useful for proposing new species. Using the divergence between G. cebrennini and G. fusiformispora as the threshold, G. longicaudata, G. longispora, G. nigelii, G. parvula, G. pilosa, G. solita and G. trimorpha could be proposed as new species. Particular attention should be paid to the taxa BCC45580 and BCC57817 in which the divergence between them was just below the threshold. However, the morphological evidence strongly supported the segregation between them. From the integrative phylogeny considering the morphological and genetic data together, G. brevistipitata and G. pilosa were thus proposed to accommodate these taxa, respectively.
To identify species of invertebrate-parasitic fungi those that have a narrow host range or are restricted to a single host, host specificity was suggested to be a very informative character (Johnson 1968, Evans et al. 2011, Vialle et al. 2013, Araújo et al. 2018).
The identification of the spider hosts of Gibellula spp. at the family ranks was first made by Van der Bijl (1922), who reported Lycosidae as a host of G. haygarthii, which is now synonymised with G. pulchra (Shrestha et al. 2019). Later, many attempts were made to identify the hosts of several species of Gibellula at the genus and species ranks (Petch 1948, Samson & Evans 1973, 1977, Strongman 1991, Costa 2014, Savić et al. 2016). Nevertheless, host specificity has not yet been clearly determined for most Gibellula species. For instance, the host morphologies of G. leiopus and G. pulchra reported by Savić et al. (2016) and Strongman (1991), respectively, seemed not to fit well the concepts of the individual species. In our previous study, we also attempted to identify the spider hosts parasitised by four new species of Gibellula (Kuephadungphan et al. 2020). Therein, Cebrenninus cf. magnus, Storenomorpha sp. and Portia sp. appeared to be exclusively associated to G. cebrennini, G. pigmentosinum and G. scorpioides, respectively, whereas the family Deinopidae was described for the first time as a host for G. fusiformispora. In total, Gibellula hosts have been reported among 16 spider families thus far (Table 7).
Salticidae is the largest family of spiders, and several Gibellula species have been reported to parasitise salticid spiders, including G. pulchra in this study, confirming a previous study by Samson & Evans (1973). Besides G. pulchra, other species of Gibellula parasitising salticid spiders include G. clavulifera (Samson & Evans 1977), G. clavulifera var. alba (Humber & Rombach 1987) and three new species reported in this study (G. longispora, G. pilosa and G. trimorpha). Gibellula trimorpha also appeared on Oxyopidae indicating that is not restricted to a single spider species and can infect a broad host range across multiple spider families.
According to Shrestha et al. (2019), Linyphiidae, the second largest family of spiders after the Salticidae (World Spider Catalog 2021) has so far been reported as the hosts of only a few species of hypocrealean fungi including Cordyceps sp. from Panama (Nentwig 1985), G. pulchra and Torrubiella albolanata from the British Isles (Petch 1944, 1948) and Gibellula sp. from Brazil (Costa 2014). In this study, this spider family was found to be infected by G. nigelii. Interestingly, although at least 46 species of Linyphiidae spiders have been reported in Thailand, none of them have previously been reported to be mummified by any hypocrealean fungi. Therefore, to our knowledge, this study includes the first report of Linyphiidae as the host of hypocrealean fungi from Asia.
Theridiidae, also known as tangle-web spiders, cobweb spiders, and comb-footed spiders is one of the largest spider families in the world, ranking among the top five most diverse families with over 120 described genera (World Spider Catalog 2021). Certain genera including Achaearanea, Argyrodes, Carniella, Chrysso, Coleosoma, Coscinida, Dipoena, Episinus, Janula, Latrodectus, Meotipa, Parasteatoda, and Theridion (Knoflach 1996, Chotwong & Tanikawa 2013, Wongprom & Košulič 2016, Chaiphongpachara et al. 2019, World Spider Catalog 2021, Petcharad & Tanikawa, unpublished data) have been recorded from Thailand but none has previously been reported to be hosts of hypocrealean fungi. Nonetheless, other members of this family are known to be exclusively associated with Gibellula, including Helvibis longicauda that was found to be parasitised by Gibellula cf. pulchra (Gonzaga et al. 2006), and Neopisinus cf. cognatus, and Janula bicornigera that were the hosts of two unidentified Gibellula (Marques et al. 2011, Costa 2014, World Spider Catalog 2021). In the current study, G. parvula and G. solita were also found growing on members of Theridiidae. However, the host could not be identified at the species nor genus rank. Host identification is important for further study of the fungus/host interaction as the fungus may require specific nutrients from certain hosts, or the physiology or behaviour of the spider could facilitate the fungal infection. Gonzaga et al. (2006) noted different susceptibility of two Theridiidae species (Chrysso intervales and H. longicauda) to Gibellula fungal attack. These spiders are known to share similarities in body size, web placement as well as habitat selection; however, the latter appeared to encounter Gibellula more frequently in nature.
Myrmarachne is a family of ant-mimetic spiders that was found to include a host of G. longispora in this study. It is worth pursuing whether G. longispora can be found on other spiders beyond Myrmarachne or not. As the exoskeleton structure is different between insects and spiders (Evans 2013, Machałowski 2020), a focus on pathogenic fungi parasitising Myrmarachne spiders and the ant species mimicked by the spider would provide insight on whether the exoskeleton is the main factor driving the evolution of Gibellula. Interestingly, as Myrmarachne spiders tend to be herbivores or nectarivores rather than carnivores in comparison with other spiders (Jackson et al. 2001, Jackson et al. 2008, Nyffeler et al. 2017, Hashimoto et al. 2020), nutrients could be a key factor driving the speciation of G. longispora.
In the spider family Pholcidae, Metagonia aff. beni was reported as a host of an unidentified Gibellula (Costa 2014). In this study, two isolates were assigned to G. unica that parasitised unidentified species of Pholcidae. The morphology of the aforementioned specimen illustrated by Costa (2014) is reminiscent of G. unica by the outer appearance and the presence of both Gibellula and Granulomanus anamorphic states on the same specimen. Metagonia is distributed only in the Americas (World Spider Catalog 2021); hence, the Pholcidae host of G. unica identified in this study is unlikely to belong to Metagonia.
Miagramopes sp. is a member of the spider family Uloboridae, which is mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions (World Spider Catalog 2021) and was found herein to be parasitised by G. dimorpha. This fungus is a cosmopolitan species reported in Taiwan (Tzean et al. 1998), Thailand (Luangsa-ard et al. 2010), probably Brazil (Costa 2014), and Japan (Shrestha et al. 2019).
Thomisidae are widely known as crab spiders with more than 2 100 species currently described. Only a few among them have ever been reported as prey for the invertebrate-parasitic fungi. This includes Cebrenninus cf. magnus as the host for G. cebrennini (Kuephadungphan et al. 2020), Tmarus for Gibellula spp. (Costa 2014) and unidentified thomisid spiders for Torrubiella albolanata (Petch 1944) and Torrubiella fusiformis (Kobayasi & Shimizu 1982). Based on Ramírez (2014), Wongprom & Košulič (2016), World Spider Catalog (2021), in addition to Cebrenninus, there are 16 Thomisidae genera reported in Thailand including Amyciaea, Angaeus, Boliscus, Borboropactus, Camaricus, Epidius, Misumenops, Oxytate, Pagida, Pharta, Platythomisus, Runcinia, Smodicinodes, Thomisus, Tmarus, Zygometis. However, in the present study, G. longicaudata was found on an Indoxysticus host that we report as Thomisidae cf. Indoxysticus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Indoxysticus in Thailand. Furthermore, G. brevistipitata was also found in this study to parasitise a Thomisidae host; however, the host could not be identified unequivocally to even the genus rank.
Identifying a spider to the species rank is challenging, which is made more difficult when dealing with a spider fully covered with fungal mycelia that obscure the spider’s morphological features. The tarsal claws and scopulate are the most informative characters when the legs appear to be the only part slightly covered by fungal mycelia (Kuephadungphan et al. 2020). However, the identification of such a spider to the species rank without severely damaging the fungus highly requires experienced araneologists, and preferably, fresh specimens from fieldwork (Savić et al. 2016, Kuephadungphan et al. 2020). To promote the investigation of araneophagous fungi, we herein provide a simple protocol of how to handle the specimens in the Methods section. To enable the isolation of spider-parasitic fungi, the parasitised spiders are preferably delivered to mycologists within the same day they are collected. The molecular data generated from pure cultures often gives much more accurate identification to the species level when it is not feasible to obtain DNA from the fungal stroma. In the case that the specimens cannot be transferred to mycologists or within a day, they can be stored at 4 °C or air-dried. However, the longer they are stored, the lower chance they can be established in cultures.
During our field work for this study, several observations were made that raise the possibility of manipulation of spider behaviour by Gibellula during infection. Gibellula were noticeably found only on Araneomorphae spiders, whereas these fungi have never been reported on Mygalomorphae (Shrestha et al. 2019, Kuephadungphan et al. 2020), suggesting that Gibellula is only able to infect the very thin body surface of the former. The exoskeletal parts of the abdomen and leg joints are much thinner than that of other body parts (Jocqueì & Dippenaar-Schoeman 2007, Peìrez-Miles 2020, Göttler et al. 2021a, b) and are much softer after molting (Baerg 1926, Stefoff 2009, Foelix 2011), making them the most vulnerable entry parts for infection, as well as the joints which are composed by thin membranes. Gibellula infection thus probably initiates from spores that contact the abdomen or leg joints during molting, which then invade the haemocoel and proliferate via a budding yeast-like phase (Evans 2013), eventually reaching the cephalothorax in which a brain is located and spreading to the appendages via hemolymph. Once the fungus has invaded the brain, the spider’s behaviour could be manipulated to enhance fungal growth and dispersal creating “zombie” spiders. The indirect evidence supporting zombie spiders includes 1) the frequency of Gibellula-infected cadavers that were found to be firmly attached to the underside of leaves (97.67 %, n = 43) (Kuephadungphan & Petcharad unpubl. data), seems to be not a coincidence as in nature, spiders could randomly stay on the upper surface and underside of leaves (Petcharad pers. obs., Jackson 1986, Li et al. 1999, Pekár 2005, Huber & Schütte 2009, Suter et al. 2011, Roff & Haddad 2015, Uetz & Dillery 2017, Guarisco 2018), and 2) the cadavers of web-building spiders, such as Theridiidae that were found dead off their webs where they spend much of their life time on (Gonzaga et al. 2006, Kuephadungphan & Petcharad, unpubl. data) seems to be abnormal. In addition, signs of behaviour manipulation by G. scorpioides on the spider assassin Portia were reported previously (Kuephadungphan et al. 2020). With their thin exoskeleton, desiccation is a significant stress to Araneomorphae spiders (Oxbrough et al. 2005, Ziesche & Roth 2008, Canal et al. 2015, Kwok & Eldridge 2016) and moisture is a limiting factor for araneophagous fungi to grow (Hajek & Leger 1994). The propensity of Gibellula-infected spiders to be found on the underside of leaves could be a consequence of behavior for maintaining moisture via avoidance of sunlight exposure.
A survey of the spider-parasitic genus Gibellula led to the discovery of eight new taxa along with three new records from Thailand of previously described species. Among the new species, G. nigelii was herein proven to represent a new taxon that had previously been used to represent the type species G. pulchra in the phylogeny of Cordycipitaceae. New data validate G. longispora as a species. Divergence within the genus was estimated from DNA sequence data and shown to be useful in species delimitation of closely related taxa. In addition to the morphological descriptions and DNA sequence data of the fungi, the spider hosts were carefully examined to determine whether the host specificity can aid in species identification of Gibellula and to extend our understanding of the spider-fungus association. Most of the spiders being examined could be identified to the family rank. Although this did not give much information on the species delimitation of Gibellula, several observations of the hosts indicated aspects of the interaction between spiders and Gibellula that are worth further pursuing such as behavioural modification.
The following taxa are accepted species of Gibellula based on their species descriptions and/or phylogenetic placements. These has been compiled in part from Shrestha et al. (2019).
Gibellula clavulifera (Petch) Samson & H.C. Evans, Proc. K. Ned. Akad. Wet., Ser. C, Biol. Med. Sci. 80: 131. 1977. MycoBank MB 314478.
Synonym: Gibellula clavulifera var. clavulifera (Petch) Samson & H.C. Evans, Proc. K. Ned. Akad. Wet., Ser. C, Biol. Med. Sci. 80: 131. 1977.
Synonym: Gibellula araneae Sawada, Rep. Dept Agric., Govern. Res. Inst. Formosa, Spec. Bull. Agric. Exp. Station Formosa 35: 114. 1928. MycoBank MB 257173.
The following species of Gibellula could not be confidently assigned to the genus as their morphologies did not fit the concept of the genus or the molecular phylogeny presented is inconclusive or unavailable.
Note: Petch (1932) expressed doubt towards the identity of G. aspergilliformis because of the narrow metulae and spherical conidia in chains present in this species were uncommon features of Gibellula.
Note: According to Mains (1950), the description of G. capillaris did not fit the concept of Gibellula and re-examination of the type specimen is infeasible as it is no longer in a good condition.
Note: Judging by the species illustration, Gibellula curvispora does not fit the concept of Gibellula. Importantly, its ITS sequence appeared close to Bionectriaceae.
Note: Mains (1950) expressed doubt on the assignment of Gibellula formosana Sawada to the genus since it was found infecting a moth while Kobayasi suggested that it resembled Isaria japonica.
Note: Since Gibellula is well-known as an obligate parasite of spiders, Mains (1950) reported that the assignment of G. elegans to this genus might be erroneous, as this species is found parasitising locusts.
Notes: It is still unclear whether the species name should be retained or abandoned. Gibellula petchii was proposed to accommodate Cylindrophora aranearum, which was originally described as the conidial morph of Torrubiella albolanata and later elevated to generic rank as a new genus, Granulomanus (Petch 1944, de Hoog 1978, Humber & Rombach 1987). From the point of view of Humber & Rombach (1987), Granulomanus should be synonymised with Gibellula as it almost never occurs in the absence of Gibellula and/or its torrubiella-ike teleomorph. Cylindrophora aranearum (≡Granulomanus aranearum) was henceforth synonymised with G. petchii. On the other hand, Samson & Evans (1992) argued that Granulomanus naturally occurs independently on spider hosts either with or without Gibellula. Thus, the genus should be retained as an independent asexually typified genus resulting in rejection of G. petchii. According to a recent taxonomic revision of the Cordycipitaceae, which was largely based on molecular data, several generic names including Granulomanus were suppressed (Kepler et al. 2017). Nevertheless, the taxonomic dilemma of G. petchii cannot yet be resolved owing to the lack of sequence data.
Note: Petch (1932) expressed doubt towards the identity of G. phialobosia because of its flask-shaped phialides regarded as an uncommon feature of Gibellula.

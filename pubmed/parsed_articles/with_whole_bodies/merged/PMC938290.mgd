Canadian Respiratory Therapist COVID-19 vaccination uptake rates and responses were investigated with a look at the reasons behind any delays or non-vaccinations as well as other demographics, attitudes, or factors that may be shown to play a role. An anonymous survey using SurveyMonkey® on vaccination uptake rates, responses, and attitudes was available to Student, Graduate, and Registered Respiratory Therapists in Canada from July to October of 2021. A total of 1066 surveys (8.4% of target population) were started, 983 in English and 83 in French with 1013 completed fully and included in the data analysis. Canadian RT Vaccination uptake rates were compared to those of all Canadian healthcare workers which showed that 90.42% of the surveyed RT population in Canada received their vaccination right away compared to the posted rate at the time of 86.27% for all Canadian Healthcare Workers.Pearson Chi-Square Tests were performed to evaluate association between vaccination status and other categorical parameters evaluated in the survey. There was a significant (P = 0.013) association between early vaccination and age, a significant (P = 0.036) association between vaccination status and participants’ response on whether or not they have a family member or know someone who has had COVID-19, a significant (P < 0.001) association between vaccination status and attitudes towards trusting science to develop safe, effective, new vaccines, and a significant (P < 0.001) association between vaccination status and attitudes towards trusting the Ministry of Health to ensure that vaccines are safe. There was no significant association between vaccination status and gender, province/territory of residency/work, level of education, level of involvement with COVID-19 patients. The results suggest that the RT groups across Canada had higher early vaccination uptake rates than the general Healthcare worker groups and that age, relationship to people with COVID-19 and trust in science played a significant role in their vaccination uptake rates.
We are pleased to present the two winning abstracts from the RT and Student category poster presentations that were displayed virtually between May 13 and 14, 2022. As evidenced the by following abstracts, the work of our colleagues in 2022 highlights current research and practice innovations led by respiratory therapists and students.
The editorial board looks forward to receiving manuscripts from this conference for consideration for publication in the Canadian Journal of Respiratory Therapy to continue building the body of knowledge specific to our profession. Please note these abstracts have not been peer reviewed.

Precise and dynamically regulated force transmission between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a requirement for cell migration, tissue repair, and, more broadly, the construction of multicellular animal life. In addition, the talin rod domain is constructed of a series of helical bundle domains that unfold under loads of 5 to 25 pN (2–4) to expose multiple binding sites for the F-actin–binding protein vinculin (5), which is thought to reinforce the adhesion. G) Force trace and stage displacement as described in F. If one or more ABS3 molecules on the platform bead bind to the actin filament while the stage is moving, one of the trapped beads is pulled out of its equilibrium position (demarcated by the blue force trace), thus applying load to the ABS3–F-actin bond. A) An asymmetry in bond lifetimes is observed for a single actin filament. We next determined whether long-lived binding events corresponded to load oriented toward the F-actin barbed (+) or pointed (−) end by using a previously reported assay in which the polarity of a given actin filament is determined using the activity of a myosin VI construct (Fig. In total, a reasonable interpretation is that 1) definitively monomeric ABS3 (ABS3-ΔDD) binds F-actin only transiently under load, 2) the DD is required for stable F-actin binding under load, and 3) each dissociation step we observe reflects the coordinated detachment within our temporal resolution of an ABS3 dimer from F-actin. However, at a conceptual level, this requires only a binding interaction with F-actin that is asymmetric with respect to the intrinsic polarity of the actin filament as, for example, is seen in the electron microscopy structures of ABS3 and the vinculin F-actin–binding domain bound to F-actin (8, 29). Full details in SI Appendix, Extended Materials and Methods. Actin filament polarity was explicitly determined as described previously for a subset of the data in which flow cells were prepared with a myosin VI construct consisting of porcine myosin VI (residues 1 to 817) and Archaeoglobus fulgidus L7Ae (residues 9 to 118) with a C-terminal eYFP (38) on one-half of the flow cell (22). ABS3 was diluted in a 384-well plate (ref.

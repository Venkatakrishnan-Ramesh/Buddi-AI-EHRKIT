Severe burn patients often have anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1 However, the patient in this case was very nervous and exhibited a long-term high-frequency startle response. (2) Startle response caused by gene mutation, such as GLRA1 and GlyT2, usually occurs in infancy and can be improved by clonazepam.15,16 Because he had no history of startle response and clonazepam had the little curative effect, gene mutations were excluded. Since tearing might slow down the recovery of the injuries in his eyes, relaxation therapy was conducted.

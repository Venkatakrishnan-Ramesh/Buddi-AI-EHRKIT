Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv for peer-reviewed articles, preprints, and research reports on risk and health care evaluation for COVID-19 using the search terms “hospital occupancy mortality rate”, “ratio of total deaths to hospital occupancy”, and “ratio of hospital occupancy to case” up to 20 January 2022. No similar concepts or studies were found. We also provide evidence that explains why COVID-19 CFR has such dramatic changes at the beginning of a COVID-19 outbreak. Fold decrease for TDHR and HCR between May 2020 and December 2020 were used to calculate the contributions to the CFR changes. Length of stay in the hospital for deaths and discharges are useful fatality risk measurements for the COVID-19 pandemic because they reveal risk information for severe cases, which is missing in the CFR calculation. Linear regression was used to estimate average length of hospital stay for COVID-19 deaths and discharges. The linear regression equations and r2 values are included when applicable. a-c, risk monitoring for 28 countries from 24 March 2020 to 15 November 2021 with a, TDHOR. Genomic surveillance has shown that Omicron variant has spread to the many countries after Omicron was first discovered on 24 November 2021 based on samples collected on 11 November 2021 in South Africa.15,27 It raises serious concerns due to a much higher transmission rate and potential immune escape compared to the Delta variant.28The Omicron variant accounted for 58·6% of US new cases as of 25 December 2021, as estimated by the US CDC.29 One of the most important questions is whether the variant increases severe rate or hospitalization-to-case ratio (HCR). In particular, the UK and the US had decreases in mean week HOCR by 34·08% and 65·16% respectively (Figure 3e-f, Table 3), which mimics the hospitalization-to-cases ratio in these countries. Here, in addition to describing the concept and the relationships of HOMR, TDHOR, HOCR, CFR, and HMR, we have applied them to estimate the length of hospital stay in 34 states.

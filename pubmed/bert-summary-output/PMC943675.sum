Leishmania parasites use multiple strategies to thrive in mammalian phagocytes. These hits were particularly enriched in SUMOylation factors. Previously, we demonstrated that these macrophages use CD36-like scavenger receptors to phagocytose and control proliferation of L. amazonensis in the hemolymph of adult flies (Okuda et al., Potential hits that also affected SL2 cell proliferation are marked with green dots (195 in total).(C and D) 61 hits were validated with independent dsRNAs and then examined for their effect on the internalization of E. coli and S. aureus particles. We then used this assay to identify factors required for the internalization of L. amazonensis into SL2 cells by performing a genome-wide RNAi screen with a library of 13,071 dsRNAs covering nearly the entire Drosophila genome (Ambion). This loss of SUMOylation was not due to total protein degradation or sample loading issues, as normal levels total protein were observed by Coomassie Blue staining of the same membrane after immunoblotting (Figure 2 at the bottom of each blot).Figure 2Leishmania amastigote infection reduces SUMOylation in mouse and human macrophagesMacrophages (A and B - mouse BMDM, C - THP-1 human macrophages) were infected with amastigotes (MOI of 5) or promastigotes (MOI of 10), and at indicated times cells were lysed, separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting for SUMO1 (A) or SUMO2/3 (B, C). Heat shock induced a strong SUMOylation of high molecular weight proteins in non-infected cells (NI) and only slightly in infected cells. Anti-actin loading control shows comparable signals in each sample. We hypothesized that protein SUMOylation attenuates amastigote proliferation, and the inhibition of SUMOylation by Leishmania amastigotes could be a virulence mechanism to enhance their survival or replication within macrophages. PMA-induced macrophages were infected with amastigotes and parasite loads in knockdown and control cell lines scored. Mean of three independent samples with SD, each with at least 256 cells, analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey multi-comparison test.(E and F) Constitute expression of HA-SUMO2 reduced parasite loads in THP-1 macrophages compared to cells transduced with control lentivirus. Indeed, macrophages with knockdown of SUMO1 or SUMO2 presented larger PVs than control cells (Figures 3G and 3H), consistent with the hypothesis that disruption of macrophage SUMOylation enhances parasite growth and favors PV maturation. The mechanisms driving the PV biogenesis are of great interest but still poorly understood. Moreover, ATP6V0D2 expressing RAW 264.7 cells presented higher levels of free cholesterols compared to control cells transduced with empty vectors (CTRL) (Figure 5A). E) Representative images from at least 3 indpendent data sets. 2), SL2) was isolated from several hundred 20 to 24 hour Drosophila melanogaster embryo (Schneider, 1972) and distributed to several researchers worldwide. Number of SL2 cells (Hoechst 33342 staining), total parasites (GFP positive), and extracellular parasites (GFP and AlexaFluor 594 positive), intracellular parasites (GFP positive and AlexaFluor 594 negative) were scored and averaged for the three images of each well. Fluorescein-labeled E. coli (K-12 strain), and Staphylococcus aureus (Wood strain, without protein A) (Invitrogen), were washed 3 times with PBS by centrifugation and sonicated for 3 times at 50 kHz for 20 s. Twenty micrograms of bacterial particles were added to each well at 4°C, the plates were centrifuged 300xg for 3 min at 4°C, and incubated in a 27°C water bath for 20 or 40 min (for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively). Cells were selected with puromycin for 3 days before use.

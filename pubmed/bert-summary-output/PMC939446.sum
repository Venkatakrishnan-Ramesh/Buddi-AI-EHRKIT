This study is part of a large-scale molecular phylogenetic and morphological revision of the /Cyanula clade of the genus Entoloma in Europe to be published in due course (Dima et al. Total DNA of most of the samples was extracted from 15–30 mg of dry material, using a NucleoSpin Plant II Mini Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Pileus 10–40 mm diam, convex to conico-convex then applanate, sometimes depressed to umbilicate at the centre, not hygrophanous, not translucently striate or up to half the radius in well hydrated specimens, vivid blue (Italian collection) to dark blue or blue grey, almost black at centre, paler, more grey-tinged in old specimens, especially at the margin, finely fibrillose-tomentose, more squamulose towards the centre. Typus: Denmark, Sjælland, Lejre, Helvigstrup Skov, terrestrial in damp humus, with Alnus glutinosa, Frangula alnus and ferns in undergrowth, 14 Sep. 2019, T. Kehlet (holotype DMS-10034015, C) – ITS sequence, GenBank ON008485. Notes: Entoloma indikon is a sister species of E. phaeodiscum (Vila & Caballero 2007) from which it differs in colour of the pileus and stipe, the pileus often becoming deeply translucently striate, the more distinctly fibrillose stipe surface and the heterogeneous to sterile lamella edge. Pigment pale brown, intracellular in pileipellis. Notes: Entoloma precipuum belongs to the /Griseocyaneum clade, where is takes a rather isolated position (data not shown). Basidia 25–36 × 9.5–12.5 μm, subclavate, remarkably constricted, round base, 4-spored. Notes: Entoloma perchalybeum shares many characters with E. chalybeum, particularly when fresh on account of the very similar colour, non-translucently striate, squamulose pileus, polished stipe and blue tinge in the lamellae, but the pileus becomes quickly translucently striate when maturing (cf. Pigment parietal, probably also pale intracellular in pileipellis; also rarely minutely encrusting in lower parts of pileipellis.

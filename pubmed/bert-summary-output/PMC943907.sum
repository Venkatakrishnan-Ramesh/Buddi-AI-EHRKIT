Osteoporosis is a common disease that primarily endangers the health of middle-aged and older adults. The participants’ demographic characteristics before scanning were recorded. A) Volume rendering view of a quantitative computed tomography scan. ( BMD measured by QCT was 68.80 ± 10.65 mg/cm3 for the osteoporosis group and 148.38 ± 20.13 mg/cm3 for the normal group, compared with a HAP (average) as measured by DesCT of 76.15 ± 12.12 mg/cm3 and 142.96 ± 18.72 mg/cm3, respectively; the differences were significant (both p < 0.01). Previous studies20,21 have reported that DesCT can be used to measure BMD; however, differences in the methodologies used exist between studies. In this study, the HAP (water) value measured by the DesCT material separation technology was lower than that of the corresponding area by QCT, which is consistent with the results of Mei et al.25 The in vivo measurement of QCT BMD is affected by the vertebral body’s fat content,26 while the energy spectrum material separation technology uses HAP (water) as the basis material to measure BMD. Although the differences between DesCT and QCT were significant in the osteoporosis group, but the diagnostic consistency between the two methods was good.

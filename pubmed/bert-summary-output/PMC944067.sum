According to a report by the Tear Film & Ocular Surface Society Dry Eye Workshop in 2017, evaporative DED is more common than aqueous-deficiency DED.4 Evaporative DED results from excessive loss of water due to exposed ocular surface despite normal lacrimal secretion. Subjects were asked to respond by placing a vertical line across the horizontal line of the VAS. Bar graphs represent the mean reduction from baseline in OSDI score. Indicates statistically significant p values. Error bars represent the standard errors. ( C) For watching TV, the LS mean difference was 0.4 Â± 0.16, 95% CI = (0.1, 0.8), pANCOVA = 0.0076. * Figure 4TearCare decreased dry eye frequency assessed by Symptom Assessment Questionnaire in Dry Eye (SANDE) in the subgroup with more severe disease. For subjects with less severe blockage in the meibomian gland, both LipiFlow and TearCare presented as effective treatments since the two devices significantly reduced the total OSDI score, OSDI subsection scores, total SANDE score, and SANDE score for severity and frequency from baseline.

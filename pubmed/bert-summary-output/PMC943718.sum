The aim of this study was to determine whether it is possible to predict the occurrence of clinical exponents of the oculocardiac reflex by ANS tone, as determined by noninvasive electrocardiography Holter monitoring. In the ophthalmology ward, an electrocardiogram (ECG) Holter monitor with a digital sampling rate of 180 s/sec/channel (H3+; Mortara Rangoni Europe, Bologna, Italy) was connected to the patient approximately 30 min before the planned initiation of anaesthesia, and recording commenced. Fentanyl was given again before the surgeon started the operation. From this point onwards, an OCR reflex is expected. Hypotension during the OCR was observed only in four patients. Because the OCR (TCR) is a result of sympathetic and parasympathetic imbalance, our aim was to determine whether there was a correlation between the activity of a patient’s autonomic system, measured before anaesthesia and before surgical manipulation, and the occurrence of OCR [15]. However, the statistical analysis in the present study did not show any relationship between the incidence of OCR and pre-induction and presurgical manoeuvre autonomic tone, heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure, age, sex or ASA class. Cooperation between the surgeon and the anaesthesiologist is of great importance for the safe management of patients [28, 29] during surgery, particularly during the manipulation of the first muscle [30].According to a literature review by Arnold [31], the oculocardiac reflex may not be consistently predictable or preventable in a population of children with strabismus.

β–cell apoptosis is a key factor in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Critical factor in this process is thioredoxin–interacting protein, TXNIP - a part of α-arrestin family. Activation of AKT increases glucose uptake for energy storage in muscle and adipose tissues, as well as for energy consumption in fast dividing cells, such as in cancer. TXNIP is also an adaptor for the basal endocytosis of GLUT-4 and its absence allows rapid glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissues, which causes hypoglycemia during fasting. TXNIP inhibits NO production in endothelium and the production of iNOS is significantly increased in TXNIP gene knockout mice [25]. It has been shown that not only TXNIP suppresses NO generation and its biological effects, but also NO inhibits expression of TXNIP mRNA [26,27]. Those changes are accompanied by decreased vascular endothelial growth factor, concurrent with increased expression of reactive oxygen species and vascular cell adhesion molecule–1 in the aortic endothelium. There was no statistically significant difference in serum glucose level between verapamil-users and non-users.

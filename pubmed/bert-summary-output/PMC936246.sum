In the UK, there were small but insignificant differences in cumulative case fatality of thrombosis with concurrent thrombocytopenia (thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS]) following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria), by age but not sex. According to case definitions, a platelet count < 150 × 109/L meets the criteria for TTS [3, 8]. No definition has been provided within the MHRA’s weekly summary, only that reports concern thromboembolic events with concurrent low platelets [6]. This should be noted when interpreting the results of this analysis. Of the events reported to the MHRA, no statistical differences in fatality were observed based on age or sex.

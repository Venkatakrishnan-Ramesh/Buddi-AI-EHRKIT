Accordingly, the scientific community has also focused on non-thermal outcomes, which are not as obvious as the thermal ones [ 11and Wi-Fi technology consists of a “family” of wireless network protocols based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE 8211) standards. The selected source of RFR was a Wi-Fi router, configured properly for the experiment [ 1A laptop was connected to the router and exchanged data at 1.6 Mbps during the whole experimental process, which lasted 24 h.The selected method does not compromise with the standards, in which readings of the inhibition zones are done after 18 or 24 h,Additionally, the current study aimed to observe and measure the differences produced by the effect of non-ionizing radiation on a biological factor,such as antibiotic susceptibility. The diameter of the zone was proportional toEvery three hours, the plates were removed from the chambers for the measurements and were then reinserted to continue with the process of incubation.

Early and accurate detection of brain metastases (BMs) is vital for effective treatment. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the standard of care for eligible patients with limited BMs4,5 because neurocognitive function is better maintained with SRS than with whole-brain radiation therapy.6 Additionally, growing evidence supports SRS as a monotherapy for patients with multiple BMs.7–10 The development of even small BMs alters the tumor stage, and the number of BMs impacts treatment decisions. In this way, the cascaded networks focused on effectively removing FPs in the detection results and improving the overall performance based on the bagging training concept.30 BMD architecture details are provided in Supplementary Material 3 and Supplementary Figures 1 and 2. The readers were instructed to mark each lesion. The lesion-based detection sensitivity, free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC), the number of FPs per scan were evaluated, and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess BMD performance. Furthermore, our model achieved the highest reported sensitivity of 89% (134/151) for detecting BMs ≤ 3 mm and 97% (173/178) for BMs ≥ 10 mm, the target size criteria for response evaluation recommended in the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Brain Metastases.32 Additionally, this system assisted radiologists with various experience levels to improve their detection effectiveness, increasing the mean sensitivity by 21% and decreasing the mean reading time by 40%. Third, users should pay close attention to the lesions that were easy to be overlooked by BMD, especially for the small metastases with slight enhancement or non-enhancement (SupplementaryFigure 3B). Additionally, we found that the sensitivity of our network on validation set was weakly correlated with the lesion size (P = .023, odds ratio: 1.079, 95% CI: 1.010–1.151), but was not related to the number of lesions per patient (P = .984). Another feature that separates this study from previous works is the strength of using 16 types of scanners manufactured by four suppliers, diverse images from four institutions, and the largest number of participating centers and readers.

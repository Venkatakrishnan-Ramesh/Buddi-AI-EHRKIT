Research in contextEvidence before this studyLive-attenuated yellow fever vaccine YF17D is the basis for two licensed vaccines and other promising YF17D-based vaccine candidates, amongst others, Zika, HIV, Ebola, Lassa and malaria are under development. Cellular responses elicited by single YF-S0 vaccination in mice. e) Spot counts for IFNγ producing cells per 106 splenocytes after stimulation with MHC-I restricted YFV NS3 peptide. Ifnar−/− mice were vaccinated with 400 PFU of either YF-S0 or YF17D, while sham group received same volume medium (n=7, except for n=8 for YF-S0, from single experiment). Data were analysed by Kruskal–Wallis test (one-way ANOVA) followed by Dunn's multiple comparison (ns = Not-Significant, P > 0.05, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001).Figure 1Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of single-dose YF-S0 vaccination in mice. ( Dashed line represents lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). ( Lobular (h) (indicated by blue arrows) and portal (i) (indicated by red arrows) inflammation are graded from 0 to 3 (0, normal; 1, minimal; 2, moderate; 3, severe). m) Heat maps (generated with median) showing expression profile of selected cytokine genes in liver, spleen and kidney of sham, YF17D and YF-S0 vaccinated hamsters five days post hamster-adapted YFV-Asibi (scale represents fold-change over healthy controls). Three weeks after last immunization (day 21), mice were bled for serology and their spleens harvested for ELISpot (Figure 3a).Figure 3Impact of pre-existing YFV-specific immunity on immunogenicity of YF-S0 in mice. ( Control and sham group received same volume of medium. RT-qPCR for lung homogenates was performed exactly as described in detail before.18,26,30 For YFV viral RNA level qualification, RT-qPCR was performed using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) by using primers and probe derived from YFV non-structural gene 3 (Supplementary Table 3). Also, single YF-S0 resulted, like YF17D vaccination, in an almost complete normalization of cytokine expression profiles serving as a sensitive marker of viscerotropic and neurotropic YFV disease; especially in the liver, regarding IP-10 (as a marker for liver disease initiation and progression), CXCL9 (liver damage) and IFNγ (Figure 1k; S1h).32,33 Similarly, IP-10 and IFNγ showed normal expression in the spleens and brains of YF-S0 and YF17D vaccinated mice equaling healthy controls; hence markedly lower than in sham-immunized mice (Figure 1k; S1h). b. mean ± 95% CI value of spot counts for IFNγ-producing cells per 106 splenocytes after stimulation with either YFV NS4B peptide (in Figure 3e) or spike peptide pool (in Figure 3f). Some (non-significant) reduction in CMI (Figure 3f) observed in mice is consistent with the relatively higher impact of pre-existing anti-vector immunity on subsequent cellular immunity, further depending on the animal model used.37,53,61 Importantly, we clearly demonstrate that pre-existing YFV-specific immunity does not lead to a reduction in the efficacy of YF-S0 to protect against SARS-CoV-2 B1.1.7 variant in hamsters (Figure 4e; S4e), neither after a single- nor two-dose vaccination.

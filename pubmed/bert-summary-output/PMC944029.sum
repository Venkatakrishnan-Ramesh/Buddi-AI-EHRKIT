Glioma is the most common malignancy in the CNS, accounting for approximately 30% and 80% of all major nervous tumor cases and brain tumor cases, respectively (Siegel et al., In the current study, we revealed that GINS1 was significantly upregulated in glioma cells and tissues. High expression of GINS1 predicted an advanced clinical grade and a poor survival. The patients were clinically grade characterized (patient #1: Grade III; patient #2: Grade II; patient #3: Grade I; patient #4: Grade IV). Bar graph data are presented as the mean ± SD; ∗, p < 0.05.(F) Western blot analysis of GINS1 expression in glioma specimens of low clinical grades and high clinical grades. Bar graph data are presented as the mean ± SD; ∗, p < 0.05. (G) IHC staining analysis of GINS1 protein expression in normal brain tissues and glioma tissues of different clinical stages. Additionally, GINS1 silencing decreased the expression levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl but enhanced the proapoptotic protein BAX in U251 and T98G cells (Figures 3O and 3P). Furthermore, we found that GINS1 silencing has no influence on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of the normal glial cell HEB (Figures S3A–S3I). Experiments were conducted independently thrice. Experiments were performed independently thrice. Representative pictures are shown on the left, and the statistical data are counted on the right. Representative profiles are shown on the left, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was statistically analyzed on the right. Experiments were conducted in triplicate. Scale bars, 100 μm (200×magnification) for all panels. (I and J) The invasion and migration capacities of glioma cells were evaluated with transwell assays (I) and wound healing assays (J) in GINS1-silenced T98G and GINS1-silenced U251 cells. To further explore the biological role of overexpressed GINS1 in glioma, the glioma cell line A172 with GINS1 overexpression was established (Figures 4E and 4F). (F) Kaplan–Meier survival curves show progression-free survival of high TOP2A-expressing (n = 331) and low TOP2A-expressing (n = 331) patients with glioma from the TCGA database. Although some significant discoveries were presented in this study, there are several limitations that must be mentioned. Patients received no systemic treatment before the surgery. Then, the cells were incubated with 50 μL MTT solution for 3 h. At 490 nM, the absorbance value of each well was measured by a microplate reader. Protein samples (20 μL) were boiled in LDS buffer for Western blotting, and 80 μL protein samples were analyzed by label-free LC/MS. Protein bands were detected with specific antibodies by Western blotting.

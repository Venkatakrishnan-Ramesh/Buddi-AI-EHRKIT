Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age, affecting 8% to 13% of all women worldwide and 15% to 20% of women seeking pregnancy.1–4 In the United States alone, it is estimated that PCOS affects approximately 5 million women of reproductive age, resulting in almost $4 billion yearly in direct medical costs.5Much of the existing literature on PCOS has focused primarily on reproductive effects. New mothers are contacted via mailed questionnaire (available in English and Spanish) multiple times and telephone follow-up. with “yes,” “no,” or “I do not know” response options (clinically diagnosed PCOS), (2) “Have you ever experienced any of the following health problems?”—with the following choices—“irregular periods (menstruation)”; “skin condition that causes pimples (acne)”; “increased hair growth on the face, chest, or other parts of the body (hirsutism)”; and “being overweight or obese” with “yes” or “no” response options (symptom-based PCOS). A secondary analysis defined PCOS symptomology as having all 3 symptoms: irregular periods, acne, and hirsutism.17,18 The reference group was women with regular menstruation. Another strength included the large representative sample of women from across the United States, purposively sampled to include women at greatest risk of pregnancy-related health problems,15,16 increasing generalizability.

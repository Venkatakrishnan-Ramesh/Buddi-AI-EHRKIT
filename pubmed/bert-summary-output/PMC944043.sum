in sharp contrast to the intricate and destructive separation and extraction of NSC, increasing researches have revealed the potential of MSC and MSC-derived exosomes in SCI therapy [36,37]. Nevertheless, two high hurdles remain to overcome: 1) there exists limited knowledge about which kind of MSC exosomes is the best choice for SCI repair, and 2) exosomes therapeutics entails the use of time-consuming and laborious extraction process. 2Spinor-derived exosomes possessed optimized properties both in quantity and quality.

S4G), both of whose suppressions were in favor of the nerve regeneration after spinal cord injury [46,47]. Collectively, these results related to exosomes fully testified to the optimized Spinor-derived exosomes, both in quantity and quality, as a potential tool to repair the injured spinal cord. The data were presented as the means ​± ​s.d. ( To assess the neuro-regenerative potential of Spinor, 18 rats with complete SCI were divided into three groups: 1) PBS treatment (Ctrl), 2) Spinor treatment and 3) DPMSC treatment, and 6 healthy rats subjected to mock surgery that just included myelotomy and suture without spinal cord transaction were used as positive control. Meanwhile, with measuring the electric potential difference from motor cortex to the sciatic nerve of rats, high-amplitude motor-evoked potentials (MEP) can be found in Spinor-treated and healthy groups in sharp contrast to the baseline noise signals measured in mock- and MSC- treated groups (Fig. n ​= ​6/group) p values were calculated by ANOVA. B) To quantify glycolysis, relative intensity of [18F]FDG signal was quantified and normalized the sum of the vertebral ROIs percent injected dose per gram of tissue over the total amount of radioactivity in the whole body of the rat, excluding the amount trapped in the tail. of each experiment performed in triplicate.

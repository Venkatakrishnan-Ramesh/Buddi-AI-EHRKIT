Some patients complain of difficulty eating without hand support because of cervical instability. At the elongated cervical interspinous space, Doppler echography revealed angiogenesis in all cases, and it was confirmed by pathological findings in 1 case (case 2). Initial MRI findings showed high signal intensity in cervical extensor tissue in 7 of 8 cases, and follow-up MRI showed decreased signal intensity in 3 of the 7 cases. Early intervention (physiotherapy, orthosis) can prevent recurrent hyperelongation of the extensor muscles. Analysis and interpretation of data: Endo, Sawaji, Suzuki, Konishi.

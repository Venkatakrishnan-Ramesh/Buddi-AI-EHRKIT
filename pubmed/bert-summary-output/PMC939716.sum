The willingness to pay for the coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine was about US$71 for a vaccine with 90% effectiveness, a risk of severe complications for 1 person per 1 million people, imported vaccine, and 24-month duration of protection attributes. Therefore, identifying the determinants associated with the WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine is essential for the government and other organizations to design an excellent intervention to be used in key populations [6–9]. Studies have evaluated the acceptance and the WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine globally but in Iran such evidence is limited [10, 11].Another issue after vaccine acceptance by individuals is that when the COVID-19 vaccine becomes available there will not be enough supply to vaccinate the entire population. In the assessment of the respondent’s perception of the choice sets, in other words, the questionnaire’s internal validity, the dominant choice set was entered into the vaccine choice sets as a test of rationality in the questionnaire, in which one scenario was logically and superior to the opposite scenario. First, an online survey may create a selection bias. Third, as a tool to measure the preferences, the DCE cannot include too many attributes and levels, which makes it different from the real situation. Based on studies, between four and six attributes are acceptable and no more than eight attributes should be specified [30, 31].Generally, the WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine in Iran was higher than the cost of the vaccine (the cost of the vaccine in Iran was from US$4 to US$14.5 per dose [32]); however, the WTP varied depending on the vaccine attributes.

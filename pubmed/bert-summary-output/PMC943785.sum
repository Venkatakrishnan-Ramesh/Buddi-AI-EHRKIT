Bees have been important pollinators ever since the Cretaceous (Genise et al., 2010)—making their identification and conservation urgent concerns. Its common name, the common drone fly, stems from the resemblance of members of this genus to the drones of honey bees (Figure 1).Figure 1Citizen scientist photos of bees and bee mimic flies(A) Bumble bee mimic (Asilidae: Laphria thoracica) preying on bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Bombus spp.), a putative example of aggressive mimicry. This AI model was trained, validated, and tested on 3,029 bee and 2,943 non-bee insect images. t-SNE is an AI technique for dimensionality reduction, particularly well-suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets (Hinton and Roweis 2002)). For this, 683 bee and 539 non-bee color images were used, which were evenly distributed across all the species. All testing results are for unseen images only. The third row presents the accuracy of a dataset comprising unseen images from those species of bumble bees and non-bumble bees used in training and validation. More details on the species used in testing are included in Tables S4 and S5. First, we can see that the ResNet-101 architecture achieved good accuracy in classifying bumble bees from non-bumble bees, with the best testing accuracies exhibited by the model trained with color and grayscale images (>88%; average for testing, row 5). 2016) to pinpoint which pixels in an image were most used to make a classification by the AI. If the pixels highlighted in the CAM appear on anatomical components of the insect, that means that the model learned to classify correctly, while ignoring the background. From Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for all AI models and image classes, we see that our models focused primarily on the anatomical components of the insect (for both color and grayscale images), and have learned well enough to ignore the background. Species and classifications, from left: Andrena cineraria (correct), Apis dorsata (correct), Megachile mendica (correct).Figure 4Bumble beesCitizen science photos (top) and class activation maps (bottom) of bumble bees using the bee vs. non-bee classifier (VGG16-based model, trained with color images). Phylogeny may play a non-mutually exclusive role within Tachinidae as well, as the wasp mimics and non-mimics are sister groups (Figure 7), and have more similar accuracies compared to those of the bee mimics (based on both models; Tables 5 and 8). The latter demonstrates that the algorithm was able to better detect these mimics as non-bumble bees on the basis of color. We did monitor, but did not explicitly record decrease in the loss function; we stopped training when the loss function (and accuracy) saturated.

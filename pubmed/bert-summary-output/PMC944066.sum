Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are commonly prescribed medications to treat various medical conditions, including hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, vasospasm, and migraine headaches.1,2 The widespread use of CCBs has contributed to the increase in intentional and accidental overdoses that are linked to lethal consequences as a result of cardiovascular collapse.3 The lack of standardized guidelines to manage CCB toxicity and the unfamiliarity of CCB toxicity management among health care providers, cases of CCB toxicity can go unrecognized. CCB toxicity can be suspected if the amount of CCB ingested exceeds the maximum therapeutic dose. Induction agents can change the positive ventilation and exacerbate the hemodynamic stability of the patient due to loss of sympathetic tone. For intubated patients, dilution in 0.25 water: 1 activated charcoal is warranted with the use of a large bore nasogastric (NG) tube (eg, 10â€“14 French gauge). No specific vasopressor is superior to another, and the selection of the agent should be guided by the type of shock observed in the patient. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an invasive hemodynamic rescue therapy that provides temporary mechanical support for circulation and gas exchange.32 Despite the high risk of complications of ECMO, when used for cardiogenic shock and where all other modalities have failed, the benefits of ECMO outweigh its risk.9,32 This approach is best reserved as a last-line modality in CCB toxicity.72,73CCB toxicity is a commonly encountered medical emergency that requires vigilant initial patient evaluation and assessment.

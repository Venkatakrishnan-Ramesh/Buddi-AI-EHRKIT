Medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction is a well-established operative procedure that can be performed alone or in conjunction with bony procedures in patients with recurrent episodes of lateral patellar instability.1 Accurate anatomic insertion positioning, especially for the location of the tunnel in the medial condyle of the femur, is critical to the success of this operation. D) A true-lateral fluoroscopy of the knee joint is performed to confirm that the spherical heads of the 3 ear studs are located at the insertion point (red arrows). The shape of the ear stud can meet the requirements and be purchased in stores or online.

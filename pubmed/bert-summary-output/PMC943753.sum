Furthermore, excellent postoperative external rotation and abduction, and—in conjunction with correcting for bony erosion—allow for correction of posterior humeral-head subluxation.7,20 While these same benefits may be achievable with thorough capsular releases from both the glenoid and humeral sides—also known as a capsulotomy—some shoulder surgeons, including the authors (G.R.W. and G.E.G.) resect the entire anteroinferior capsule—a capsulectomy—with every primary anatomic TSA for glenohumeral arthritis. Next, the capsule is released from the humerus using electrocautery, with blunt retractors placed to protect the axillary nerve. A) A plane is developed between the subscapularis and anterior capsule. ( A Fukuda retractor is placed posterior to the glenoid to retract the humeral head posterolaterally, and 2 blunt Hohman retractors are placed in the plane previously developed between the capsule and the subscapularis, deep to the axillary nerve, while a Kocher clamp is used to securely grasp the capsule (Fig 5A). B, C) A square-shaped section of the anteroinferior capsule is then resected using electrocautery. ( The repair is assessed for security, full range of motion, and soft-tissue balance of the prosthesis is confirmed (Fig 6C).Fig 6Lesser tuberosity osteotomy (LTO) repair of the right shoulder after placement of the prosthesis.

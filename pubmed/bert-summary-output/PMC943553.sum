Recipients of solid organ transplants take life-long immunosuppressive agents to prevent rejection. In addition, withdrawal of standard immunosuppression may result in organ rejection. Only 14 (2.8%) patients had received treatment for organ rejection in the 3 months before the COVID-19 diagnosis. They also had significantly higher rates of ICU admission and ventilator requirement, and had the highest all-cause mortality rate within 90 days of COVID-19 diagnosis (Figure 2). In contrast to Heldman and colleagues,16 we did not find any significant improvements over time in disease severity outcomes, including ICU admission and death.16 The lack of change in our cohort may be owing to the longer study time period, the advent of more severe variants of SARS-CoV-2 in 2021 and the availability of therapeutics across all studied time periods. Despite therapeutic advances, disease severity did not appear to change over time and recipients of lung transplants appear the most vulnerable.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable and fatal tumor among adults, which originates from the central nervous system (CNS). GBM is the most common primary malignant brain tumor with an incidence rate of 3.20 per 100,000 population in the USA [1]. Current standard treatment for newly diagnosed GBM comprises surgical resection, adjuvant radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy [2]. Despite these aggressive strategies, radio-resistance leads to tumor recurrence in most patients and results in a median overall survival (OS) of only 12–15 months after diagnosis [2,3]. Thus, it is imperative to investigate the underlying mechanism of tumor recurrence after irradiation to improve patient prognosis. The GBM diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. The cell lysates were normalized by their protein content. Activated T cells were co-cultured with GBM-derived exosomes, with or without irradiation, for 48 h. The supernatant was exosome-depleted and was applied to a Proteome Profiler™ Human Cytokine Array Kit (ARY005B, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Cell proliferation was measured using CFSE staining. B) Quantitative summary of the cytokine array analysis in (A) (n = 3). ( The protein levels of T-bet and Foxp3 were determined using western blotting. ( 2Irradiated glioblastoma (GBM) cells decrease Th1 and increase Treg cells in vivo. ( B) Activated T cell markers CD69 and CD25 were tested using flow cytometry before they were injected into mice. ( C–D) The T cell subsets in blood, spleens, and tumors from mice were measured using flow cytometry. B) Protein concentration from equal numbers of cell was measured. ( E) Density gradient centrifugation confirming that B7–H4 secreted by irradiated GBM cells co-fractionated with exosome markers CD63, ALIX, and TSG101. ( G) The intracellular localization of B7–H4 was examined using flow cytometry (n = 6). ( C–D) Naïve T cells were activated and cultured in Th1 differentiation medium for 72 h with exosomes from GBM cells expressing exogenous B7–H4 or vector. ( The apical kinase, ATM, orchestrates the cellular responses to DNA damage produced by irradiation [19]. To deternmine the involvement of ATM in exosome production, ATM-related genes from 153 GBM samples in the TCGA dataset were analyzed. Furthermore, to identify the significantly enriched pathways in the DEGs identified, KEGG pathway analysis was performed. C) Endogenous ATM and STAT3 interact with each other in LN229 (upper panel) and LN308 (lower panel) cell lines. A) The position of the most representative putative binding sites of the promoter associated with STAT3 motifs predicted by JASPAR (http://jaspar.genereg.net). ( F) The levels of STAT1, FoxP3, and T-bet in Th1 cells was measured using Western blot. ( STAT1 overexpression reverted the immune response inhibited by exosomes from B7–H4 overexpressing cells or irradiated GBM cells, as indicated by the increased number of Th1 cells and T-bet protein levels (Fig. Taken together, these results indicate that exosomal B7–H4 decreases GBM cell sensitivity to irradiation, and reduces murine survival in the GL261 model. C) Histograms showing the mean tumor weights for each group. ( K) C57BL/6 mice were intracranially implanted with GL261 cells with exogenous B7–H4 or control vector.

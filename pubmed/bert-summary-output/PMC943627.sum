Before admission, the patient was not on a proton pump inhibitor and did not have factors that predisposed her to developing gastric ulcers. S. ventriculi demonstrates distinctive histopathologic features: cuboid organisms that occur in tetrads or packets of 8 as a result of cell division in 2 planes of growth, with basophilic staining with hematoxylin-eosin.4 Histopathologic identification in this case indicated basophilic staining organisms arranged in tetrads with surrounding necroinflammatory debris consistent with a diagnosis of S. ventriculi (Figure 1).

As the prototypic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) senses extracellular growth signals and transduces the signal inside the cell to regulate various important cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and survival (1). EGFR expression levels and signaling strength are tightly controlled in cells. Consequently, HGS O-GlcNAcylation inhibits intraluminal sorting and lysosomal degradation of EGFR, leading to the accumulation of EGFR at the early endosome and prolonged EGFR signaling in cells. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of n = 3 independent experiments. To clarify the steps in which HGS O-GlcNAcylation regulates EGFR degradation, we first analyzed the internalization of EGFR upon EGF stimulation by quantifying the uptake of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled EGF into stable SK cells. A two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test was used for statistical analysis. ** G) EGFR recycling in stable SK cells expressing WT or 3SA HGS as measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The internalized EGFR was targeted to the early endosome (25, 26). The blots are presentative of three biological replicates. Increasing O-GlcNAcylation by the treatment with TMG (30) decreased the amount of STAM being pulled down in cells expressing WT HGS, but had no effect in cells expressing 3SA HGS (Fig. C) Ki67 staining of tumors generated from SK cells expressing WT or 3SA HGS. We used HepG2-R cells as the parental cell lines to generate stable cells expressing Flag-tagged WT or 3SA HGS with a simultaneous depletion of the endogenous HGS (SI Appendix, Fig. Previous studies have shown that increasing HGS ubiquitination blocks the ILV sorting of EGFR by inhibiting the interaction between HGS and EGFR (25, 32).

Stroke can be defined as the “rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, lasting more than 24 hours or leading to death, with no apparent cause other than that of vascular origin” [2]. It is the second-leading cause of death and the third-leading cause of death and disability combined [3]. Rehabilitation is an essential aspect of the continuum of care of people with stroke. When comparing the results of studies with larger versus smaller difference in minutes of rehabilitation per week, no difference was reported in terms of ADL (P = 0.44), activity measures of the upper limb (P = 0.14), activity measures of the lower limb (P = 0.64), and motor impairment measures of the upper limb (P = 0.22).

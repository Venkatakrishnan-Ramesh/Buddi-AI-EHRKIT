Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic with over 160 million confirmed cases worldwide and total deaths officially exceeding 3.3 million[1] as of May 2021, with United States of America and India having the greatest number of COVID-19-related deaths. Several tests have been attempted to stratify the risks in COVID-19 infection. From a total of 906 patients admitted to the ICU for severe COVID-19 infection, we used the arbitrary cutoffs of hemoglobin (Hb) values on admission as per the WHO guidelines where normal hemoglobin concentration in males and females is defined as >13 g/dl and >12 g/dl, respectively. Overall results of the analysis (n = 784) suggest a significant correlation of anemia with the severity of COVID-19, that is death in the study population (P = 0.000204). Therefore, people who are anemic may be suffering from inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues, regardless of adequate PaO2 and SpO2 values.

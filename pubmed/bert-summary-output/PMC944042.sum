Itaconic acid is a five-carbon dicarboxylic acid that has been recognized as a platform chemical with broad applications in the production of commodity and specialty chemicals such as polymers, coatings and solvents (W et al., 2019) and the need to maintain phosphate (Willke and Vorlop, 2001) and manganese (Karaffa et al., 2019) which are capable of producing itaconic acid from purified hexose and pentose sugars characteristic of the sugars present in lignocellulosic feedstocks at pH well below the pKa of itaconic acid (pKa = 3.58) allowing for production of the free acid (Bafana and Pandey, 2018). For visualization purposes the aligned reads were examined in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (Robinson et al., C) Correlation between itaconic acid production and final biomass or other acids. GX (glucose/xylose medium), P (phosphate), N (yeast extract). Activated pathways tend to be involved in utilization of alternative carbon sources (Table 3) while the most significantly up-regulated individual metabolic genes are involved in terreic acid biosynthesis (513675, 172x; 283888, 27x) and itaconic acid biosynthesis (531880, 92x; 505023, 50x; 497765, 33x; 466479, 15x).Table 2Gene ontology term enrichment in LaeA overexpression strain transcriptome. Genes involved in secondary metabolism are not well annotated in the metabolic model. It is interesting to note that the transcription factor in the terreic acid cluster (atF) is not significantly altered in expression level, while the biosynthetic genes (atA, atC, atD, atE, and atX) and the transporter (atB) are all significantly up-regulated from 27- to 250-fold (Fig. 3Regulation of secondary metabolite clusters by LaeA. The expression level of predicted secondary metabolite clusters was determined in wild-type and LaeA overexpression strains during growth stage in shake flasks. Transcriptome sequencing depth is shown in log scale. ( Significantly up- and down-regulated proteins in the LaeA overexpression strain versus wild-type during growth (36h) and the transition to production phase (60h and 84h) were assessed for enrichment of gene ontology terms. Dashes indicate genes that were not detected at the transcript or protein level or for which insufficient data was available for statistical analysis.

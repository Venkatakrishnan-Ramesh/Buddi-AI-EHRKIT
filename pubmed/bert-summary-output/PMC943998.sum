Given the potential infant exposure to antidepressants via excretion into breast milk, this study evaluated the concentrations of allopregnanolone in breast milk and maternal plasma from the start of a 60-h infusion of brexanolone injection through 7 days in 12 healthy volunteers. 2Allopregnanolone concentration in breast milk for each participant. Breast milk concentration data are presented for individual participants, as pumping was ad libitum. Figure 4a, b show the simulated concentration of plasma allopregnanolone vs time in the BRX60 and BRX90 infusion groups, respectively. a, b Includes 1000 simulated individual profiles. The final PopPK model in patients with PPD was used to simulate 1000 profiles for the c 60 µg/kg/h and d 90 µg/kg/h regimens. First, the lipid content of breast milk may be an important consideration; concentrations of lipophilic antidepressants vary considerably between foremilk and hindmilk, with their penetration ratios being higher in hindmilk than in foremilk [36]. Second, the current study did not evaluate penetration ratios of brexanolone into breast milk.

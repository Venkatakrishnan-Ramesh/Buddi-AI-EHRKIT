Since December 2019, Wuhan, China, has experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1 Although the outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market, that also traded live wild animals, it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person transmission was also occurring.2 In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic. In the current study, only primary care data is available for us and patients with severe illness presented directly to secondary care for prognosis and further treatment. During our data collection period, the case fatality rate was 3.2% in the US, 7.5% in Canada, 15% in the UK, whereas in Qatar and Kuwait it was only 0.16% and 0.67%, respectively (as of August 10, 2020).17 It has been assumed that population demographics and comorbidity burden are the key determinants of variability in case fatality rates. These results contradict the previous studies published in Qatar and UK.12,15,21With respect to the association between comorbidities and hospital admission and complications, it was found that CVD patients with kidney disease have a higher risk of hospital admission as compared with other patients.

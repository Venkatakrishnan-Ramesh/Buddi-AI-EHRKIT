Integrins are a large family of α/β heterodimeric metalloreceptors that are unique to metazoans. αXβ2 and its ligand-binding domain, the αX I-domain, exhibit distinct affinity and structural changes in solution and cell surfaces, and thus, serve in our study as a receptor in characterizing the effects of dications in integrin affinity maturation and allostery establishment. In short, reduced breathing motion or minimal interaction frustration conferred by Mg2+ binding is accompanied by an increase in the structural stability of the αX I-domain scaffold, suggesting that the Mg2+-MIDAS assembly is thermodynamically more stable, and thus, has established an allostery among structural elements of the αX I-domain. The three-dimensional (3D) plot of P(r) versus particle radius r(Å) in varying Mg2+ concentrations (Figure 5B) revealed a stepwise evolution of effective radius (Dmax) and radius of gyration (Rg) of the αX I-domain, extending its Dmax from 50 to 78 Å and Rg from 18.2 Å to 29.5 Å (Table S2). Here, the affinity of the minor population is similar to the affinity of the I314G. Increasing Mg2+ concentration progressively shifted the center of the Kd peak toward a high-affinity state (Figures 6A–6E; Table S3) while reducing the heterogeneity of the major conformational ensemble on the Kd/Koff matrix as shown by reduced dispersity of the 2D-binding sensorgram (Figures 6A–6E and S6A). Next, we used TS1/18 and XVA143 to block β2-ί MIDAS activation; any affinity change then becomes independent of the β2 I-domain and only stays dependent on the αX I-domain affinity maturation. In fact, the observed Ca2+-MIDAS assemblies in integrins display loose tethering, which is highlighted by heterogenic or polygonal (hexa- or hepta-) coordination in the complex formation of the αI-domain with a ligand mimetic antibody (mAb107) and also in other proteins (Mahalingam et al., It is, thus, tempting to speculate that the 160-fold (12,000/75)—not the 3-fold—affinity increase observed between Ala and Gly mutants stems from the difference in the considerable side-chain hydrophobicity index (ΔtR) of 41 between Ala and Gly, creating this large affinity gap (Monera et al., pH at the extracellular space, ~7.4, supports the external ligand binding. 2021; Sen and Springer, 2016; Sen et al., The global flexibility of the αI-domain fold, relative to the remainder of the integrin, appears to be a natural consequence of the intrinsic dynamics within the αI-domain scaffold probed here.

The recombinant protein was eluted in elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM reduced glutathione, 10% glycerol, pH 8) and digested with human rhinovirus 3C Protease at a ratio of 1:20 protease:protein for 16 hours at 4°C for complete digestion. The systems were prepared with CHARMM-GUI’s Glycan Reader and Modeller tool with all crystal waters surrounding the αX I-domain included for system preparation using the CHARMM36m (charmm36-mar2019.ff) forcefield (Jo et al., PROPKA-calculated pKa values were assigned as the inherent pKa values and remained constant for the duration of the entire simulation. Each Mg2+/αX I-domain dataset displayed characteristics of a compact globular scattering biomolecule in solution. E-IgM-iC3b (250uL) was then added and the plate was incubated for 1.5 hrs at 37°C. Rosettes (>10 erythrocytes/HEK293T cell) were scored by microscopy.

The biomedical text mining community has recognized that there is a strong need for text mining in the drug development pipeline and for pharmacovigilance (PV) in particular. For decades, individual case safety reports (ICSRs) housed in various drug manufacturer safety databases and in surveillance systems such as the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) EudraVigilance and the World Health Organization’s VigiBase have been the main sources of post-marketing ADR information (9, 10). A barrier to the evaluation of safety issues in the ARIA system is the ability to identify the health outcomes of interest (HOI) with an acceptable positive predictive value (21, 22). ADEs (46) are among the information documented in the narratives. However, they contain few instances of ADEs. As a result, data set creation efforts may combine these approaches, so that they can balance out the need for identifying a good, representative data set with the biases and labor that come with each approach. In particular, ADEs and reasons for medication administration are ambiguous and can be confused with each other, since both are medical problems and differ from each other only in the way they relate to the drug. Unsurprisingly, most of the system errors on ADE extraction result from incorrect disambiguation from reasons for medication administration. These problems greatly reduce the value of SRS data for many PV goals, such as identifying events in patients with characteristics not encoded in discrete fields, e.g. pregnancy, or evaluating rates and sources of intolerability that lead to non-adherence and non-persistence, which are major clinical and public health problems that increase healthcare costs (67).

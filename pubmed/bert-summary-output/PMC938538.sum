Amidst recent rapid expansion of glaucoma surgical options, and with a focus on minimally invasive approaches, goniotomy for adult eyes with glaucoma has reemerged as a viable option. Excisional goniotomy using the Kahook Dual Blade (KDB, New World Medical, Rancho Cucamonga, CA) is one of several innovative glaucoma procedures developed in recent years to satisfy unmet needs in the surgical glaucoma arena for a safer surgical option. In the randomized trial, 164 eyes with mild to moderate open-angle glaucoma (OAG) were randomized to one of the two treatments.32 The study's primary endpoint was IOP reduction ≥20% or IOP reduction ≥1 medication at 12 months and was achieved by 94% of excisional goniotomy eyes and 83% of micro bypass eyes (p = 0.04). Transient bleeding from the TM excision site is common, expected, and typical of most angle-based surgeries.

New developments in regenerative medicine with the use of mobilized or in vitro-modified stem cells have generated new avenues and opportunities for the treatment of many debilitative diseases, including chronic skin wounds.1 However, efforts towards cell-based therapies and their application in hospitals are costly and time-consuming. For the study of monocytes/macrophages infiltration, a wound was induced using a sterile punch needle (5 mm in diameter) on the left hindlimbs of isoflurane-anesthetized CX3CR1-GFP mice (on C57BL/6J background, Jackson Laboratories).24 Treatment with COAM (100 µL with a concentration of 2 mg/mL, 200 µg dose) was injected intra-dermally at four different locations in the dermis around the wound edge. C) Bacteria colonization determined in skin wounds infected with S. aureus (green bars) and MRSA (red bars), 2 days after infection. For each strain, a control group (saline) and COAM group was included. As a comparison, we added the reference values to the known COAM effect in the air pouch model19 (Panel C, horizontal striped line) and we concluded that COAM has no additive nor inhibitory effect on the maximal neutrophil changes at 24 hours (short-term) post-wounding. Although no significant differences in sizes or percentages of wound healing were detected at later time points of the healing process, it was evident that the wounds in COAM-treated mice healed faster at an earlier time point (Figure 6C).Figure 5Effect of COAM on monocyte/macrophage infiltration into mouse skin wounds. ( The higher intensity in the wound of COAM-treated mouse corresponds to more macrophage recruitment. Figure 6Wound repair in response to COAM treatment. C) Kaplan-Meier analysis illustrating at which time point the wounds healed. With all combined characteristics, COAM creates strong chemotaxis in vivo into mouse skin with intact epithelial and dermal layers.19In the present study, no changes were observed in neutrophil numbers after supplementation of COAM to the open wounds, in comparison with the vehicle. Indeed, COAM amplified the endogenous signals evoked by wound induction, thus significantly recruiting more CX3CR1 monocytes/macrophages to the wounds compared to what was observed in control mice.

This is particularly relevant to tumors located at the nasopharynx, where multiple organs (including salivary glands, optic nerves and chiasm, cochlea, brainstem, and temporal lobes) that are sensitive to radiation are located nearby. 2019; United States) [13]Intervention: 61Control: 12T1: 10T2: 10T3: 15T4: 38N/AAJCC 7th ed.:Intervention and control:I: 2II: 7III: 21IV: 43All patients:14–78(51)Primary NPCN/A(90)N/A(2 Gy)(35)GTV: 70–76 Gy(70 Gy)Double-scattered PBTIMRT1. Survival outcomes: a. OS (3 years) b. PFS (3 years) c. LC (3 years)2. Moreover, thirteen studies used PBT as the intervention [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [29], [31], [34], [35], [36], while 6 studies treated patients with CIBT [20], [21], [23], [24], [25], [30]. The other 6 studies used a mixed beam approach, combining photon plus PBT or CIBT [11], [22], [26], [27], [28], [33]. The remaining one grouped patients using either photon alone or PBT alone in its investigation [32]. Hence, PBT was the most common intervention for NPC patients in this systematic review (Table 1). RTOG toxicity grading was used in 1 study [35], while 1 did not report the grading system [16].The pooled 1-year OS was 96 % (95 % CI = 92 %-98 %) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 2 %) among 287 primary NPC patients receiving PBT or CIBT in 6 studies [17], [19], [22], [26], [27], [34] (Fig. The subgroup analyses showed that there was no significant difference between patients receiving PBT and a mixed beam approach in the pooled 2-year OS (p = 0.92) and 3-year OS (p = 0.18) (Supplementary Fig. of studiesTotal patientsMedian follow-up range (Median) (months)No. (%) showed that 93 % of the patients were node-positive; the median of the mean dose to the left and right parotid was 45.76 GyE and 28.86 GyE, respectively [35]. A high parotid dose was also observed by Uezono et al. analysed the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and control treatment [28]. Findings from a systematic review suggested that PBT might offer better cost-effectiveness among head and neck cancer patients who were highly vulnerable to acute mucosal toxicities [44]. Given the limited study on the cost-effectiveness of particle beam therapy for NPC, future research is eagerly awaited in this aspect. We also conducted subgroup analyses on the primary outcome by stratifying studies based on different types of radiotherapy to explore the heterogeneous meta-analysis results (i.e., the pooled 2-year and 3-year OS rate with I2 > 50 %). More clinical trials in this aspect are needed, and network meta-analyses might be helpful to investigate the comparative effectiveness of different RT modalities for the treatment of NPC in the future. Approximately 5 % mortality rate was reported among locally recurrent NPC patients. However, future randomized controlled trials will be needed to compare the long-term effectiveness of PBT or CIBT with photon-based IMRT for NPC.

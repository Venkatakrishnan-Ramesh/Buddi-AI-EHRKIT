A novel coronavirus was reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China (Nishiura et al. Thus, high risk populations (e.g., the elderly) can stay away from those places in SC.Which neighborhoods and POI categories have high COVID-19 incidence rates? For example, if βbase does not change with t, rβ = 0; if βbase increases with t, rβ > 0, and vice versa. Equation (6) and (7) were used to compute the RMSE of the daily case. However, spatial patterns of the transmission rate within each county are also revealed as that some CBGs have higher or low transmission rates than their neighbors. Averagely, a CBG had 88 COVID-19 infections in the study period. Figure 10 shows the POIs with more than 30 infections that occurred in the MSAs. Per capita visit count to POIs had a positive correlation in Columbia (r = 0.425, p < 0.001) and Charleston (r = 0.174, p < 0.001), but not in Greenville. A dearth of studies has applied such datasets to small MSAs. The simulation results reveal distinct patterns of COVID-19 transmission among the three MSAs in the second wave, suggesting that disease control measures tailored to different geographic locations need to be carefully developed by local authorities. First, the neighborhood- and POI-level simulation provides detailed spatial information on transmission rates and infection counts. This study used fine-grained smartphone mobility data to simulate the COVID-19 spreading in the three MSAs of SC to obtain the transmission rates and infection counts at neighborhood- and POI-level. The aggregated confirmed cases in the simulation match the COVID-19 historical case trend at the MSA-level with low errors in three metrics: total cases, daily case RMSE, and the White and Black race cases, indicating that the simulating model can be used in relatively small MSAs which were under-investigated in the literature.

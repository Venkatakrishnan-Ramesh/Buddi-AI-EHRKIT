Insulin glargine 300 Units/mL (Gla-300, Toujeo®) provides sustained glycaemic control over 24 h and allows a flexible dosing schedule. Gla-300 and Gla-100 are not bioequivalent or interchangeable; when switching from Gla-100, in order to achieve target ranges for plasma glucose levels, the dose of Gla-300 may be increased by 10–18% [22]. This evidence highlights the importance of PK and PD studies of clinical individual doses under conditions mimicking as close as possible real-world conditions in which patients are treated with different doses of basal insulins. The proportion of patients with severe and/or confirmed nocturnal hypoglycaemia was similar between groups, with the exception of the first 8 weeks of the study, when they were lower with Gla-300 (rate ratio 0.69 [95% CI 0.53–0.91]) [38].The 6-month, multicentre, open-label, Phase 3 study Edition-JP-1, carried out on Japanese adults with T1DM under basal-bolus regime, found similar results.

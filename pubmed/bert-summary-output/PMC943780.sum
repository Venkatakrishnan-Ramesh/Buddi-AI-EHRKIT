Karst simulation models cover a wide range of application areas and can be used for “global” analysis. The CFP model enables the karst conduit to exchange water through porous media and can better characterize the non-Darcy flow characteristics of conduit media in karst areas (Qin and Jiang, 2014; Giese et al., And ammonium molybdate is suitable for long distance tracer test. Figure 3Distribution map of various points in the simulation area. ( According to the observed water levels from January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2019 (Figure 9), there is a good correlation between the S1 Well groundwater level and the Baotu Spring water level, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.69. a) S1 Well; (b) S2 Well; (c) S3 Well; (d) S10 Well. 1-spring group; 2-geological hole; 3-split grid; 4-isoline of groundwater level/m; 5-conduit). Subsequently, the CFP program was re-run to obtain the corresponding spring water level simulation value, and then calculated the RMSE (after adjusting the parameter value). Specifically, the karst conduit diameter in the CFP model is quite small; therefore, the adjustment range of ±10% and ±20% had little effect on the numerical value.

Analysis of aquifer connectivity and water conductivity: Using the CuiMa tracer test in 1989, the Xikema tracer test in 1996, the Laopo-Baiyungang tracer test and the Longdong tracer test, it was proven that the groundwater of the Zhangxia Formation is closely connected to the groundwater of the Ordovician system. This study confirmed a karst conduit along S1 Well—S4 Well—S10 Well—Baotu Spring at the plane position. By replenishing the source, it increases the amount of groundwater that can be exploited, and also ensures the continuous flow of spring water, thereby protecting the spring and supplying water demands.

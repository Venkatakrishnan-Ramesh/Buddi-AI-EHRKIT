Human mobility restrictions have shown to be effective in mitigating the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission (1–2). To identify the factors that drove differences in deaths and cases across classes, we calculated the correlations between within-class standardized covariate means (Figures 1–3D) and the within-class effects. Furthermore, given the same number of employees, cities with lower population densities would experience small or negligible increases in death rates after lifting restrictions (e.g., Class 4 versus 5, and Class 1 versus 2, Figure 1A). Of note, the number of employees plays a dominant role in determining the degree of increase because the floating volume is proportional to the square of the number of employees. Our results highlight the need for city-specific lifting strategies in China.

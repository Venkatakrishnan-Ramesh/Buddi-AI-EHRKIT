Hip pain is a common symptom in elderly patients presenting to the emergency department and has a very broad differential (1, 2). Iliopsoas injuries are typically secondary to trauma, especially in young athletes. At 3.5 months after initial injury, she had improved remarkably since the initial evaluation, was able to walk without any assistive device, perform squats independently, could lunge walk, and even walk backwards engaging the hip flexors well. Findings of abnormal signal intensity on T1 and T2-weighted images, proximal muscle thickening, mass effect on the anterior hip joint, and interruption of the psoas tendon with preserved lateral iliacus muscle insertion fibres are consistent with a rupture of the distal iliopsoas tendon (4)..With the recent advent of diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound, a skilled ultrasonographer may be able to diagnose this solely by ultrasound (16, 17). There is a paucity of literature on iliopsoas rupture treatment, including surgical management.

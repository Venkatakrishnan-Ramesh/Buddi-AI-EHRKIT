Our case report is unique in a number of ways. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation was considered and deferred, and an implantable loop recorder was placed. However, side effects including neutropenia, diarrhea, and mucositis are significantly reduced with infusion compared to bolus and thus are the preferred route of administration [5]. In metastatic colorectal cancer, 5-FU infusion has shown a significantly improved response rate, and fewer toxicities compared to bolus dosing [9].To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report documenting successful de novo 5-FU administration in a patient with pre-existing coronary artery vasospasm.

Solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) plays an important role in the formulation stage. Powder sample equivalent to 7 mg of pure CA was accurately weighed and placed in the dissolution medium kept at 37 ± 0.5°C at stirring speed of 50 rpm. An empty pan also was used as a reference. However, this difference was not significant for surfactant-free samples (CM and CT) (P > 0.05). The dissolution profiles of the formulations (SDs and PMs) containing different ratios of CA: F68 are depicted in Figure 1A. Seemingly, the wet milling of the drug without using surfactant and its freeze-drying in the absence (CAM) or presence of mannitol (CM) enhanced the drug dissolution by 30-50% during the first 30 min. The reduced peak intensities for wet milled particles compared to their related PMs were likely attributable to the partial formation of some amorphous structures in those samples as well as to the decreased drug crystallinity. Seemingly, surrounding the drug particles with both type of surfactants enhanced the drug in vitro performance. This may have been due to the formation of amorphous structures following preparation process, verified by XRD analysis.

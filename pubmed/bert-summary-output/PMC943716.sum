CLASS has been proved to be a safe and effective approach for POAG patients. Both surgical strategies have favorable safety and efficacy among POAG patients. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) was performed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 M and other situations of unexpected IOP elevation. Postoperative interventions were described as previously [17]. At each visit, if PAS at the filtrating area was confirmed by gonioscopy and UBM examination, a Nd:YAG laser synechiolysis was performed in clinic to remove iris obstruction and reopen the filtration site. Comparing CLASS alone and Class + Phaco, the success rate in standalone group was significantly higher than in combination group in our current study, which was consistent with a previous Singapore study [22]. The 1-year success rate of combination surgery varied significantly among previous studies. reported an overall success rate of 88.0% in a Chinese population [20]. Our study yielded similar results in CLASS group, but a lower CS% and QS% in CLASS + Phaco group. A longer-term usage of multiple antiglaucoma medications might lead to a greater inflammatory reaction and higher scarring tendency [25]. In addition, success rate was calculated based on baseline IOP in our study (IOP reduction of ≥ 20% from baseline).

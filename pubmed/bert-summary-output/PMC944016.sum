Recommended first-line treatments for advanced melanoma include nivolumab plus ipilimumab (NIVO + IPI) and BRAF + MEK inhibitor (BRAFi + MEKi) combinations (for BRAF-mutant disease).At the time of this analysis, there was no head-to-head comparison of NIVO + IPI and BRAFi + MEKi combinations reported from a clinical trial setting in the literature, although indirect treatment comparisons have shown a clear survival benefit associated with NIVO + IPI versus BRAFi + MEKi combinations. This analysis evaluated the cost-utility of NIVO + IPI in the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma using extrapolations of 5-year OS data from CheckMate 067 [6], which were the most current data available at the time of the analysis from a third-party US-payer perspective. The recommended oral doses of BRAK + MEK inhibitor combinations were used in the cost calculations. AE frequencies and corresponding AE costs are provided in the Electronic Supplementary Appendix (Section 6). In contrast, the PFS curves afforded a consistent approach because, with the exception of IPI, these treatments are generally administered until progression. To test the impact of assumptions made in the model, including survival extrapolation and treatment cap, scenario analyses were also conducted as follows:selecting secondary (i.e., second best-fitting) parametric distribution for IPI reference curve;setting 5-year maximum treatment duration for I-O therapies (NIVO + IPI, NIVO, PEMBRO).

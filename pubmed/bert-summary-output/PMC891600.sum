Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is a mechanism used by bacteria to promote the use of a preferred carbon source in an environment where other substrates are also available (1). Apart from being an sRNA, Spot 42 RNA resembles a short mRNA. However, an early study examining the affinity between Spot 42 and the 70S ribosome reported that although the RNA bound to ribosomes, it did so inefficiently and nonproductively (19). A) Diagram of the Spot 42 RNA and sequence of the spf promoter and coding region. B) Diagram of Spot 42 secondary structure (taken from ref. 1C), indicating that Spot 42 is also an mRNA encoding a 15–amino acid protein, hereafter referred to as SpfP. Interestingly, the levels of SpfP–SPA were higher at 42 °C and 45 °C than at 30 °C at the 5-min time point. D) Growth assays of Δspf::kan cells (GSO433) transformed with pRI, pRI-Spot42, pRI-Spot42STOP, pKK, pKK–SpfP-recoded, or pKK–SpfP-recoded STOP. For B, C, and D, bars correspond to the average of three biological replicates with circles corresponding to individual data points and error bars representing 1 SD. Cells were grown in M63 lactose to an OD600 of ∼0.5. We also examined the ability of the L51M, L62F, S84R, and S180Y mutants to block the inhibitory effect of SpfP on GalM–SPA expression by transforming a galM-SPA Δcrp Δspf strain carrying pKK, pKK–SpfP-recoded, or pKK–SpfP-recodedSTOP with the plasmids expressing crp or one of the four mutants (Fig. For A and B, samples were collected at an OD600 of ∼0.5. It is worth noting that, due to the recoded sequence, the spfP ribosome-binding site and start codon likely are no longer in a stem-loop structure, probably allowing equal translation at all temperatures. Another factor to consider is the Hfq RNA chaperone protein, which is required for Spot 42 stability and base-pairing function (14).

However, M1 and M2 macrophages cannot be differentiated clearly [2, 5, 14, 16, 18, 19, 25, 28, 30].Microglia, which have phagocytic functions, are present in the brain and are referred to as “brain macrophages.” In the case of a disease condition, the shape of macrophages changes from the ramified-type to activated-type with residual dendrites and phagocytic-type macrophages that are round and lost their dendrites [30]. Thus, macrophages change their form and function in response to the environment and function as sensors that reflect the biological condition in real-time. Hemotoxylin and eosin (HE) stained and immunomultiplexed specimens were used to take 20 images in each region (5 in all) with an upright microscope (Axio Imager 2, Carl Zeiss) at 400×. The ratio of M1 macrophages (positive only for Iba1) and M2 macrophages (positive for both Iba1 and CD163) were measured. M1 macrophages were significant in normal and borderline areas, whereas M2 macrophages were significant in tumor areas (p < 0.05) (Fig. The percentage of M2 macrophages in the relapsed cases is shown below. METs are a form of cell death similar to NETs.

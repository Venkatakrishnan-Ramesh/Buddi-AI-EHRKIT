The transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the early part of pandemic was predominantly thought to be due to droplet infection, fomite, and airborne. The participants in the study were consultants and trainee anesthesiologists. We defined recommended and desired HH times for standardization of the observation. We noticed that 47.2% of anesthesiologists disposed of the PPE inside OT and the rest of the disposals happened after shifting the patient to post anesthesia care unit (PACU). With standard PPE usage (N95 mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves), the risk of transmission was found to be minimal and thus the anxiety about optimal PPE availability during AGPs in the COVID-19 pandemic was found to be as high as 70% and availability of PPE did not guarantee the adequate compliance to new policies which ensured the safety of HCWs. Locally made acrylic boxes[10] were tried in only a limited number of cases in our study mainly due to inconvenience while intubating, increased time of intubation hence aerosolization, and decreased success rate in the first attempt.

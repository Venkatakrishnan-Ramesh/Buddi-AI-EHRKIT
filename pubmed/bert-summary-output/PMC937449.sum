In December 2019, an unidentified pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China, and by early January 2020, the causative agent had been identified as a novel coronavirus now called SARS-CoV-2. 2020), and a screen of a 3,000 compound library (Dittmar et al., Lower panel: outcomes for 190 replicate wells for each treatment are shown. Scale is the same as for images in part C.To identify compounds with dose responses, grade potency, and maximize the value of the full screening set for target discovery, four doses of each compound were tested, ranging from 8 nM to 8 μM in 10-fold increments. Refer to Figure S3 for an interactive version with higher detail.(D) Relationship of enriched protein drug targets (red circles) or unenriched targets (pink circles) with active compounds (blue circles) for compounds with annotated targets in the DRH database.(E) Separation heatmap between the targets of different activity classes within the human protein–protein interaction network.

Figure 3Concentration response curves for active compounds and the measurement of small molecule effect on mRNA production from the virus subgenomic promoter by FISH assay in Huh7 cells(A) Examples of response curves are shown for the indicated active compounds using treatment concentrations ranging from 4 μM down to 0.2 nM. Each concentration was repeated in triplicate and average and standard deviations shown and normalized to vehicle (DMSO)-treated controls.(B) Virus mRNA production was measured by in situ oligonucleotide-based detection. The scale bar in the top left image is 100 μm. These compounds were the DHFR inhibitor pralatrexate, the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor talniflumate, the BET inhibitors BET-BAY-002 and mivebresib, and the methyltransferase inhibitor BIX-01294, suggesting that each also worked to disrupt packaging of viral genomes into new virus particles and/or their release into the culture medium. Of the compounds evaluated, omipalisib and BAY-2402234 most potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped LV entry by >95%, p < 0.05 (Figure 4), though similar inhibition was also observed against vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped LV, suggesting these molecules likely targeted a post-entry step. Lentivirus pseudotypes, encoding firefly luciferase, as a marker of infection, and bearing the SARS-CoV-2 or VSV glycoproteins (VSV-G) were used to transduce cells at 20 ng of p24 capsid equivalent per infection. As some of the compounds of interest had potentially protonatable amines, a hallmark of PLD inducers, we evaluated each by staining for accumulation of a fluorescently labeled lipid (NBD-PE), but found that none induced PLD (Figure S8), even when tested at >100 times higher than their antiviral active concentrations. However, the gastrointestinal model cells expressed ACE2 mRNA and protein (Figure S9) and gave robust, uniform infection (Figure 5A). Infection efficiency was measured by the total fluorescence relative to DMSO-treated controls and normalized to the cell nuclei signal (right panel). Each test was performed in triplicate with average and standard deviations shown. For each mouse tissue sample, two measurements were made and averaged. Each was performed in triplicate and averages with standard deviations are shown. (C) Beta and delta virus strains were tested for the susceptibility to small molecule treatments tested at the indicated doses (close to EC90) seen in the Washington strain using A549-ACE2 cells. Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney) and A549 (male lung epithelium) cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Infection efficiency was calculated as the ratio of infected cells to total cell nuclei. Each had a common tail that bound to a complementary sequence on an oligonucleotide conjugated to a Cy5 fluor. For each set of genes, we performed a biological function enrichment using Enrichr (Chen et al.,

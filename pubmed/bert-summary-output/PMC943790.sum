Pyogenic brain abscess poses a significant management challenge to clinicians. Brain abscesses are associated with substantial morbidity and short- and long-term mortality.2 Our understanding of the factors associated with treatment failure that correlate with poorer clinical outcomes in patients with brain abscesses remains limited, however.3,4In the present investigation, we aimed to profile characteristics of patients presenting with pyogenic brain abscesses and assess outcomes according to early surgical versus medical treatment alone while adjusting for the propensity to receive surgery. Covariates in the model were limited to a number the sample could support and were chosen a priori based on clinical relevance: age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), pre-existing CNS hardware, midline shift, and the number (single vs. multiple) and size of brain abscesses. Cumulative incidence of treatment failure at 6 months in patients with pyogenic brain abscess managed with medical alone versus early surgical treatment. In multivariable analysis, a higher CCI and pre-existing CNS hardware were both independent predictors of therapeutic failure, regardless of medical or surgical management strategy. Brian D.

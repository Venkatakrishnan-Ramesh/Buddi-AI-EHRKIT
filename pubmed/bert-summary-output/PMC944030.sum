In February 2017, pembrolizumab became the first immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) approved and reimbursed in Japan for first-line monotherapy of unresectable advanced and metastatic NSCLC with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score (TPS) greater than or equal to 50%. The median patient follow-up time was 13.5 months (range: <0.1 to 26.9 mo) from pembrolizumab initiation to date of death, end of patient follow-up, or data cutoff (September 30, 2019), whichever occurred first. Percentages may not add up to 100 because of rounding. For context, the median pembrolizumab treatment duration was 7.9 months (95% CI: 6.2–11.7) in the KEYNOTE-024 clinical trial and 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.9–8.5) in the KEYNOTE-042 clinical trial subset of patients with PD-L1 TPS greater than or equal to 50%.20,21,32 The somewhat shorter rwToT estimate for the first-line pembrolizumab-treated population in the current study relative to those two KEYNOTE trials could be related to either patient characteristics or operational factors unique to the clinical or real-world setting in Japan. Moreover, this was an observational study that was designed to be descriptive in nature, thus limiting our ability to make comparisons between subgroups that may have differed in the distribution of prognostic factors.

In December 2019, a cluster of patients affected by severe pneumonia triggered by a novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. A 1.5-year-old boy had cough and tachypnoea 24 h before hospitalization. The authors suggested that IL-6 levels are an independent risk factor of severe disease course, and changes in IL-6 levels depending on stage of disease can be used as a marker for disease monitoring [11].The role of IL-6 and other cytokines in what could be a distinct neutrophil-like lung inflammation, with associated inflammatory driven pulmonary vascular disease, awaits clarification; in fact, we do not know the real role of neutrophils in lung damage.

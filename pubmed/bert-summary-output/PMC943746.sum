The purpose of this Technical Note is to describe our preferred method of primary AC and revision CC reconstruction using a combination of autograft and allograft semitendinosus as well as TightRope fixation. Tunnel is drilled at the midline of the acromion and a stay suture is placed through. The semitendinosus allograft (graft #1) is passed inferior to superior around the posterior aspect of the clavicle, using a passing suture (Fig 5). At conclusion, reduction is confirmed using intraoperative fluoroscopy. Patients are expected to return to full activity at 4 months’ postoperatively. Such anatomic restoration has been reported to closely replicate the properties of the native CC ligaments more than traditional techniques, such as the Weaver–Dunn procedure, which involves distal clavicle excision and transfer of the coracoacromial ligament.18, 19, 20 It should be noted that anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligament is not without limitations.

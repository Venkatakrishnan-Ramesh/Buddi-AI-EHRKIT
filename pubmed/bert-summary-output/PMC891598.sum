Bacteria are exposed to rapidly changing environmental conditions, such as variations in carbon availability and pH. To survive these fluctuating conditions, bacterial cells have fast, flexible, and energy-efficient mechanisms to regulate protein levels and activity at all levels. Base-pairing sRNAs generally are thought not to encode proteins and thus are often referred to as noncoding RNAs. The levels of the tagged small protein are elevated for growth in glucose compared to glycerol due to CRP-mediated repression in the absence of glucose. Thus, the AzuCR transcript has mRNA and sRNA activities impacting the utilization of different carbon sources. Though it is possible the SPA tag has an unnatural stabilizing effect on AzuC, the discordance between AzuC-SPA protein levels and AzuCR RNA levels in glycerol pH 5.5 raised the possibility that translation, RNA stability, and protein stability is regulated and that the protein and RNA may have different roles. Insets provide a 2.3× enlargement of a few cells. ( Cells expressing either AzuC-SPA (GSO351) or GlpD-HA-His6 (GSO1011) from the chromosome were grown in M63 glucose or M63 glycerol media, respectively, to OD600 ∼1.0 and mixed in a 1:1 ratio. AzuC increases GlpD activity and membrane association. ( Lines correspond to the average of three biological replicates, and error bars represent 1 SD. ( Given that AzuC is an amphipathic helix and GlpD is a peripheral membrane protein (21) whose activity is reported to be increased by amphipaths (25), we hypothesized AzuC might function by increasing GlpD association with the inner membrane when cells are grown in M63 glycerol at low pH. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed higher levels of GlpD, C-terminally tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), at the membrane in WT compared to ΔazuCR cells (Fig. B) Effect of AzuCR and AzuCRL3STOP overexpression on a cadA-gfp fusion in WT and ΔazuCR backgrounds. Interactions between FnrS, an sRNA induced under anaerobic conditions, and AzuCR were detected in genome-wide assays of RNA–RNA interactions on the Hfq chaperone (29, 30), and we predicted base pairing between the 5′ end of FnrS and a sequence 25 to 31 nt upstream of the azuC ORF (SI Appendix, Fig. B) Model for the different functions of the AzuCR RNA. 3B), we suggest that AzuC increases dehydrogenase activity by promoting GlpD binding to the cytoplasmic membrane.

Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome or Marshall syndrome are characterized by recurrent episodes of fever lasting for a few days with a recurrence at every 3â€“8 weeks, associated with at least one of three main signs: aphthous stomatitis, cervical adenitis and pharyngitis.1 The fever episodes have little or no response to common antipyretics. Current treatment of PFAPA includes corticosteroids in acute episodes and tonsillectomy, but there is not a consensus due to a lack of large clinical trials.18,19The aim of this study was to describe the demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of a cohort of Romanian children diagnosed with PFAPA syndrome. Furthermore, a higher rate of publications regarding this disorder and greater familiarity with this disease have reduced the delay in diagnosis in recent years. Although PFAPA syndrome is considered a benign condition with spontaneous resolution, most often it is associated with a considerable burden for the child and the parents in their daily activities.58,59 Colchicine was not used in our study group, although other studies reported its efficiency.32,60,61Tonsillectomy was performed in only 3 children with total remission of the symptoms.

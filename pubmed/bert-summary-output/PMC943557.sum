First described by the British radiologist G.Q. Chance in 1948, Chance fractures are unstable spine fractures that affect all three columns of a vertebra.1,2 These injuries are commonly located in the thoracolumbar junction (T10–L2) and are often seen with concurrent abdominal injuries.3,4Chance fractures can be divided into subtypes, which include osseous, ligamentous, or osseoligamentous. Fortunately, neurological deficits rarely present with Chance fractures.4Surgical intervention for Chance fractures is warranted if there are neurological deficits, kyphosis >15°, unstable posterior elements, or if it is consistent with the ligamentous subtype.14,15 The optimal treatment strategy remains largely controversial, where strategies range from surgical fusion to nonoperative bracing. Although short-segment fixation has been reported for osseous Chance fractures, long-segment posterior fixation for flexion-distraction injuries with pedicle screws continues to be the most established surgical treatment in the literature.14,19,20 Our case complements the recent reports recommending more extensive fixation for severe multilevel spinal injuries, based on the outcomes experienced by our patient.8,9We presented a case of an 18-year-old male who underwent percutaneous stabilization for double-level noncontiguous Chance fractures that were sustained in a rollover MVA.

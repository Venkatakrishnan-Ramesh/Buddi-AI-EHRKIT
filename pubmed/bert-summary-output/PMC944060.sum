The lack of corneal donor tissue in many parts of the world necessitates investigation of pharmacologic and cell-based therapies for endothelial degeneration initially in animal models followed by clinical trials in human patients. For all analyses, a P value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Five dogs, the Boston terriers and Jack Russell terrier, were presumed to have corneal endothelial dystrophy based on breed and age of onset, whereas the remaining seven dogs were diagnosed with age-related endothelial degeneration. Box plots depict median, mean (X), and 25th and 75th percentiles. Only one (20%) of the improved eyes and one (12.5%) of the stable eyes received topical hypertonic saline during the treatment period. Seventeen historical control eyes of 10 dogs were selected to approximately match the age, breed/size, and stage of disease at baseline as the ripasudil-treated eyes. The log-rank test identified a significant difference in distribution of time to edema progression between eyes receiving and not receiving topical ripasudil (P = 0.023) with less progression in the ripasudil treatment group. documented disease progression in CED-affected dogs based on the extent and severity of corneal edema over time.34 Using the same progression criteria applied to eyes in the current study, we demonstrated a statistically significant difference in corneal edema progression with and without ripasudil therapy. Topical ripasudil was well-tolerated in PCED-affected dogs with conjunctival hyperemia being the most common adverse event observed, consistent with previous tolerability studies.41,42 An additional adverse event was the development of reticular bullous epithelial edema, which has also been reported in a series of human patients receiving the topical ROCK inhibitor netarsudil.43,44 However, unlike in human patients, the reticular bullous epithelial edema was transient in these dogs and resolved without discontinuation of ripasudil as this change was appreciated at some visits but not all.

Despite all the attention focused on COVID-19 hospital admissions and mortality rates, relatively little attention has been paid to readmission rates after a COVID-19 hospitalization. Overall, 397 (5.0%) patients in Alberta and 1307 (5.8%) patients in Ontario were readmitted or died within 7 days of hospital discharge; within 90 days, these frequencies were 1169 (14.8%) in Alberta and 3356 (14.9%) in Ontario, respectively (Appendix 2, eTable 2). In earlier work evaluating outcomes during the first 3 waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta and Ontario, we showed that vaccination improved outcomes in both provinces (pooled adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.41 [95% CI 0.32–0.53] for death and 0.22 [95% CI 0.18–0.26) for hospital admission).34We acknowledge that our outcome data do not capture the full burden of “long COVID”14,17 that did not result in hospital readmission. Given the retrospective design of our study, bias from unknown confounders is always possible.

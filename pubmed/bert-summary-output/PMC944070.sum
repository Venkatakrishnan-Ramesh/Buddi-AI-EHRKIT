Treatment options for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) vary according to disease stage, performance status, and liver function.1 Systemic therapy is recommended for unresectable HCC patients with adequate liver function who are not candidates for locoregional therapy. Pre-contrast, arterial phase, portal phase and delayed phase attenuation were recorded by placing region of interest (ROI) on the viable enhancing portions of the tumor. Abbreviations: INR, international normalized ratio; IQR, interquartile range; MELD, model for end-stage liver disease. Multivariate analysis including variables that were statistically significant on univariate analysis was conducted. Notes: Note that only parameters that reached statistical significance on univariate analysis (p<0.05, indicated in bold) are listed above; analyses of other variables are detailed in the supplementary material. Attenuation of HCC on pre-contrast CT images has been associated with tumor differentiation, with 75% of poorly differentiated lesions demonstrating lower attenuation compared to the liver parenchyma and 2/3 of hyperattenuating lesions being well differentiated.19 In the current study, low attenuation (<40 HU) of HCC on unenhanced CT images was significantly associated with worse overall survival and it was an independent prognostic factor at multivariate analysis, particularly in patients who had received prior therapy.

On April 5, 2022, the United Kingdom (UK) International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of 10 cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in previously healthy children under 10 years of age in Scotland. Nine cases had symptom onset during March 2022, and one had an earlier onset in January 2022. For all five patients, extensive etiology workup for infectious and metabolic etiologies were negative.13In the study conducted in Kingâ€™s College Hospital in the UK, the authors describe the course of eight children admitted to pediatric intensive care unit from February to May 2022.14 The main reason for admission was neurologic deterioration (hepatic encephalopathy) with rising ammonia, lactate, and international normalized ratio. Adenoviruses are very common and may only be an incidental finding. In fact, the virus can be detected in the intestine for a much longer period in children than in adults.2 Repeated release of viral protein in the intestinal epithelium would result in activation of the immune system.

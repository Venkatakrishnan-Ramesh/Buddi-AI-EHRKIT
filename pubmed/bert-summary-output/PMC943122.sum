Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer overall (fourth most common in men), and the second most frequently diagnosed genitourinary cancer in the United States. AUA and European Urologic Association (EUA) guidelines are outlined in Table 1 [7â€“9].The treatment algorithm differs by risk category. Those who received BCG had significantly reduced tumor recurrence at one year follow up [19]. The six-week induction course of intravesical BCG is now utilized for intermediate and high-risk disease, as mentioned above. Adequate BCG therapy is defined as at least 2 courses of BCG. In January of 2020, Pembrolizumab was approved for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive, high-risk NMIBC [45]. Approval was based on the Phase II clinical trial, KEYNOTE-057 (NCT02625961), a single arm study of 101 patients treated with Pembrolizumab [46]. Because it was a single arm study, the study is limited by a lack of a direct comparator group. An ongoing phase II multicenter trial (NCT02365818) found a 47% complete response rate at 6 months for BCG unresponsive high-grade disease, with an even stronger response for those with CIS specifically [49]. A larger sample size and longer duration of follow-up should be assessed in future trials, as only 45 patients were assessed at 6 months. A clinical trial (NCT02720367) was conducted on 12 NMIBC patients in the Netherlands, though data has not yet been reported [53].Hyperthermic intravesical chemotherapy is another new mechanism of drug delivery. NMIBC is a challenging malignancy to treat due to its significant risk for recurrence and progression, and is associated with high health care costs.

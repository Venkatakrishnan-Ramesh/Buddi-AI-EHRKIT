Before social change, there is discussion of social change. By establishing a link between BLM’s political rallies and increased use of antiracist terminology, we show how political movements change society beyond the political sphere. 1 describes the shift in use of terms associated with BLM, from multiple starting points until 2020. BLM protest is followed by a distinct increase in usage of antiracist terms. 2, Middle shows that abrupt increases, or “spikes,” in searches for “Black Lives Matter” often cooccur with protest events, which are denoted with dashed vertical lines. SI Appendix, Table S1 lists these terms, which include names of police shooting victims, slogans, and policy issues. To account for these temporal variations, we also present the results of a generalized additive model (GAM) that estimates the effect of time on the coactivation of the selected antiracist terms. Future research can attempt to quantify how the typical day-to-day attention given to these terms is related to scholastic activities. By examining these categories separately, we can understand the discursive evolution of the antiracism movement while taking into account the unique role that particular protests have in creating a platform for selected subsets of ideas. All other points are the bootstrapped coefficients for expected change in search volume of protests of a particular era. The GAM models predict search volume increases during BLM protest periods. Pages for ideas that critique racial hierarchy, such as “White privilege” and “White supremacy,” show small increases in attention. Pages for radical and relatively lesser-known 1960s civil rights leaders Angela Davis and Stokely Carmichael had large increases in traffic, whereas Martin Luther King Jr.’s page shows only a slight increase. This may have happened because Twitter aggressively banned White nationalists in the 6 mo following the rally. This hashtag enjoyed a much larger increase in use than the others during the George Floyd protests, although it tapers with a slightly sharper slope than #BlackLivesMatter (P < 0.001; SI Appendix, Table S5). Countermovement actions can also complicate this dynamic. Furthermore, the protests that have had the largest impact on the use of antiracist vocabulary are often the ones where footage of police violence was widely circulated to the public. Second, this research does not examine how antiracist words are used. Already, multiple studies have begun to document the ways that BLM has changed the way youth think about inequality and how parents speak to their children about race (46). These findings are relevant for researchers interested in social movements and long-term cultural change for two reasons.

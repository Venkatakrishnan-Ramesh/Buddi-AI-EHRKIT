A number of epidemiologic studies show that short sleep (≤6 h/d) is associated with a variety of physical impairments (1) and increased risk of all-cause mortality (2–5), cardiovascular disease (6, 7), and incident diabetes (8, 9). Study-specific approaches were permitted for modeling covariates (e.g., number of education categories, case deletion for missing covariates), depending on availability and prior established cohort-specific approaches. Model 1 included age, sex, field site, race, education, occupation, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, prevalent hypertension (treated or self-reported), prevalent dyslipidemia (treated or self-reported), prevalent coronary artery disease, BMI, and waist circumference. Model 2 was further adjusted for dietary and sleep-related variables: melatonin use, fish/seafood consumption, and HEI or fruit and vegetable consumption if HEI was unavailable. Pooled analyses comparing quintiles as indicator categories were consistent with these results, with statistically significant inverse associations across quintiles of EPA, DHA, and EPA + DPA + DHA with long sleep duration (Figure 4). These findings, in a well-powered, biomarker-assessed, diverse study suggest a specificity of association for very long-chain n-3 PUFA biomarkers and long sleep duration, and to our knowledge, this study represents the most comprehensive examination to date of the associations between circulating PUFAs and measures of sleep. Cohorts spanned 5 countries and included populations with diverse background diets, environmental settings, and lifestyle practices, making it less likely that any single confounder would explain our results, and increasing the generalizability of our findings. Biomarker assessment of PUFAs reflects both diet and metabolism and is not influenced by misreporting of dietary intake.

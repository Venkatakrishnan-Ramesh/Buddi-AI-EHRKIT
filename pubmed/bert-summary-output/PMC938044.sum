Based on the range of involvement, it can be divided into limited type and diffuse type. There was no control group in this study. Non-intubated surgery with spontaneous respiration was performed after tracheal stent (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, USA) implantation. Two patients presented recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and the voice was improved 3 months after surgery. Therefore, the correct selection of anesthesia methods is helpful to improve the success rate of surgery and the postoperative quality of life. Therefore, before non-tracheal intubation in this study, it was confirmed that the stenotic ring was located 2 cm below the glottis, the tracheomalacia test was negative, and the stenosis was grade Iâ€“II in the Cotton-Myer grading system. In these cases, a transcervical incision becomes particularly important.

The rates of primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft failure have been reported to be as high as 25%,1 and there are more than 200,000 primary ACL reconstructions (ACLR) performed annually.1,2 Most patients with revision ACLR return to a lower level of function when compared to their prerevision state.1 Increasing attention has been paid to intrinsic bony architecture, such as posterior tibial slope (PTS), as a predisposing risk factor for ACLR failure. We recommend calculating osteotomy wedge height (WH) using the following formula, which requires only measurement of the PTS and tibial width (TW):Fig 1(A-C) Demonstration of how tibial sagittal width influences the osteotomy wedge height. A and B both show a supra-tubercular approach to deflexion. ( Both Patient A and B have a native posterior tibial slope of 17Â°. Additionally, most trans-tubercular techniques recommend orienting the resection wedge proximal toward the metadiaphyseal junction, which changes the orientation of the triangle and further affects wedge height. As the bone cut is completed, fluoroscopy is used to ensure proper angle and depth, taking care to not violate the posterior cortex. It is crucial to clean this area of the knee after removal of bone, so the osteotomy closes nicely when the knee is gently extended.

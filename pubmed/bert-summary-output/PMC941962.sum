The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by a lot of conflicting information about the COVID-19 vaccination on social media. As observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, disinformation has been widespread since the beginning of the pandemic. Media literacy is a relatively new approach to help people watch the content they ordinarily receive and consume. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we found that the data sets for media literacy and willingness to be vaccinated and their dimensions follow a normal distribution. In fact, students are not able to accurately select their needed information, and, as a result, they are readily influenced by media propaganda on the COVID-19 vaccine. There was a relatively good correlation between critical thinking about media message and willingness to be vaccinated. The findings of their study are in line with those of the present study. The researchers did their best to remove this limitation by reassuring the participants to keep the confidentiality of individualsâ€™ information and report the results via codes.

The crystalline lens maintains transparency for light transmission, refraction, and accommodation, ensuring that light is focused onto the retina. To facilitate this function, lens development experiences a series of unique and significant processes. cDNA was mixed with SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Q331-02; Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China), and quantitative PCR was performed using an ABI QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Right) Higher magnifications of boxed areas. As mentioned before, degradation of nuclei and organelles occurs in terminally differentiated fiber cells. D) Quantification of BiP and CHOP expression levels of the WT and Jamc−/− lenses at P14, as seen in C. The fold change relative to the level of control groups is displayed. E) Representative immunofluorescent staining images of P7 WT and Jamc−/− lenses in cryosections for BiP (green). Nuclei and other organelles degrade when lens epithelial cells differentiate into lens fiber cells and migrate from the equatorial area to the central area, thus minimizing light scatter and ensuring the transparency of the lens.28 It has been reported that nuclear breakdown is accompanied by the rapid loss of other organelles, including the mitochondria and ER.29–32 We found an abundance of retained nuclei in the presumptive OFZ of Jamc−/− lenses. DNase II-like acid DNase IIβ (DLAD), which is believed to be involved in the degradation of DNA in terminal lens fiber cells, is a lysosomal enzyme.33 We noted that the LAMP1 expression level was obviously decreased in mouse lenses after Jamc deletion (Figs.

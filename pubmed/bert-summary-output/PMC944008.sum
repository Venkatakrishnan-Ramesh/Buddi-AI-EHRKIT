Al–Cu alloys have a high strength-to-density ratio, and good fatigue and damage tolerance, which is widely used in aerospace and engineering structure applications [1], [2], [3]. Nowadays, a large number of aircrafts have reached the end of their service life. Al-10Mg and 0.2 % Al-5Ti-1B master alloys were added into the melts under mechanical stirring to reduce the Mg loss in the alloys. Also, a thermocouple located in the centre of mould was used to record the cooling curves during solidification. 2The solidification sequences of different alloys calculated using Thermo-Calc software:(a) 0.7Fe alloy; (b) 1.2Fe alloy; (c) the vertical section of Al-4.5Cu-0.5Mn-0.5Mg-0.2Si-xFe (x = 0–2) alloys. The EBSD maps along the x direction in the studied alloys and the inverse pole figures (IPF), are shown in Fig. In the USMP process, a gradient of grain sizes is found from the horn to the bottom of the ingot. The EDS element mapping of the four alloys produced without USMP are illustrated in Fig. USMP is an efficient method for reduce the segregation of TiB2 particles and promotes their heterogenous nucleation. SEM images and EBSD phase mapping, Kikuchi patterns of different phase in the studied alloys: (a1-a3) 0.7Fe alloy; (b1-b3) 0.7FeB alloy; (c1-c3) 1.2Fe alloy; (d1-d3) 1.2FeB alloy; (e1-e3) 1.2FeUB alloy; (a4-a7, e4) Kikuchi patterns of different Fe-rich phases. However, the combination of UMSP and Al-Ti-B have a better grain refinement efficiency, with the 0.7Fe alloy presenting the smallest grain size. The different refinement mechanisms are mainly related to the melt temperature: 1) above the liquidus temperature and 2) temperature between liquidus and solid temperature (semi-solid temperature zone). The Fe-rich phases in 0.7FeB and 0.7FeU alloys are better dispersed, because the USMP disperse the Fe-rich phases and TiB2 promotes a heterogeneous nucleation.

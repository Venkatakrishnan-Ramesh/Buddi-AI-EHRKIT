Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone cancer in young people (1). We conducted database inquiries for patients with a conventional, high-grade osteosarcoma diagnosis who had pre- (PreC) and post-chemotherapy (PostC) radiographs of the primary tumor from lateral side obtained prior to resection. Their methods did not allow for radiograph normalization and relied on the human eye’s minimum noticeable change in input intensity—the so-called “increment threshold”—which is known to be inexact (11), for evaluating differences in radiograph luminance; they found no correlation between mineralization and treatment response. Lindner developed a four-tiered system of evaluating local host response on histological examination and found significant correlation both to tumor necrosis and to mineralization on CT (14).

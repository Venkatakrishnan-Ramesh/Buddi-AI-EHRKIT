Coracoid process fractures continue to be rare. A coracoid nonunion is clearly visible on this image and highlighted by the red arrow. This MRI scan demonstrates no enhancement at the fracture site as highlighted by the red arrow. Modified versions of the A, D, E, H, and I portals can be used for this procedure. Subscapularis tendon indicated by red arrow. A right shoulder in a patient in the beach chair position. The arthroscopic shaver is introduced through an accessory portal directly superior to the coracoid process (H portal). The coracoid is being viewed through an accessory anterolateral portal (D portal). The technique they describe demonstrates reduction of the base of the coracoid back to the glenoid, whereas our technique demonstrates how to arthroscopically fix a fracture distal to the CC ligaments.

The lung is a vital and complex organ with multiple cell types specifically designed for efficient gas exchange between the outside environment and the blood. In the high-dose model, collagen deposition was mostly observed in collapsed alveolar regions (Figure 1C). Twenty-one days after administration of low-dose BLM, lineage-positive AT1 cells appeared in both Scgb1a1-rtTA (Line 1)/(tetO)7CMV-Cre mice (upper middle) and in Sftpc-CreERT2/ROSAmT/mG mice (lower middle) with well-maintained alveolar structures. On day 21, the accumulation of lineage-negative AT2 cells progress. Scale bars: 300 μm in a and c. Scale bars: 100 μm in e, f, and j. ∗p <0.05, ∗∗p <0.01. (B) The Ashcroft score in the low-dose BLM model was significantly lower than that in the high-dose BLM model on day 21 (n = 3 in each group). Isolated control AT2 cells from GFP mice (C-AT2) were cultured with lung mesenchymal cells from BLM-injured lungs (B-Mes) or control lungs (C-Mes) to assess the colony-forming efficacy (CFE) of AT2 cells. Data are represented as mean ± SEM in c and e. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed in c. ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer test was performed in e.To further explore the phenotypic changes in lung mesenchymal cells after BLM injury, we next performed microarray analysis on C-Mes and B-Mes Figure 2G). These cells were also negative for fibroblast markers, such as desmin and αSMA (Figure 3I), not supporting epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mouse lungs were dissociated and analyzed for GFP expression with surface markers. Note that the αSMA+ myofibroblasts disappeared. (P) The same number (2.5×103 cells) of freshly isolated AT2 cells from C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP) mice and ROSAmT/mG mice were mixed and cultured with lung mesenchymal cells isolated from high-dose BLM model mice (C57BL/6J mice) on day 10 in a 24-well Transwell insert. At 11 dpt, exogenous transplanted AT2 cells (ncGFP-AT2) engrafted and formed alveolar epithelial colonies (Figures S2B and S2C), which were in close proximity to fibrotic areas and surrounded by AT2 cells with no GFP expression (endogenous AT2 cells differentiated from non-AT2 cells). To further characterize this microenvironment, other cellular components of the lungs were also transplanted. PDX, patient-derived xenograft; ADC, adenocarcinoma; LCNEC, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma; TNM, TNM classification based on the eighth edition of the Union for International Cancer Control classification; M, male; F, female. A single-cell suspension derived from surgically resected normal lung tissue distal enough to the cancer region was also intratracheally administered. On the basis of the interaction between activated mesenchymal cells and intact AT2 cells, AT2 cell transplantation facilitated alveolar regeneration by autonomous tissue reconstruction in the lung fibrogenic microenvironment, where lung cancer cells also formed tumor nests to establish an orthotopic xenograft model. 2020), which may also play a role in our model. Antibodies used for flow cytometry are listed in Key resources table. Murine lungs were inflated, fixed at 25 cm H2O with 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Statistical analyses were performed using JMP (ver.10, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major public health challenge. In surviving CA animals, adrenaline resulted in greater myocardial injury. 3), with the addition of early upregulation of IL6, TNF-α, CD68, and TGF-β observed at 24 h (all P < 0.01). While adrenaline improves macrocirculatory surrogates of perfusion such as mean arterial pressure, its impact on oxygen delivery and exchange, which occurs at the level of the microcirculation in capillary beds, is less well defined.19 In swine models of resuscitated cardiac arrest, intra-arrest adrenaline has been shown to result in reduced microcirculatory blood flow, assessed by orthogonal polarization spectral imaging of sublingual mucosa, following ROSC.20., David M.

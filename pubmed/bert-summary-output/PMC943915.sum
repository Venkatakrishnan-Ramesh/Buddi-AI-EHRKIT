Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of tumor-associated mortality.1 Intriguingly, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes more than 85% of all lung cancer cases.2,3 This group of cancers mainly include lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). All the procedures in the study complied with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its subsequent amendments. Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the independent prognostic ability of NCAPG. By evaluating the transcription data from TCGA-LUAD (Figure 1A and B) and TCGA-LUSC datasets (Figure 1C and D), in tandem with seven analyses of the Oncomine database (Table 1), NCAPG mRNA was established to be markedly over-expressed in both LUAD and LUSC tissues, relative to non-malignant lung tissues. A)The expression of NCAPG mRNA in LUAD tissues and normal lung tissues. ( However, NCAPG levels were not markedly correlated with OS and PFS for LUSC patients in TCGA-LUSC (Figure S2A) and GSE30219-LUSC datasets (Figure S2B, C). B) Multivariate analysis showing the impact of NCAPG on OS and PFS in patients with LUAD. ( By analyzing NCAPG CNAs in 512 LUAD patients, we found that, although low copy gain and amplification (gain and amplification, n=89, 17.38%) was not frequent, it was still associated with markedly-increased NCAPG levels, relative to diploid patients (Figure 6A). A) The expression level of DElncRNAs AC099850.3, TMPO-AS1, and AC091057.1 was positively related to NCAPG level. ( B) The expression of AC099850.3 in LUAD tissues and adjacent non-malignant lung tissues in the TCGA-LUAD dataset. ( E) Correlation between NCAPG expression level and clinical response to EGFR-TKIs. *

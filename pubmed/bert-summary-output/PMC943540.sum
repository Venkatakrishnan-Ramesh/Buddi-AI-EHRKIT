For many years, coronaviruses have been considered a significant threat to public health due to their abundance in animal reservoirs and the severity of disease when zoonosis occurs (Cui et al., Glycans are critical for the correct folding of proteins and stabilize the resultant structure of the viral spike (Varki, 2017). With a 96% genome identity, RaTG13, found in Rhinolophus affinis (bats) in the Yunnan region of China, is the most similar sarbecovirus isolated to that of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., To contextualize the changes in glycosylation we generated structural models of the sarbecoviruses and modelled representative glycans onto the structure to investigate the 3-dimensional environment surrounding the N-linked glycan sites. Additionally, in every sample analyzed the glycan processing was nearly identical, with processed complex-type glycans dominating all sites in this region (Figure 2A). Of all the sarbecoviruses analyzed, RaTG13 and pang17 share the most amino acids with SARS-CoV-2 and understanding how the glycosylation diverges in such similar viruses is a key part of exploring the antigenic diversity of the sarbecovirus glycan shield. Highlighted in blue in Figure 5 are amino acids that differ between RaTG13 and pang17. Sites such as N165 have been shown to be sensitive to changes in the protein sequence, for example, the introduction of additional stabilizing mutations into the Wuhan hu1 SARS-CoV-2 spike, termed the HexaPro construct, demonstrated similar changes in glycosylation at this site (Chawla et al., The N-terminal region displayed the most variability, and this is reflected in SARS-CoV-2 variants, with the gamma variant containing the N20 glycosylation site not found in the original Wuhan strain. 2020), and its position and processing state were conserved across all samples analyzed. A total of 78 sequences were obtained and were aligned using Clustal Omega. The alkylated Env proteins were buffer-exchanged into 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 using Vivaspin columns (3 kDa) and two of the aliquots were digested separately overnight using trypsin, chymotrypsin (Mass Spectrometry Grade, Promega) or alpha lytic protease (Sigma Aldrich) at a ratio of 1:30 (w/w). Glycopeptide fragmentation data were extracted from the raw file using Byos (Version 3.5; Protein Metrics Inc.). All charge states for a single glycopeptide were summed.

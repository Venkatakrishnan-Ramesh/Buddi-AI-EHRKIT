Some participants received a lower dose of fluconazole than currently recommended in combination with AmBd. Study sponsored by study drug manufacturer, and role of funder not stated. Data from a single small study with few events and broad CI including appreciable benefit and appreciable harm. Rollout of combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the 1990s led to a large decline in incident HIV‐associated cryptococcal meningitis in high‐income countries, but a large burden of disease still exists in resource‐limited settings (Dromer 2004; Pyrgos 2013; Rajasingham 2017). Although guidelines exist for the antifungal management of cryptococcal meningitis, recommendations are based on limited data from RCTs, and in clinical practice treatment is highly variable due to drug costs, availability, and ability to monitor and manage drug‐related toxicities (Perfect 2010). Early fungicidal activity (EFA), or mean rate of fungal clearance in the first two weeks of antifungal therapy, has been shown to correlate with mortality and is frequently reported in phase two studies that are not powered to detect mortality differences and to inform larger studies (Bicanic 2009). Mean rate of fungal clearance (early fungicidal activity) in the first two weeks of antifungal therapy. We searched from 1 January 1980 up to 9 July 2018 without language restriction. In each pair‐wise comparison, for dichotomous outcome measures (for example, two‐week mortality) we obtained risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). All but one study was at low risk of attrition bias due to very low loss to follow‐up. One study was at unclear risk of reporting bias because primary and secondary outcomes were not clearly stated, and the authors reported results on multiple clinical and mycological outcomes (Leenders 1997). Compared to two weeks of 5FC and FLU, a one‐week regimen of AmBd and 5FC was associated with a higher risk of grade three or four hypokalaemia (RR 5.97, 95% CI 1.65 to 21.63; 338 participants, 1 study, Analysis 4.3: subgroup 4), but there was no difference with respect to other toxicities. In one study that evaluated DAIDS toxicity (Day 2013), neutropenia was more common with combined AmBd and 5FC than with AmBd alone (RR 4.46, 95% CI 0.99 to 20.10; 199 participants, 1 study, Analysis 7.3: subgroup 3), but the risk of other toxicities did not differ between groups. Forest plot of comparison: 9 Two weeks of AmBd + 5FC versus two weeks of AmBd + FLU, outcome: 9.2 Early fungicidal activity. A second study from a single centre in Uganda compared two weeks of 5FC 150 mg/kg/day in three divided doses and FLU 200 mg/day for two months with FLU 200 mg/day for two months, a suboptimal FLU dose (Mayanja‐Kizza 1998; Bicanic 2007; Longley 2008). Mortality up to 10 weeks and at six months was low in both arms, with no significant difference between groups (28 participants, 1 study, Analysis 15.1, Table 15: subgroups 2 and 3; very low‐certainty evidence). In the Brouwer 2004 study, mortality was very low at two and 10 weeks in all arms with no significant difference in survival observed between two weeks of AmBd and 5FC and FLU compared to two weeks of AmBd and 5FC (31 participants, 1 study, Analysis 17.1, Table 17: subgroups 1 and 2; low‐certainty evidence), two weeks of AmBd with FLU (32 participants, 1 study, Analysis 18.1, Table 18: subgroups 1 and 2; very low‐certainty evidence), and two weeks of AmBd alone (32 participants, 1 study, Analysis 19.1, Table 19: subgroups 1 and 2; very low‐certainty evidence). Of those comparisons for which heterogeneity could be assessed, no studies demonstrated statistical heterogeneity. A network plot for 10‐week mortality is shown in Figure 10. However, due to the limited amount of data available we are not able to draw firm conclusions regarding the presence of inconsistency in our networks. However, observational studies and data from RCTs not meeting the inclusion criteria for this review have consistently found very high mortality associated with the use of FLU monotherapy (Makadzange 2010; Rothe 2013). Changes made to the study protocol after publication and after the review process began are detailed in the Differences between protocol and review section.

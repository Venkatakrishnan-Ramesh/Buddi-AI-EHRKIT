Glaucoma is a multifactorial progressive optic neuropathy, characterized by advanced neurodegeneration of the eye's retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Among those, the logistic regression analysis showed that only severe RNFL damage (i.e., red color) in the inferior quadrant was significantly associated with 5-year glaucomatous progression (Table 2). Similar to the OHTS, the EGPS found central corneal thickness was a powerful predictor of the development of open angle glaucoma.11In contrast to OHTS and EGPS, we did not find any significant association between age, central corneal thickness and cup-to-disk ratio, and 5-year glaucomatous progression. Structural and functional changes are useful indicators to detect glaucoma progression, but these changes often do not happen simultaneously over a period of time.

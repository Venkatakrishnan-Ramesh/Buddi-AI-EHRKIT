Acinetobacter baumannii, as a nosocomial pathogen, causes various infections in different anatomical sites of the human body, such as skin, bloodstream, and urinary tract, with high mortality and morbidity rates (1, 2). In this context, it is worth mentioning that Meningococci group B represents the first example of the successful application of reverse vaccinology (12). In the first step, Vaxign (vaccine design webserver), a vaccine target prediction and analysis system based on the principle of reverse vaccinology, was used to select ideal putative immunogenic candidates. This database contains information from numerous sources, including experimental data, computational prediction methods, and public texts. In this part, the STRING database was used to understand the interaction of uncharacterized proteins with other A. baumannii proteins. Among the aforementioned proteins, the uncharacterized protein with the MlaD protein superfamily domain is more desirable for further investigation due to its high score of MHC-II and B-cell epitopes ratios.

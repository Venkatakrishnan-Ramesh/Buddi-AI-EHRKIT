The protocol below describes the specific steps for the induction of EAE in mice and the subsequent generation and transfer of antigen-loaded tolerogenic BM-DCs. We further provide a practical guide in how to isolate and analyze cells in secondary lymphoid organs upon BM-DC transfer, with a special focus on regulatory T-cells. CRITICAL: Successful subcutaneous injections should result in visible bolus shaped depots under the skin. with 100 μL.h.2 days later repeat the preparation and injection of the pertussis solution.2.EAE scoring.a. Starting on day 7 post EAE induction, examine mice daily for weight loss and clinical symptoms.b. Mice with this type of lesion rarely develop EAE symptoms and should be excluded from the experiment. Prepare 50 mL falcons and place a 70 μM cell strainer on them.e. Resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of erythrocyte-lysis buffer, incubate for 5 min at room temperature.o. Check cell morphology and confluency under the microscope (Figure 4A).Figure 4Quality control of antigen-loaded BM-DCs(A and B) Morphology of BM-DC cultures during differentiation (A) and quality control of MOG35–55 loaded BM-DCs by flow cytometry (B). Carefully remove 6 mL of media directly from surface.c. With the remaining media detach loosely attached cells by pipetting over the dish several times. Visually check cells (upon antigen loading DCs usually loosely attach to the dish) under the microscope.b. Transfer approximately 0.5 × 106 cells in a 96-well plate for staining. Prepare a 6-well plate, place a 70 μm strainer in each well and fill with 3 mL of sterile PBS. Centrifuge cells at 500 g for 5 min at RT.f. Prepare 1× Perm buffer by diluting 1 part 10× Perm buffer from the FoxP3 Fix/Perm Buffer Kit (see key resources table) in 9 parts ddH2O.Pause point: If cells cannot be analyzed on the same day, resuspend cells in 1× Perm Buffer and store O/N on 4°C in the dark. If mice are moved to other rooms, let them rest for at least a week prior to EAE induction.•Always freshly prepare pertussis injection solution.•Only use freshly thawed MOG35–55 aliquots and keep always on ice.•Ensure proper injection technique.

Around one-third of all proteins enter the secretory pathway through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), turning it into a crowded folding compartment. Consistent with this, the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the yeast Hrd1 complex revealed a sizable pore formed by two half-channels consisting of Hrd1 and Der1, which can accommodate a wide range of ERAD substrates, including bulky N-linked glycans (Wu et al., We, therefore, set out to characterize the unexpected role of RHBDL4 in MHC202 turnover. Hence, we presume that induction of the ER unfolded protein response (UPR) observed upon RHBDL4 ablation (Fleig et al., Consistent with such a direct role of rhomboid-catalyzed cleavage in MHC202 clearance, overexpression of RHBDL4 WT, but not its catalytically inactive serine-144-alanine mutant (RHBDL4-SA), generated an N-terminal fragment with an apparent molecular weight of 18 kDa (Figure 1E). While a certain fraction of glycosylated MHC202 was accessible to the protease, the RHBDL4-generated cleavage fragment was protected, confirming that it is generated in the ER lumen (Figure 2A). As shown for the p97 inhibitor treatment, co-expression of the RHBDL4-R308A mutant or an RHBDL4 deletion mutant lacking the entire p97-binding motif (RHBDL4ΔVBM) together with MHC202 results in the stabilization of the 18-kDa N-terminal MHC202 fragment (Figure S2F). This suggests that upon overexpression, RHBDL4 interacts with its substrates before they approach Hrd1 and thereby outcompetes the retrotranslocation of unprocessed BACE476Δ. Consistent with a scenario of dislocating shorter, RHBDL4-generated BACE cleavage fragments into the cytoplasm, an overexposed western blot reveals a 40-kDa BACE peptide in response to MG132 treatment (Figure 3B). In accordance with a functional interplay of RHBDL4 with the erlin complex, blue native polyacrylamide electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) of immunoisolated FLAG-tagged RHBDL4, both endogenously and ectopically expressed, showed distinct complexes in the range of 250 kDa to 1.2 MDa, with Erlin2 co-purifying and co-migrating with the largest assembly (Figures 5C and S5G). 527861, IMAGE:2964645), NHK (gift from R. Kopito), BACE476Δ (gift from M. Molinari), fibrinogen γ-chain wt and -R375W (gift from J. Brodsky) were generated by subcloning the respective open reading frames omitting their signal sequences into a pcDNA3-based expression vector containing a signal sequence fused to a triple FLAG tag (Fleig et al., The MHC-pTα chimera was generated by overlap extension PCR, fusing residues 22–304 of MHC-FL to the TM domain and C-terminus of pTα (residues 147–281). Subsequently, cells were further incubated and harvested 16 h later. Following digestion, peptides were extracted with 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA and concentrated in a SpeedVac vacuum centrifuge. The uninterpreted MS/MS spectra were searched against the SwissProt-human database using MaxQuant software. In MaxQuant, the ‘requantify’ and ‘match between runs’ option was utilized, the target decoy method was used to determine 1% false discovery rate. After removing cell debris, 10 μL anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads (M2, Sigma) were added. Denaturated and fully-reduced proteins were resolved on Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis onto PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, 0.45 μM pore size, Merck Millipore) using enhanced chemiluminescence to detect bound antibodies (Pierce). Quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the complementary DNA (cDNA) and the SensiFAST SYBR No-ROX Kit (Bioline) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quantitative data is shown as the mean ± SEM as indicated in the figure legends.

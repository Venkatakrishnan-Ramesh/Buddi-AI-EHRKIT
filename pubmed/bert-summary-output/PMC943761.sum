Posterior osteochondral lesions of the femoral condyle are uncommon and literature focusing on the treatment of these is limited. The amount of the femoral condyle that lies behind the maximal anterior visualization point is often underestimated. This allows for flexion and extension of the knee. Image of the left knee with the patient in the prone position. The apex of the skin flap may then be loosely tacked to the intact medial skin to provide retraction throughout the duration of the procedure (Fig 3).Fig 3Identification and neurolysis of the common peroneal nerve. Laterally, neurolysis of the common peroneal nerve is performed both proximal and distal to allow lateral retraction with minimal tension. In some cases, a lateral femoral condyle can be used for medial lesions and vice versa.3 The allograft is placed in a jig and held in place with the corresponding sizing block in the corresponding location along the posterior aspect of the femoral condyle to optimize congruency of the donor plug. Depending on the amount of exposure needed, formal dissection of the popliteal neurovascular bundle may not be necessary, thus maintaining soft tissue attachments and protection during retraction.10,13Deep dissection should also be performed bluntly with careful removal of the medial or lateral heads of the gastrocnemius to expose the posterior joint capsule.

A 67-year-old Caucasian female initially presented with a 4-day history of worsening abdominal pain due to recurrent small bowel obstruction. CT abdomen and pelvis performed at follow up demonstrated a left inferior renal pole ablation cavity without evidence of abnormal contrast enhancement in the renal mass. 6Nephroureteral stent placement with persistent extravasation (white arrow).Fig 6The nephroureteral stent was subsequently internalized by the Urology service to an indwelling ureteral stent. Based on the patient's comorbid conditions, shared decision making has been employed to discuss surgical repair of this proximal ureteral stricture and it has been decided to continue with indwelling stent changes for left kidney drainage.

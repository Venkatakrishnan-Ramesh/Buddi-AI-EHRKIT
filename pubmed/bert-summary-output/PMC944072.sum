As of May 6, 2022, there are more than 513 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, in addition to estimated 6 million deaths worldwide, with many countries reporting a new surge in cases.1 This pandemic has been known for its respiratory manifestations, but scientific literature has also reported neurological symptoms secondary to the COVID-19 infection. The alpha level was set at 0.05 for statistical significance. Furthermore, the linear regression model showed that the severity of the STESS score was directly proportional to a relationship or positively influenced by the patients’ age (p=0.004) and intra-hospital occurrence (IHO) of status epilepticus (p=0.026). Our study’s limitations include a comparatively smaller sample size, which could be due to the difficulty in classifying a refractory status epilepticus as NORSE, as multiple detailed investigations are to be run to confirm no metabolic, toxic, or structural reason for RSE in the patient. NCSE was the most prevalent kind of SE reported.

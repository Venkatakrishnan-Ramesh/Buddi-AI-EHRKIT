Massive rotator cuff tears are a common issue treated by orthopaedists.1 Defined as a rotator cuff tear involving 2 or more tendons or tear size >3Â cm, these tears are known to be bad actors for patients. The posterior portal is established first and can be used to enter the glenohumeral joint for the diagnostic portion of the arthroscopic procedure.

The tapes are placed into anterior or posterior lateral row anchors in alternating fashion to form a crossing tape construct and to compress the rotator cuff tissue into the rotator cuff footprint (Fig 10).Fig 7The arthroscopic view of the subacromial space from the posterolateral viewing portal of a right shoulder in the beach chair position.

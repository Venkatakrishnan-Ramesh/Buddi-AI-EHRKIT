Brachytherapy is commonly used for the treatment of choroidal melanoma and recently it has been explored for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration. Specialized devices for episcleral brachytherapy such as the SalutarisMD are promising additional safety and ease of performing the procedure, thus making it more practical. The dose of radiation at the interface of large choroidal vessels and medium vessels/choriocapillaris will be 8Â Gy because of the increased thickness of the large choroidal vessel layerDepiction of exponential decline in radiation dose with depth from the device.

Spiders are cosmopolitan carnivorous arthropods that play a pivotal role in maintaining the balance of ecological systems (Lee & Kim 2001) by killing 400–800 million tons of insects every year (Nyffeler & Birkhofer 2017). Pure cultures were isolated onto fresh PDA plates by hyphal tip isolation. The fungus materials, such as phialides and conidia from the asexual morph and perithecia, asci and ascospores of the sexual morph were mounted in lactophenol cotton blue solution and measured using a compound microscope (Olympus SZ31, Olympus Corporation, Japan). The p-distance between G. cebrennini and G. fusiformispora, two sister species proposed in a previous taxonomic work on Gibellula (Kuephadungphan et al. Sexual morph and Granulomanus synasexual morph not observed. Conidiophores crowded, smooth, enlarging upward into obovoid apices, (10–) 15–28(–35) × 3–4(–5) μm, bearing multiple metulae (Fig. Metulae broadly obovoid, (6.5–)7.5–9.5(–10) × (5.5–)6–6.5(–7) μm (Fig. Granulomanus synasexual morph and sexual morph not observed. Synnema arising from the posterior part of the host, cylindric, attenuated, approximately 3 mm long, 70 μm wide, white at the base, becoming brown to greenish brown upward, enlarging into inconspicuous swollen tip with acute apex (Fig. GenBank: ITS = OK040732, LSU = OK040709, TEF1 = OK040700, RPB1 = OK040718, RPB2 = OK040726. Spider completely covered by a yellowish white mycelial mat (Fig. Vesicles subglobose to globose, (9–)9.5–10.5(–11) μm diam (Fig. Typus: Thailand, Phetchabun Province, Nam Nao National Park, Headquarter Nature Trail, on Salticidae attached to the underside of a dicot leaf, 6 May 2009, K. Tasanathai, P. Srikitikulchai, S. Mongkolsamrit & T. Chohme (holotype BBH27981, culture ex-type BCC 36526). Synnema arising directly from the host abdomen, erect, cylindrical, short stipe, white, 3 mm long, composed of parallel, densely compacted hyphae (Fig. Culture characteristics: Colonies on PDA attaining a diam of 1.5 cm in 20 d at 25°C, white, velvety; reverse cream, becoming pale brown with age towards the centre (Fig. Conidia can be found singly or in chains. Considering the specimen BBH30518, its morphology is strongly reminiscent of G. pulchra by having all characters similar to G. pulchra in both shape and size (Table 3). Considering the phylogenetic placements of G. longispora, G. nigelii, G. parvula, G. pulchra and G. solita, they were distinctly placed in different relatively well-supported clades representing separate species, consistent with morphology-based classification. The Thai specimen BBH30034 was found to be morphologically similar to G. unica from Taiwan in having white mycelia, a few synnemata on the spider hosts, aspergillus-like conidiophores bearing narrowly ellipsoid conidia and a Granulomanus synasexual morph forming gibellula-like conidiophores. As the exoskeleton structure is different between insects and spiders (Evans 2013, Machałowski 2020), a focus on pathogenic fungi parasitising Myrmarachne spiders and the ant species mimicked by the spider would provide insight on whether the exoskeleton is the main factor driving the evolution of Gibellula. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Indoxysticus in Thailand. However, the identification of such a spider to the species rank without severely damaging the fungus highly requires experienced araneologists, and preferably, fresh specimens from fieldwork (Savić et al. Although this did not give much information on the species delimitation of Gibellula, several observations of the hosts indicated aspects of the interaction between spiders and Gibellula that are worth further pursuing such as behavioural modification.

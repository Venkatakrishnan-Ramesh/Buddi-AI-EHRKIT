The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is one of the most commonly injured structures of the knee.1,2 The majority of MCL injuries are treated conservatively. The vastus medialis obliquus (VMO), medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), and medial retinacula (MR) have been released posteriorly and are reflected anteriorly. The gracilis tendon (G) is left attached to the tibia and fixed proximally at the center of the femoral superficial medial collateral ligament (sMCL) insertion. The dimension of the gracilis tendon is insufficient. C) An arthroscopic view of a left knee’s medial compartment, including the medial meniscus (M) and medial tibial plateau (T), is shown. Meniscotibial gapping and a meniscocapsular rupture (C) are observed. ( An infrapatellar branch of the nervus saphenous (N) superficial to the sartorius fascia (SA) is demonstrated. A 2- to 3-cm longitudinal skin incision is made 2 cm medial to the tibial tuberosity. The gracilis tendon has been harvested proximally while the tibial insertion site is preserved. The sartorius fascia (SA) is incised and optionally armed with sutures. E) An intraoperative view of an open medial approach to the left knee is shown.

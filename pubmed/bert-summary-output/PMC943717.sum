The reliable assessment of intraocular inflammation in uveitis is essential in assessing the disease severity and response to treatment. The invasive nature of FA and the need for frequent monitoring of inflammation for proper management prompted us to find non-invasive alternative modalities of FA [9].We have often observed concurrent retinal thickening in patients with a varying degree of FA leakage. A prior study reported retinal thickening in acute anterior uveitis without FA information [10]. Whether the retinal thickening is associated with the FA leakage and whether it changes in response to therapy are not comprehensively understood. The circle crossing the vortex veins represents the equator. Spectral-domain OCT showed an intra-retinal cyst. Vascular leakage was more severe in the right eye compared to the left during the follow-ups (the second and third columns). Furthermore, ROC analysis was performed on the basis of the prediction outcome of vitreous haze using leakage scores from the GLMM model, which showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 0.91 (95% Delong’s CI 0.88–0.93) (Fig.

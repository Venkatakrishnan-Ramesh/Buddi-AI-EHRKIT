Fluorescence confocal microscopy1–3 (FCM) is a non-invasive technique widely used to observe dynamics of molecules both in vitro and in vivo.4–10 One of the advantages of FCM is its ability to detect photons at very rapid time scales, as high as ~10 MHz, limited only by photon emission and detection in a conventional single-focus confocal microscope. Consequently, the existence of more than one molecules within the confocal volume regions which we consider as the region of interest (ROI) leads to biased or altogether incorrect trajectory estimates. 1(b), and examples of photon arrival times, in each detection channel, are illustrated in Fig. 5(b) and (−1.0, 0.0, −1.5), (1.0, 0.0, −1.5), (0.0, −1.0, 1.5) and (0.0, 1.0, 1.5) in Fig. Except the case that the confocal volumes overlap substantially, these distances are within the realm of what can be achieved in current experimental setups.15,16,27–30There exists an optimal, “goldilocks”, distance between confocal volumes that allows us to minimize trajectory uncertainty. In greater detail, we start from single photon arrival times. The variables bn, can take values 0 or 1 for each model molecule.

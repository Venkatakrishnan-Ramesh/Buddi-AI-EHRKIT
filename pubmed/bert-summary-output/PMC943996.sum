Carotid artery stenosis refers to the narrowing of the major carotid arteries, which are located on each side of the neck, providing blood to the head, face, and brain. CAS failure progressed the patient's symptoms from hemiparesis to hemiplegia, and MRI demonstrated an increase in hyperintense lesions in the left hemisphere compared with the initial MRI and near occlusion in the left internal carotid artery (Fig. A) Exposure of the common carotid artery (blue arrow). ( CEA is currently considered the gold standard treatment for severe carotid stenosis, but CAS is considered a more appropriate approach to stenosis management than CEA among older adult patients [10]. Femoral access is most commonly the preferred approach for CAS, offering interventional neurologists a typically easy-to-manipulate pathway.

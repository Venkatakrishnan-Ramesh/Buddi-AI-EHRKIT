In a large cohort of unselected patients, PFA was efficacious for pulmonary vein isolation, and expressed a safety profile consistent with preferential tissue ablation. The survey data form was considered complete if at least 80% of the questions were answered. The annual number of AF ablations/centre performed annually was 704 (range 300–2200). The mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 2.1 (0–9) and mean LA diameter was 39 mm (range 16–73). This was the first ablation procedure for 93.5% of patients. In the root cause analysis, stroke was attributed to catheter exchanges and management of the 13-Fr sheath in three of seven cases; that is, despite the usage of the transparent sheath, air or thrombus was inadvertently introduced and embolized into the circulation, presumably because of insufficient aspiration and flushing with saline during catheter introductions and exchanges. As previously reported, one patient developed coronary vasospasm with associated ST segment elevation during mitral isthmus PFA, subsequently relieved with intracoronary nitroglycerin.18 This phenomenon of transient coronary spasm has been previously reported in pre-clinical studies.27 On the other hand, it should be recognized that coronary arterial injury may also occur with radiofrequency ablation at the mitral isthmus. In an unselected AF patient population in routine practice, PFA was efficacious for PVI, and expressed a safety profile consistent with preferential tissue ablation.

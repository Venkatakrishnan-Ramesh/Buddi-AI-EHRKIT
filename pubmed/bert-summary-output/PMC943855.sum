The incidences of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) have been increasing in recent decades, suggesting a role for non-genetic environmental factors (Environmental Protection Agency, 2017; Boyle et al., Then, we applied a maternal stressor of resource deprivation during the last trimester of pregnancy by limiting the bedding and nesting material (i.e., DEP + MS condition) (Bolton et al., In contrast DEP + MS treatment in TLR4 KOs resulted in a greatly exaggerated IL-6 response in pregnant dams (Figure S1I). Thus, EN-social failed to encode individual behavioral outcomes in DEP + MS males. Here, we detected atypical social preference in adult DEP + MS males after repeated presentations of a social stimulus that is not correlated with activity of brain circuits. Intriguingly this change was not due to a consistent reduction in the volume of CD68 (Figure 5H); instead, we found that there was a significant difference in the distribution of CD68 volume, with subsets of high and low CD68-expressing cells (Figures 5I and 5J), suggesting heterogeneous functional changes in male DEP + MS microglia. However, Iba1loP2ry12hi cells had significantly lower CD68 content compared with the more prevalent Iba1hiP2ry12hi microglia type (Figures 6D and 6E). Importantly, these functional differences between the three microglial subtypes are present in both CON and DEP + MS male offspring brains (Figures S6E–S6H), showing that prenatal insults do not affect the per cell functional responses. A separate cohort of WT male neonates was injected with PBS or NIF (pseudorandomized within litter) and raised into adolescence, where they were tested in a social preference task (Figure 7I). In agreement with this possibility, in the ACC, a critical brain region within this network, in DEP + MS male mice we found an early overabundance of TC synapses by the end of the first postnatal week. A separate cohort of CON and DEP+MS mice were generated to assess neurophysiological ends points with concurrent behavior (n = 13–27 animals/sex per condition group). Pup weight and toe clip identification were performed immediately after USV collection. Males and females were tested using separate testing boxes on different days. Each day mice were habituated to the testing room (1 hour) and testing chambers (5 minutes) before introducing a stimulus animal. Subsequently, mice underwent ten separate social preference test sessions, with at least one day off in between sessions, in which the test mice were allowed to freely explore the arena for ten minutes; the holding cages contained either a novel object or novel C3H target mouse. Estimating the frequency-based coherence was done using magnitude-squared coherence, defined aswhich normalizes the cross-spectral estimates by the power spectra in each region, yielding a value between 0 and 1. The objective function learned by this model iswhere K is the number of different electomes. This allows for future applications requiring real-time estimation. Choosing the supervision strength was chosen to be a value found to work well in previous analyses. Sequencing was done on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies and washed three times for 10 minutes with TBS the following morning. Images were acquired on an Olympus FV3000 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Synaptic staining was performed in two male/female littermate pairs at P6, P8, P10, P13, and P15 in WT C57BL6/J offspring to determine the normal developmental pattern. We chose to conduct our analyses in L1 because this layer contains sparse neuronal cell bodies and receives dense axonal inputs from both thalamic and neighboring regions. Maximum projections of 3 consecutive optical sections were generated using ImageJ. The Puncta Analyzer Plugin (available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6800214) for ImageJ was used to count the number of colocalized synaptic puncta. The individual analyzing the images was always blinded to the experimental conditions. Secondary Alexa-fluorophore conjugated antibodies (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were diluted (1:500) in 5% NGS in TBS with 0.5% Triton X-100, and sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature, protected from light. After incubation, sections were washed three times for 15 minutes in TBS and mounted with an in-house mounting media (20 mM Tris pH8.0, 90% Glycerol, 0.5% N-propyl gallate). Images were acquired on an Olympus FV3000 confocal laser-scanning microscopes. Huygens Professional 19.10.0p3 64b was used to deconvolve images. Briefly, mice were habituated to the testing room (1 hour) and testing chambers (5 minutes) the day before sociability testing.

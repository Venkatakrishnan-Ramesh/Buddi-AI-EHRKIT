COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) pandemic has compromised the wellbeing of millions of people worldwide. Compared to the nursing staff, more doctors were stressed out when posted for COVID-19 duties (P = 0.004) and felt that their workload has increased (P = 0.018). Majority of HCWs suggested that ensuring the adequacy of medical staff/equipment (95.7%), adequate supply of PPE kit (92.3%), and comfortable quarantine stay (92%) will help in reducing stress [Table 4]. Experience of HCWs and the problems faced while working in PPE are shown in Table 5. We also identified differences in stress and coping strategies between doctors and nursing staff, males and females and different age groups. The impact of gender in developing physical and emotional stress has been well studied. Despite individual perceptions which might be affected due to lack of adequate knowledge regarding PPE, proper training of PPE use is a must to ensure the safety of HCWs.[2627] Working in PPE comes with its unique set of problems which have been reported with varying frequencies by HCWs across the world.

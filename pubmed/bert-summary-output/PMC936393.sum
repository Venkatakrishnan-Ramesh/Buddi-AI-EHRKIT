The prolonged closures and distancing measures practiced during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have vastly altered the way of individualsâ€™ lifestyles and imposed restrictions on physical activity behavior (1). In a cross-sectional study on 1,396 patients with diabetes in Denmark, 40% reported exercising less than usual in comparison to that before the pandemic (8). Moreover, social support has been shown to decrease the negative effects of psychological distress on self-care behaviors before the pandemic (15). A high level was characterized as 7 days in the form of walking and moderate- and vigorous-intensity activities equaling 3,000 MET-minute/week. Such levels are concerning in themselves, as reducing physical activity for just a few weeks results in detrimental impacts on glycemic control (23, 24). This study is subject to several limitations. The present study also explored that insufficient physical activity was significantly associated with being female, higher age, obesity, presence of diabetes-related complications, feelings of isolation, and higher levels of distress related to diabetes.

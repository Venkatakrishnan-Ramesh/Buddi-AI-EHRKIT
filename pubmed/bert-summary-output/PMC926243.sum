In patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary hypertension are the main causes of impaired quality of life and mortality. To quantify the mean metabolic activity in each lung lobe, the volume of interest was visually assessed on the CT images by a thoracic radiologist, the mean standardized uptake value corrected for lean body mass (SULmean) being calculated using the PMOD software, version 3.609 (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). bClinical variables accumulated during disease progression. Note: SULmax and TBR values equal to zero are related to regions without any qualitatively outstanding metabolic activity for measurement. sTNFR1: soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; sTNFR2: soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2; CXCL8: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8; MIF: macrophage migration inhibitory factor; CCL2: C-C motif chemokine ligand 2; CXCL10: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10; and CXCL9: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9. The authors evaluated the neutrophilic response induced by direct instillation of endotoxin into a lung segment in healthy individuals and showed that 18F-FDG PET/CT allowed quantification of the inflammatory response. In the present study, we found high TBRs in fibrosis and GGO patterns, especially in areas of honeycombing (TBR, 4.02).

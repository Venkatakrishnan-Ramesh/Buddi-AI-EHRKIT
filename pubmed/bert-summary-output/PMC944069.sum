Heart, lung, liver and kidney transplantation remains the treatment of choice for end-stage organ failure.1 The increasing mismatch between the availability of suitable deceased donor organs and the number of potential recipients is leading to numerous deaths on transplant waiting lists. The data gathered from these interviews were analyzed following the deductive framework method15 by identifying the core statements and motivations of the interviewees and sorting them into a category system deducted from an earlier systematic review.6 This framework uses seven categories to sort the nature of statements regarding the allocation of donor organs: “Egalitarianism”, “Effectiveness/Benefit”, “Medical Urgency”, “Own fault”, “Value for society”, “Medical background” and “Sociodemographic status”, with several sub-categories. It includes a lot, and eventually I would rank it higher. It would’ve been a pity if they gave up, just because of a percentage. And I believe this to be the right thing to do. We have too few organs and therefore I would select by chance of success. Interview 01While some believed that comorbidities should be a factor to rule out people for organ transplantation, others believed that this is a difficult decision from an ethical point of view. Here similarities can be observed between the public and the patients, because members of the public act with uncertainty, not knowing if they might be in need of an organ in the future.13Contrary to their high preference for maximizing the usage of donor organs patients were aware of the ethical aspects regarding egalitarianism and generally considered everyone deserving of an organ, especially those with limited time left without one. In a situation where the aspect of urgency does not influence society’s moral compass in the allocation of deceased donor organs, patients would most likely distribute the grafts less by aspects of urgency and more by the aspects that are truly important to them: effectiveness and appreciation for the graft.

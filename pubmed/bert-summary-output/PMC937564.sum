SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) was first reported in December 2019 in China. However, the administration of these antibodies was stopped as the current Omicron VOC has markedly reduced susceptibility to both treatments (National Institutes of Health, 2021). As it targets a conserved binding site it was believed that it may retain its neutralizing against all variants but it was recently published that a 16-fold change in IC50 was observed for the Omicron BA.2 variant (Cathcart et al., Black histograms represent the background staining of 293T parental cells and gray-filled histograms represents background staining of 293T-ACE2 cells.(D) RBD-Ig staining following incubation with commercial antibody (light blue) or without antibody (dark blue). Moreover, the Fc fragment increases the half-life of the protein (Beck and Reichert, 2011). Gray histogram represent the background staining of 293T-ACE2 cells. Representative of 3 experiments.(B) RT-qPCR analysis of supernatants obtained from the infected Vero E6 cells incubated with or without increasing concentrations of hACE2.16 antibody.(C) %Neutralization was calculated using the results from B and IC50 (in ug/mL) was calculated from %Neutralization.(D) FACS analysis of Calu-3 cells stained with hACE2.16 (light blue) or with commercial anti-ACE2 antibody (dark blue). We first evaluated by flow cytometry binding of hACE2.16 to Calu-3 cells as compared to a commercial anti-ACE2 antibody (Figure 4D) and saw better binding of hACE2.16 (although we used the same concentration of both antibodies). In Calu-3 cells, infection with the Omicron subvariants BA.1 and BA.2 was most efficiently inhibited by our anti-ACE2 antibody. 2021)N/A293T-ACE2 generation: Primer RV reaction 1: GTTGGTGATGTTTCCGAGGCAGGAAGCGACCChaouat et al., ( The ACE2-Ig fusion proteins secreted to the medium were purified on HiTrap Protein G High Performance column (Cat#GE17-0405-01, GE Healthcare). In order to calibrate and determine the 50% endpoint titer (TCID50) of each variant VERO-E6 cells at a concentration of 20∗10ˆ3/well, were seeded in 96-wells plates with 10% FBS MEM-EAGLE medium, and stored at 37⁰C for 24 h. 10-fold serial dilutions of each variant were prepared using 2% FBS MEM-EAGLE medium and incubated for five days with the VERO-E6 cells.

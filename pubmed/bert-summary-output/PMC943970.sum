Asthma is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases and is characterized by chronic inflammation and airway hyperreactivity. Up to 4.4% of preschoolers and 6.4% of elementary school children are reported to have asthma. SPSS 22 software (IBM Corp., NY, USA) and Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) were employed to analyze the results and visualize the results, respectively. Healthy children: Control1, Control2, and Control3; allergic asthma: Case1, Case2, and Case3. By annotating the small RNAs according to the category, unannotated reads were the most represented type of small RNA library, followed by known miRNAs, indicating the dominance of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma (Figure 3).Figure 3The category annotation of the six libraries: (A)–(C) Healthy children and (D)–(F) Allergic asthma. Notes: (A) PCA analysis indicated significant differences; (B) Boxplot showing expression of miRNAs; (C) Number of up-/down-expressed miRNAs between allergic asthma and healthy controls. “ However, more in-depth investigations of whether differentially expressed miRNAs are drivers or outcomes of allergic asthma are needed. According to previous reports, miR-487b-3p directly inhibits the expression of interleukin-33 (IL-33), a critical proinflammatory cytokine known to mediate allergic airway inflammation, but the finding that the expression levels of miR-487b-3p are similar between control mice and OVA-challenged wild-type mice is difficult to understand.21 Our study may provide evidence that miR-487b-3p expression is reduced in the serum of patients with allergic asthma.

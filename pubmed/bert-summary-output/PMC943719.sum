First-line treatment of inflammation of the posterior segment due to non-infectious uveitis and associated macular edema mainly relies on local administration of corticosteroids. No treatment-related deaths were reported during the study, and 3 (6.8%) of the 44 patients who experienced  at least one AE discontinued treatment because of AEs. N = total number of patients with data available at the indicated time point. In addition, the proportion of patients previously treated with DEX was remarkably larger in the LOUVRE study (54.7%) than the CONSTANCE study (25.2% [20]), which is likely because the CONSTANCE study was initiated in March 2012 [20] and thus sooner after European Union approval of DEX for inflammation of the posterior segment due to non-infectious uveitis (April 2011 [21]) than the LOUVRE 2 study. Although cataract and ocular hypertension were reported following DEX treatment, both AEs were manageable [24].The AEs recorded as potentially treatment related during the present study were in line with the prescribing information for DEX [10, 11] and not unexpected, except the case of macular fibrosis (ongoing at study end). It is also worth noting that, although the study protocol originally called for recruitment of at most 20 patients per center, a few centers ultimately contributed more than 20 patients to the study, because of the low prevalence/incidence of non-infectious uveitis of the posterior segment in general and consequent difficulty in recruiting patients with the disease (245 enrolled vs. 400 planned).

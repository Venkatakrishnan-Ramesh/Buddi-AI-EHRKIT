In 1999, the Institute of Medicine (IOM, now National Academy of Medicine/NAM) published To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System.1 One of the IOM/NAM's central messages was that reporting safety events is the foundation for understanding systemic risk and improving patient safety.2 In keeping with the safety advancements made in other high-risk industries such as aviation, the IOM/NAM report specifically recommended that healthcare organizations improve the reporting of patient safety events by submitting “incident reports” or “safety reports. The root causes of this low rate of reporting by pathology trainees are unknown and should be investigated further. Studies have shown, however, that increased trainee exposure to quality and safety concepts, even in the form of simulation, increases the rate of trainee willingness to report safety events.24 Pathology education and quality and safety leaders would be well-advised to examine interventions made in other specialties to increase trainee reporting and modify those interventions for pathology training programs.

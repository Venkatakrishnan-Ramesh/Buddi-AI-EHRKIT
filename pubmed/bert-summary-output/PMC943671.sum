Neurologic injury is generally a late side effect of radiation therapy (RT), occurring months after the treatment has occurred. One rat had an unexpected delay after injection so it was excluded from the volume analysis. The 140 Gy mice showed the tightest volume distribution and earliest time point with a visible lesion on Gd-MRI, so the images of this group at the 2-week time point were chosen to most accurately represent the beam location. B, Regions of interest (ROIs) were hand-drawn around the region of hyperintensity present in only 1 hemisphere. Total distance is the Euclidean norm of the points. The lesion volumes were tracked over time in the 100 and 140 Gy mice and showed growth over 13 weeks after treatment. To overcome this disadvantage, the LINAC, which is more commonly used in clinics, has been applied in rats.30,31 This model uses a single beam delivery but suffers toxicity such as moist desquamation dermatitis from a 60 Gy treatment.20 This may limit the maximum deliverable dose using a single beam, which is undesirable when studying radionecrosis induced by higher doses such as 140 Gy used in the SRS treatment of patients with tremors.8,20 Moreover, rats are relatively more expensive and less used than mouse models particularly in cancer research. Small animal irradiators with onboard imaging allow for highly accurate target localization and radiation delivery.34 However, these machines generally do not fully replicate human therapies, for example, differing in dose rate and beam quality.35 Furthermore, mice are sensitive to long durations of anesthesia,33 so the low-dose rate of small animal irradiators may endanger the animals in the case of high-dose therapies.

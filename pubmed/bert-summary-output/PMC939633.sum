With the growing epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most common chronic liver diseases worldwide.1,2 It is reported that the global prevalence of NAFLD is approximately 25%, and the prevalence in the USA has risen from 20.0% to 31.9% in the past 3 decades.3,4 There is a similar estimated prevalence of 29.62% in Asia.5 NAFLD may progress through various fibrosis stages and has the potential to develop into cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. MAFLD will be diagnosed if the patient has hepatic steatosis and any of the following three conditions: overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or at least two metabolic abnormalities in nonobese individuals.21 Considering the significant difference between MAFLD and NAFLD, the applicability of traditional noninvasive fibrosis scores requires re-evaluation. ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; BMI, body mass index; hs-CRP, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; GGT, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HOMA-IR, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; TBIL, total bilirubin. Best cutoff value is presented in italic font. The positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of the four models with the new thresholds ranged from 1.39–2.37 and 0.64–0.81, and diagnostic odds ratios did not exceed 3.5 (Table 2).

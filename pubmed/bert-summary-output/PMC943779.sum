A growing body of evidence has shown numerous associations, some of them bidirectional, between oral and systemic diseases that are prevalent in older adults such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and respiratory diseases.1,2Ideally at any age, oral diseases are prevented or treated at an early stage, but this becomes more critical as dependency increases due to either systemic illness or very advanced age. More information about the economic impacts of unmet dental needs in adults 65 years and older on individual out-of-pocket and private insurance spending, the costs to public health for those without means, and the loss of productivity in the workplace for those who continue to work are needed to help shape policy and programmes that reduce total expenditures for oral health care by addressing those unmet needs. Inclusion of a universal dental benefit in Medicare for all enrollees would raise awareness of the importance of oral health to general health and pave the way for meaningful integration of dental and medical care to improve the health and well-being of older adults in the United States.45Financing oral health care in Europe differs amongst different countries, but in most cases direct patient payments are more common than in general health care. For example, stomatitis can disturb food intake, leading to a weakened physical condition. As part of this system, health education materials designed to prevent metabolic syndrome (diabetes, obesity, and heart disease), as well as related risk factors such as periodontal disease and chewing function decline, have been developed. In 2018, question items regarding subjective chewing function were added because a decline in chewing function is indicative of dental disease and tooth loss. Oral disease prevention and treatment at early stages of oral disease can support systemic health, preserve private and public resources, and maintain quality of life and well-being for older adults at every stage of life.

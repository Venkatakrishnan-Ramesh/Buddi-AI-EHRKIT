Allopregnanolone concentration was measured in breast milk and plasma.Secondary endpoints were allopregnanolone levels in plasma after a 60-h brexanolone infusion and the safety and tolerability of a 60-h brexanolone infusion in healthy lactating women.Pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma brexanolone concentrations by model-independent methods (non-compartmental analysis) included area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) from time 0–60 h (AUC0–60), AUC from time 0–infinity (AUC0–∞), AUC from time 24–56 h (AUC24–56) during the infusion plateau, maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax), time to peak plasma concentration (tmax), steady-state drug concentration in plasma during constant-rate infusion (Css), clearance (CL), and average drug concentration in plasma at steady state during the infusion plateau (Cavg).1Mean allopregnanolone concentration in plasma.Mean allopregnanolone concentration in plasma.2Allopregnanolone concentration in breast milk for each participant.Allopregnanolone concentration in breast milk for each participant.The geometric mean (95% CI) Cmax was 89.7 ng/mL (74.2–108.4), tmax was 47.8 h (47.8–55.8), AUC0-60 was 3358.4 ng∙h/mL (2998.6–3761.4), and elimination half-life (t½) was 11.3 h (9.8–13.1; Table 3).Table 3Plasma PK parameters for the 547-CLP-108 study (non-compartmental analysis, N = 11)PK parametersGeometric mean95% confidence intervalCmax, ng/mL89.7(74.2–108.4)tmax, h47.8(47.8–55.8)Cavg, ng/mL70.6(61.9–80.5)Css, ng/mL80.1(70.9–90.4)AUC0–60, ng·h/mL3358.4(2998.6–3761.4)AUC24–56, ng·h/mL2257.9(1979.5–2575.5)AUC0–t, ng·h/mL3557.8(3177.6–3983.4)AUC0–∞, ng·h/mL3736.5(3309.1–4219.1)tlast, h72.0(72.0–72.0)R2 adjusted0.9(0.9–1.0)t½, h11.3(9.8–13.1)λZ, 1/h0.06(0.05–0.07)CL, L/h87.5(78.8–97.2)VZ, L1431.2(1224.8–1672.3)AUC0–60 area under the concentration–time curve from time 0 to 60 h, AUC24–56 from 24 to 56 h, AUC0–t AUC from time 0 to last measurable concentration, AUCo–∞ from time 0 to infinity, Cavg average plasma concentration from 24 to 56 h, Cmax maximum (peak) plasma concentration, Css concentration in plasma at steady state, CL total body clearance of drug from plasma, λz individual estimate of the terminal elimination rate constant, PK pharmacokinetics, R2 coefficient of determination, t½ elimination half-life, tlast time of last measurable plasma concentration, tmax time to peak plasma concentration, Vz volume of distribution.AUC0–60 area under the concentration–time curve from time 0 to 60 h, AUC24–56 from 24 to 56 h, AUC0–t AUC from time 0 to last measurable concentration, AUCo–∞ from time 0 to infinity, Cavg average plasma concentration from 24 to 56 h, Cmax maximum (peak) plasma concentration, Css concentration in plasma at steady state, CL total body clearance of drug from plasma, λz individual estimate of the terminal elimination rate constant, PK pharmacokinetics, R2 coefficient of determination, t½ elimination half-life, tlast time of last measurable plasma concentration, tmax time to peak plasma concentration, Vz volume of distribution.3A PopPK model of breast milk and plasma allopregnanolone levels.A PopPK model of breast milk and plasma allopregnanolone levels.a Plasma at the 60 µg/kg/h infusion rate, b plasma at the 90 µg/kg/h infusion rate, c breast milk at the 60 µg/kg/h infusion rate, and d breast milk at the 90 µg/kg/h infusion rate.a Plasma at the 60 µg/kg/h infusion rate, b plasma at the 90 µg/kg/h infusion rate, c breast milk at the 60 µg/kg/h infusion rate, and d breast milk at the 90 µg/kg/h infusion rate.

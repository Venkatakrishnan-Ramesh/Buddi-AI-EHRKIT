We hypothesize that 1) within each clade, bee mimics will exhibit lower model classification accuracy compared to their non-mimic counterparts, and 2) wasp mimics will exhibit intermediate accuracy; furthermore, 3) bee mimics that are believed to exploit aggressive mimicry toward bees will exhibit better mimicry—as defined by lower classification accuracy—compared to bee mimics that employ only defensive mimicry.The metric we used to evaluate our models is classification accuracy, defined as the percentage of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions:(Equation 1)accuracy=100×(Truepositive+Truenegative)(Truepositive+Truenegative+Falsepositive+Falsenegative)Table 1Insect orders and non-bee image

accurately identifies these insects as non-bumble bee.Lastly, one limitation of our bumble bee model is that all of the training images were of bees (bumble bees and non-bumble bee bees), with no training images of non-bees.

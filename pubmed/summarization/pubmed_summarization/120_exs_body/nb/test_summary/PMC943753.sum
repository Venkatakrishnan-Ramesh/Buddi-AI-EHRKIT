Careful management of the subscapularis tendon is crucial in anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) because of its critical role in preserving anterior stability, postoperative function, and survival of the glenoid component.1 There are multiple techniques commonly employed to mobilize the subscapularis tendon during anatomic TSA through a deltopectoral approach, including subscapularis tenotomy, subscapularis peel, or lesser tuberosity osteotomy (LTO).2, 3, 4 LTO has multiple potential benefits, including bone-to-bone healing of the repair, a bony fragment that decreases pull-through of the sutures, easy postoperative repair surveillance with radiographs, and decreasing the anterior–posterior dimension of the humerus, which may aid in glenoid exposure.5 Stemless and mini-stem arthroplasty was initially felt to be a contraindication to this technique, but this been shown not to be the case.6,7 Despite these theoretical benefits and a host of retrospective and case–control data,2,8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 prospective, Level I studies have shown no difference compared with subscapularis peel or tenotomy.4,5,14,15.(A) A plane is developed between the subscapularis and anterior capsule.(A) A plane is developed between the subscapularis and anterior capsule.In the postoperative period, patients should not begin active internal rotation until the osteotomy has healed at 6 weeks, as this can damage LTO repair and result in subscapularis failure.Table 1Pearls and PitfallsPearls•With the arm in external rotation and slight abduction, the cleft between the lesser tuberosity and humeral head osteophytes must be palpated beneath the subscapularis tendon to determine the site of the LTO with a total of 2 cm bone block removed•During the capsulectomy procedure, electrocautery should be followed along the humeral shaft rather than following the osteophytes to avoid injury of the axillary nerve•Axillary nerve should be palpated several times during the capsulectomy and always protected with blunt retractors to avoid injury•Curved scissors should be used to assist in developing the plane between the capsule and subscapularis•A Cobb elevator can be useful in creating tension between the capsular and subscapularis plane.•Release and excise the capsule from the subscapularis before performing the humeral head cutPitfalls•Creating an LTO that is too large increases the risk of fracture and a small LTO can inhibit sufficient bone-to-bone healing resulting in failure•Injury to the axillary nerve if not continuously protected or in the incorrect plane•Beginning active internal rotation too early in the postoperative period can damage the LTO repair and result in subscapularis failureLTO, lesser tuberosity osteotomy.Furthermore, there is a risk of axillary nerve injury if not adequately protected during the entirety of the capsulectomy procedure.Table 2Advantages and LimitationsAdvantages•LTO allows for more substantial bone-to-bone healing with no violation of the subscapularis tendon•LTO allows for a repair technique that mimics the native anatomy•LTO repair can be closely monitored radiographically during the perioperative healing process•Capsulectomy procedure helps with subscapularis excursion and optimizes soft-tissue balance•Capsulectomy procedure improves glenoid exposure and allows for easier glenoid component insertion by removing thickened diseased tissueLimitations•LTO is associated with a small risk of non-union, resorption of the tuberosity fragment, and intraoperative fracture•Due to the significant capsular release along the humeral head, the axillary nerve is at risk of injury with extensive dissectionLTO, lesser tuberosity osteotomy.

We sought to determine the frequency and predictors of death or unplanned readmission after a COVID-19 hospital discharge.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all adults (≥ 18 yr) who were discharged alive from hospital after a nonpsychiatric, nonobstetric, acute care admission for COVID-19 between Jan. 1, 2020, and Sept. 30, 2021, in Alberta and Ontario.Of 843 737 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction during the study period, 46 412 (5.5%) were adults admitted to hospital within 14 days of their positive test.Studies of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 have reported 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission rates between 3.6% and 10.4%, and few evaluated predictors.2–12 Moreover, all studies focused on patients admitted to hospital during the first year of the pandemic, many captured readmissions only if at the same hospital as the index admission, most did not account for the competing risk of outpatient death, and some excluded events in the first 7 days after discharge.2–12 These are substantial weaknesses, since as many as one-quarter of readmissions occur at different hospitals than the index admission13 and 7%–10% of COVID-19 survivors die within 2 months after discharge.14,15.In the pre-COVID-19 era, hospital readmissions were recognized to be common and costly.16 Knowing the readmission rate and resource implications for patients who have been discharged after a hospital admission for COVID-19 is important for health system resource planners as health care systems deal with subsequent waves of the pandemic, particularly with the increasing recognition of substantial postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.17 Identifying risk factors for early readmission or death is important for both the in-hospital clinical team and the primary care physician who reassumes care after discharge, as well as for transition coordinators deciding which patients may benefit from additional resources at discharge, to optimize outcomes.We identified comorbidities for each patient using previously validated case definitions based on ICD-10 codes for the index hospital admission and any admissions in the year before their index admission.21,22 Other nonclinical covariates included hospital type (teaching v. nonteaching), patient residence (rural v. urban, as defined by the Canadian Census), socioeconomic status (defined using the Pampalon Deprivation Index in Alberta and the Ontario Marginalization Index in Ontario), residence in a long-term care facility, number of urgent hospital admissions in the previous 12 months, number of ED visits in the previous 6 months, LACE score (length of stay, acuity, Charlson Comorbidity Index and number of ED visits in previous 6 months),23 Charlson Comorbidity Index score and day of discharge since these have been shown to influence readmission rates in other studies.24,25.Fixed-effects adjustment variables included age, sex, rural residence status, deprivation index quintiles, Charlson score, number of nonelective hospital admissions in the previous 12 months, number of ED visits in the previous 6 months, index discharge disposition location (i.e., home with or without home care, or to long-term care or nursing facility), length of index admission (entered into the model as < 6 d v. ≥ 6 d, with the cutpoint determined from a restricted cubic spline function with 5 knots), admission to the intensive care unit during the index hospital admission, discharge on a weekend or holiday, hospital type (teaching v. nonteaching), SARS-CoV-2 strain and vaccination status.It is also consistent with previous work on readmission risk factors after nonobstetric, nonpsychiatric hospitalizations in the pre-COVID-19 era.16,21,25 However, we found that, although in-hospital death was more likely and lengths of hospital stays were longer with SARS-CoV-2 than historical norms for other respiratory tract infections,28–30 postdischarge event rates were similar after admissions for COVID-19 as with other medical causes of hospital admission before the pandemic in both provinces.23,25,29–32 This mirrors data from England where the median length of stay for COVID-19 was 7 days (compared with 8 d in our study) and the risk of 6-month readmission or death was similar for hospital admission for COVID-19 in 2020 as it was for admissions for influenza in 2017–2019 (34.8% v. 37.8%, adjusted hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91–0.98).12 Although outcome rates were similar in Alberta and Ontario, the discrimination performance of the LACE score for post-discharge readmission or death23 was suboptimal in our study population; including sex, discharge locale and socioeconomic status in the model improved prediction performance (akin to previous studies of the LACE+ model).25.

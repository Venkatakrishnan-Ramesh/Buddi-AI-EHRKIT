Corneal endothelial cells play a critical role in the preservation of corneal deturgescence and transparency through barrier function and active ion transport processes.1 Corneal endothelial damage may result from surgical injury, trauma, ocular hypertension, anterior uveitis, and heritable conditions, such as endothelial dystrophies.2 Fuchs’ endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is the most common endothelial dystrophy in humans, affecting up to 4% of the US population over 40 years of age.3 Patients with FECD exhibit progressive loss of corneal endothelial cells, resulting in guttae in early stages and edema, scarring, and significant visual impairment once a critically low endothelial cell density (ECD) is reached.2.Corneal endothelial degeneration in human patients is frequently treated with penetrating or lamellar corneal transplantation.4,5 In recent years, graft-sparing techniques, such as Descemet's stripping only (DSO), and cell-based therapies have gained considerable attention in the treatment of FECD in a subset of patients.6–10 The use of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitors, such as ripasudil, a ROCK inhibitor approved for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension in Japan, may expand the role of graft-sparing techniques in the treatment of corneal endothelial degeneration.Rho kinase is a downstream effector of Rho guanosine triphosphate that modulates cell adhesion, cell morphology, extracellular matrix organization, membrane permeability, actomyosin contractility, and DNA synthesis.11–16 Various ROCK inhibitors, including ripasudil and Y-27632, have been shown in vitro and in ex vivo tissue models to promote corneal endothelial cell proliferation and adhesion17,18 and to inhibit apoptosis of corneal endothelial cells.17–19 In vivo studies using rabbit, canine, and non-human primate corneal wound models have demonstrated that ROCK inhibitors enhance corneal endothelial wound healing, improve corneal transparency, and reduce corneal thickness after injury.17,20,21.It has been established as a spontaneous model for FECD based on the presumed heritability and shared clinical and histologic features.24,25 Both dogs and humans can also experience age-related degeneration of the corneal endothelium due to the limited proliferative capacity of corneal endothelial cells.26–28 Dogs have been shown to have an endothelial cell proliferative capacity intermediate between non-human primates and rabbits based on corneal wound healing models,20,29,30 making dogs an appropriate model for assessing therapies for corneal endothelial diseases.Before and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after initiating treatment with ripasudil, all eyes underwent complete ophthalmic examination, including digital slit-lamp biomicroscopy (Imaging Module IM 900; Haag Streit, Koeniz, Switzerland), handheld slit-lamp biomicroscopy (SL-15; Kowa American Corporation, Torrance, CA), binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy (Keeler Instruments Inc., Broomall, PA) using a 28 diopter (D) indirect lens (Volk Optical, Inc., Mentor, OH), and Schirmer tear-test 1 (STT1; Intervet, Inc., Summit, NJ).Adverse events identified on examination were recorded and described using the semiquantitative preclinical ocular toxicology scoring (SPOTS) system.31 Animals were placed in sternal recumbency, and FD-OCT (RTVue 100, software version 6.1, 26000 A scan/sec, 5-µm axial resolution, 840-nm superluminescent diode, Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA) and IVCM (ConfoScan 4 Nidek Technologies, Gamagori, Japan; HRT3 Heidelberg Engineering, Franklin, MA) of the central cornea were performed using previously described methods.24,25,32 Intravenous sedation was administered as needed for imaging.Whereas statistically significant progression of central corneal thickness was found with USP measurements, a previous study demonstrated that manual FD-OCT measurements demonstrate less variability than USP measurements of corneal thickness in eyes with corneal disease.36 Therefore, the relevance of the statistically significant difference in corneal thickness by USP when no significant differences were identified using FD-OCT should not be overstated.documented disease progression in CED-affected dogs based on the extent and severity of corneal edema over time.34 Using the same progression criteria applied to eyes in the current study, we demonstrated a statistically significant difference in corneal edema progression with and without ripasudil therapy.However, ROCK inhibitors have more routinely been used as an adjunctive or rescue therapy after surgical disruption of the corneal DM-endothelium complex through DSO in human patients.6,7 Previous studies have shown favorable responses to ripasudil following DSO with improved endothelial cell densities in ripasudil-treated eyes compared to those who underwent DSO without ripasudil therapy.7,37,38 Excision of abnormal endothelial cells and the associated Descemet's membrane is thought to allow for peripheral endothelial cells to proliferate and migrate to restore corneal deturgescence.6,38,39 Alleviation of contact-inhibition through physical denudation of the corneal endothelium may enhance the benefit of ROCK inhibition.The clinical benefit observed with ripasudil without endothelial disruption in the current study may be related to reduction of endothelial cell apoptosis or improved endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion following loss of endothelial cells, as have been seen in vitro and in ex vivo tissue models.17–19 Future studies may investigate the use of ROCK inhibitors in PCED-affected dogs following corneal endothelial denudation with or without the injection of cultured endothelial cells.Topical ripasudil was well-tolerated in PCED-affected dogs with conjunctival hyperemia being the most common adverse event observed, consistent with previous tolerability studies.41,42 An additional adverse event was the development of reticular bullous epithelial edema, which has also been reported in a series of human patients receiving the topical ROCK inhibitor netarsudil.43,44 However, unlike in human patients, the reticular bullous epithelial edema was transient in these dogs and resolved without discontinuation of ripasudil as this change was appreciated at some visits but not all.The cause of reticular bullous epithelial edema remains unknown but may involve ROCK-inhibitor induced disruption of actin cytoskeleton organization and tight junctions of corneal epithelial cells.44 The disappearance of the bullae without cessation of ripasudil may indicate that the edema was present as a result of the underlying disease rather than an adverse drug event, that the adverse event was truly transient or occurred only shortly after administration, or that topical hypertonic saline ointment may have aided in resolution of the bullae.

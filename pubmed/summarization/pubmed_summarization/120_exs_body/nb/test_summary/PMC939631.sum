The children were between 1 month and 16 years of age.On April 5, 2022, the United Kingdom (UK) International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of 10 cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in previously healthy children under 10 years of age in Scotland.On May 6, 2022, the UK published technical briefing, “Investigation into acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children in England," that described 163 cases, 11 of which required liver transplantation and no deaths at that time.2 From that moment on, cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown origin in children began to be reported in several countries (Fig.The UK has established a case definition and has developed a survey for the investigation of cases that meet the definition, which have been shared by the IHR with the rest of the countries.12 The provisional confirmed case definition is a person presenting, after January 1, 2022 with an acute hepatitis which was not caused by hepatitis A–E viruses, or an expected presentation of metabolic, inherited or genetic, congenital or mechanical cause with serum transaminases >500 IU/L (AST or ALT), and ≤10 years of age.A possible case definition is a person presenting with acute hepatitis after January 1, 2022 with acute hepatitis not caused by hepatitis A–E viruses, or an expected presentation of metabolic, inherited, or genetic, congenital or mechanical cause with serum transaminases >500 IU/L (AST or ALT), who is 11–15 years of age.As far as what we know today about liver biopsies and treatment of some of the children who have suffered from severe acute hepatitis, we have two studies conducted in Israel and in the UK.13,14 In the study carried out in Israel, the authors reported five pediatric patients who recovered from COVID-19 and later presented with liver injury.(3) A new adenovirus variant, with or without the contribution of a cofactor; (4) A post-infectious SARS-CoV-2 syndrome (including a restricted effect of Omicron); (5) Drug, toxin or environmental exposure; (6) A new pathogen acting alone or as a coinfection; (7) A new variant of SARS-CoV-2; or (8) SARS-CoV-2 envelope glycoprotein spike acting as a superantigen.In some cases, adenoviruses have been implicated in hepatitis in immunocompromised children and adults, and exceptionally in healthy individuals.15–17 In addition, not all children have tested positive for adenovirus, and those who did test positive have often tested positive in only whole blood, and at very low concentrations, with the virus not being detected in liver and plasma samples.Another observation that tends to confirm this hypothesis is the presence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 of a sequence not present in other coronaviruses and resembling another sequence in Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B that produces toxic shock syndrome.22 It also acts as a superantigen, binding to major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells and to the Vβ chains of the specific T-cell receptor (TCR).23 The interaction results in the activation of a large proportion (up to 30%) of T cells and the massive release of proinflammatory cytokines24 that trigger a rapid and potent inflammatory reaction.It has been shown in mice that an adenovirus infection generates hypersensitivity against enterotoxin B.23 For those reasons, Brodin and Arditi suggest that children with acute hepatitis be investigated for SARS-CoV-2 persistence in stool, T-cell receptor skewing, and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) upregulation, because that would provide evidence of a SARS-CoV-2 superantigen mechanism in an adenovirus-41F-sensitized host.18.

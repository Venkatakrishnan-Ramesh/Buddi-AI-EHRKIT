The study included 746 children, of whom 30% were infected with parasites.The target population of this study was the children under 10 years of age living in the 14 neighborhoods previously selected.In each registered family, all children under 10 years of age were included in the study.The population was young in accordance with the whole population of Madagascar, and only 22.9% of the families didn't have children under 5 years of age.The average numbers of children under 10 years of age and under 5 years of age were 2.8 (SD 1.5) and 1.7 (SD 0.8) respectively.Men were mostly artisans (20.4%) or traders (18.6%).Table 2Description of the population studied (variable distribution with the number of persons or household presenting each parameter).Table 2Family descriptionModalitiesNumber (%)Household descriptionModalitiesNumber (%)Educational level (Mother)No education182 (24.4%)Source of waterstandpipe549 (73.6%)Primary4 (0.54%)tap182 (24.4%)Secondary466 (62.4%)bottle5 (0.67%)High school53 (7.1%)tap + bottle2 (0.27%)missing data41 (5.5%)well3 (0.4%)Mother employmentArtisan27 (3.6%)standpipe + bottle4 (0.54%)merchant97 (13%)missing data1 (0.13%)farmer12 (1.6%)Treatment of waterboiling1 (0.13%)at home385 (51.6%)nothing505 (67.69%)teacher14 (1.9%)don't know2 (0.27%)hotel26 (3.5%)some time116 (15.55%)student2 (0.27%)often120 (16.1%)trader16 (2.14%)missing data2 (0.27%)employee18 (2.4%)retired1 (0.13%)Type of heaterwood46 (6.17%)nurse3 (0.4%)wood + coal13 (1.74%)missing data10 (1.34%)coal660 (88.47%)Father employmentArtisan152 (20.38%)coal + Gaz13 (1.74%)merchant92 (12.33%)electricity5 (0.67%)grower18 (2.4%)electricity + coal1 (0.13%)teacher9 (1.2%)gas6 (0.8%)pupil6 (0.8%)missing data2 (0.27%)hotel12 (1.6%)Type of lightingcandle32 (4.3%)trader139 (18.6%)electricity611 (81.9%)fisherman72 (9.65%)electricity and petrol3 (0.4%)retired10 (1.34%)petrol96 (12.9%)employee89 (11.9%)missing data4 (0.54%)nurse3 (0.4%)Type of wallsconcrete89 (11.9%)missing data139 (18.6%)concrete + metal sheet4 (0.53%)Owning a TVYes549 (73.59%)wood55 (7.37%)No194 (26.01%)wood + metal sheet3 (0.4%)missing data3 (0.4%)cob12 (1.6%)Owning a radioYes448 (60%)brick1 (0.13%)No293 (39.28%)concrete + brick42 (5.6%)missing data5 (0.67%)brick + metal sheet5 (0.67%)Owning a cell phoneYes627 (84%)stone8 (1.07%)No117 (15.68%)metal sheet526 (70.5%)missing data2 (0.27%)missing data1 (0.13%)Owning a fridgeYes104 (13.9%)Type of floorwood21 (2.82%)No621 (83.24%)tilling9 (1.2%)missing data21 (2.8%)Cement653 (87.5%)Owning a carYes33 (4.4%)bare ground62 (8.3%)No710 (95.17%)missing data1 (0.13%)missing data3 (0.4%)Type of roofconcrete3 (0.4%)Owning a bicycleYes146 (19.57%)wood3 (0.42%)No597 (80%)straw75 (6.03%)missing data3 (0.4%)straw + metal sheet3 (0.40%)Owning a motoYes83 (11.13%)metal sheet652 (87%)No661 (88.6%)tiles9 (87.4%)missing data2 (0.27%)missing data1 (0.13%)inhouse showerYes675 (90.5%)Inhouse sanitationYes618 (82.8%)No68 (9.12%)No125 (16.7%)missing data3 (0.4%)missing data3 (0.4%).The educational level of mothers had a major impact on the prevalence of parasites in children.The age of the child (considered as the square of age in year) was a risk factor for contamination.The risk also increased for children with mother without education.This prevalence of Giardia decreased when the mother's level of education was high.The prevalence of Giardia parasite was also higher in the very poor and poor quintiles of households.

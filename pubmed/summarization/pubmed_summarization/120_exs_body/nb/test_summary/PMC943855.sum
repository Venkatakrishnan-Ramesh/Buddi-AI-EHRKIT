Behavior was collected as described below at P7, P8, P9, P30, and in adult animals (~P60-P100).The recording bundles designed to target basolateral and central amygdala (AMY), medial dorsal thalamus (MD), nucleus accumbens core and shell (NAc), VTA, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and VHip were centered based on stereotaxic coordinates measured from bregma (Amy: −1.4 mm AP, 2.9 mm ML, −3.85 mm DV from the dura; MD: −1.5 8 mm AP, 0.3 mm ML, −2.88 mm DV from the dura; VTA: −3.5 mm AP, ±0.25 mm ML, −4.25 mm DV from the dura; VHip: −3.3 mm AP, 3.0 mm ML, −3.75 mm DV from the dura; mPFC: 1.62 mm AP, ±0.25 mm ML, 2.25 mm DV from the dura; NAc: 1.3 mm AP, 2.25 mm ML, −4.1 mm DV from the dura, implanted at an angle of 22.1°).Synaptic staining was performed at P8, P15, and P100 in male and female offspring for CON and DEP+MS conditions.Microglia cell counts of Iba1 and/or P2ry12 positive cells were performed in male and female CON and DEP+MS offspring at P8, P15, and P25.Synaptic staining was performed at P8, P15, and P100 in male and female offspring for CON and DEP+MS conditions.

In addition, as the tear size grows, surgeons are more likely to use more implants to address the tear, which leads to increased costs.5 In this Technical Note, we describe a technique for repair of a massive rotator cuff tear using a transosseous equivalent, double-row construct with a single medial-row anchor, 5 free FiberTape sutures, and 2 preloaded FiberWire sutures.The tapes are placed into anterior or posterior lateral row anchors in alternating fashion to form a crossing tape construct and to compress the rotator cuff tissue into the rotator cuff footprint (Fig 10).Fig 7The arthroscopic view of the subacromial space from the posterolateral viewing portal of a right shoulder in the beach chair position.Massive rotator cuff tears make up to 40% of all rotator cuff tears.1 They are more likely to be significantly debilitating to patients and historically were thought to have universally poor outcomes following repair, although more recent literature has shown promising results.2 The principles of the rotator cuff repair are described by Azar et al.6 and describe the importance of the subacromial decompression, maintaining the deltoid origin, mobilizing torn tendons potentially with an interval slide, repairing the tendon to bone, and following a supervised and staged rehab protocol.The double-row, transosseous-equivalent construct has shown improved biomechanical strength over that of the single-row repair,4 but the double-row repair has added cost of more anchors, increases operating room time, and is more technically demanding.5 Recent systematic reviews and metanalysis of biomechanical literature have shown that factors positively influencing the strength of a repair are the number of sutures used in a repair, use of larger diameter sutures, and use of mattress stitches.7 We believe the aforementioned technique addresses some of the shortcomings of the double-row repair while incorporating all 3 components found in this review to positively influence the strength of the repair.It can result in pullout of the medial anchor and failure of the construct.An anterior interval slide can be used to allow the cuff to reduce closer to the footprintIf a Lafosse grade 4 or 5 subscapularis tear is present, then repair of the subscapularis must be performed as well.Placing the posterior arthroscopic portal more lateral and superior than a standard posterior arthroscopic portal can improve visualization.Table 3Advantages and DisadvantagesAdvantagesDisadvantagesLower cost of procedureBiceps tendon incorporation can theoretically lead to increased stiffness postoperativelyReduction in procedure timeMedial-row fixation is dependent on a single anchorIncorporating the biceps tendon results in more resistance to superior humeral head migration.

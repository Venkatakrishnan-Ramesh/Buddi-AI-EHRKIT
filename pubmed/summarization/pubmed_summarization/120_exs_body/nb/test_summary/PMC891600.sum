To separate the protein-coding activity from the base-pairing activities of spf, we constructed an overexpression plasmid with the tac promoter on pKK177-3, driving expression of only the spfP ORF, in which the sequence of two of the Spot 42 base-pairing regions were recoded to eliminate base pairing potential while maintaining the amino acid sequence of SpfP (pKK–SpfP-recoded) (Fig.(B) Immunoblotting analysis of GalM–SPA levels in Δspf Δcrp strains with chromosomal galM-SPA::kan (GSO1134) transformed with pKK, pKK–SpfP-recoded, or pKK–SpfP-recodedSTOP and pACYC-crpL51M, pACYC-crpL62F, pACYC-crpS84R, or pACYC-crpS180Y grown in M63 galactose to an OD600 of ∼0.5.We also examined the ability of the L51M, L62F, S84R, and S180Y mutants to block the inhibitory effect of SpfP on GalM–SPA expression by transforming a galM-SPA Δcrp Δspf strain carrying pKK, pKK–SpfP-recoded, or pKK–SpfP-recodedSTOP with the plasmids expressing crp or one of the four mutants (Fig.(C) Immunoblotting analysis of GalK–HA-His6 levels in galK-HA-His6::kan (GSO1057), Δspf galK-HA-His6::kan (GSO1060), spf-recoded galK-HA-His6::kan (GSO1077), or spfSTOP::kan. galK-HA-His6 (GSO1075) grown in M63 glucose to an OD600 of ∼0.4 at 30 °C (Left) or 42 °C (Right).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global public health concern and is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response that can lead to a large variety of clinical manifestations such as respiratory distress, sepsis, coagulopathy, and death.Several mechanisms attempt to explain the pro-coagulant state seen in COVID-19 patients, including increased fibrinogen concentration, different receptor binding, exhausted fibrinolysis, cytokine storm, and endothelial dysfunction.The main mode of transmission of COVID-19 is human to human via droplets, the clinical syndrome being characterized by fever, cough and progression to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially in the elderly and in patients with comorbidities [2,6–8].RAAS has a central role in regulating blood pressure, mainly through its final effector, Angiotensin II (Ang II), a vasoactive hormone whose effects are mediated by its interaction with specific receptors – Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and AT2 (AT3 and AT4 receptors do not have a fully elucidated role).Thus, COVID-19 appears to generate worse outcomes in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, all of which are associated with reduced baseline levels of ACE2 expression, suggesting an imbalance in ACE1/ACE2 levels [1].First of all, histone proteins in the DNA fragments of NETs, serve as potent damage-associated molecular patterns which can further attract platelets and thereby initiate a positive feedback loop, inducing platelet aggregation through toll-like receptors on platelets.Ang II perturbates endothelial functions in multiple ways, stimulating the expression of PAI-1 messenger RNA and PAI-1 production in endothelial cells via the AT1 receptor and further increasing plasma PAI-1 levels in a dose-dependent manner.The International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) has proposed the evaluation of different parameters for the prompt recognition of coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19, such as D-dimer levels, prothrombin time, platelet count, and fibrinogen values.The use of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) to treat ARDS in COVID-19 has been proposed, being associated with temporary improvement in respiratory failure, bleeding complications remaining a major concern of this therapy [11].

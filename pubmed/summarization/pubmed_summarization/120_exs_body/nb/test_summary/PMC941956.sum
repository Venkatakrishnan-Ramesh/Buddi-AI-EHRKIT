variants expressing foreign antigens from Lassa, Zika, or rabies virus, or therapeutic candidates for chronic hepatitis B.10, 11, 12, 13 Such YF17D derivatives generally inherit the excellent safety and immunogenicity features from parental YF17D.9 However, little attention has been paid so far to the fact that the available YF17D backbone may, besides promoting the immunogenicity of the thus vectored new antigen, suffice to conjointly induce full protection from YFV infection as well; hence creating in fact dual target vaccines.14,15 Likewise, the impact of pre-existing YFV immunity on the broader usability of YF17D as vaccine vector is limited to chimeric vaccines with their antigenic surface proteins swapped for those of other flaviviruses from distinct serogroups.16 Notably, for other virus-vectored vaccines, such as adenovirus-based vaccines, pre-existing anti-vector immunity is known to strongly interfere, compromise or modify subsequent target antigen-specific immunogenicity.17.A general issue regarding viral vector vaccines concerns their sensitivity to pre-existing anti-vector immunity.17,36,47 Anti-vector immunity has shown profound impact particularly on non-replicating viral vector vaccines, such as replication-defective herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-based and various adenovirus (Ad)-based recombinant vaccines (including multiple serotypes: Ad5, Ad11, Ad35, and chimpanzee Ad) in both mice and rhesus monkeys, as well as in phase I human clinical trials.48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 In contrast, on live replication-competent viral vectors pre-existing anti-vector immunity seems to have a limited impact, as anti-measles immunity had only a minor impact on the performance of recombinant measles virus-based vaccines in mice, macaques or humans.55, 56, 57, 58 Pre-existing flavivirus immunity could affect the infection outcomes and immunogenicity of subsequent flavivirus infection or vaccination.37, 38, 39 Most studies have focused on the interference between dengue and Zika viruses as closely antigenically related and potentially prone to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection.37,38 However, despite being a widely used human vaccine and desirable viral vector, investigations on the impact of pre-existing YFV-specific immunity are limited.1,9 Interestingly, in phase 3 human trials of YF17D-based dengue vaccine CYD-TDV/Dengvaxia®, subjects with prior flaviviruses infections demonstrated rather an improved than compromised immunogenicity compared to immunologically flaviviruses naïve recipients.59,60.and K.D.and K.D.and B.M.D.and K.D.

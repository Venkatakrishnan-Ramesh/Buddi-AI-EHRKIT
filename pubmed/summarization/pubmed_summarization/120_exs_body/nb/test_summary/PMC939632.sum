Recombinant adeno-associated virus genome 2 serotype 8 vector expressing Hamp (rAAV2/8-Hamp) or its negative control (rAAV2/8-NC) was administered intravenously at week 8 of either the CDAA or CSAA diet.rAAV2/8-Hamp treatment markedly decreased liver weight and improved hepatic steatosis in the CDAA-fed mice, accompanied by changes in lipogenesis-related genes and adiponectin expression.Consistent with the in vivo findings, overexpression of Hamp increased adiponectin expression in hepatocytes and Hamp treatment inhibited HSC activation.Overexpression of Hamp using rAAV2/8-Hamp robustly attenuated liver steatohepatitis, inflammation, and fibrosis in an animal model of NASH, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for Hamp.αSMA, smooth muscle alpha-actin; COL1A1, collagen type I alpha 1 chain; CCR2, C-C motif chemokine receptor 2; TGFβ-1, transforming growth factor-beta 1; Il10, interleukin 10; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TIMP-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; SREBP1c, sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1c; ChREBP, carbohydrate response element binding protein; Acc, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; Scd1, steatoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Serum iron levels were significantly higher in the CDAA-fed mice compared to the CSAA-fed mice, but rAAV2/8-Hamp treatment did not significantly decrease serum iron levels compared to rAAV2/8-NC treatment in either the CDAA- or CSAA-fed mice (Fig.In line with these findings, livers from the CDAA-fed mice had increased mRNA levels of chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) compared to the CSAA-fed mice, whereas expression of these genes was suppressed in CDAA-fed mice treated with rAAV2/8-Hamp (Fig.Similarly, livers from CDAA-fed mice had increased mRNA levels of COL1A1, αSMA, and TIMP-1 compared to CSAA-fed mice, and rAAV2/8-Hamp treatment suppressed expression of these genes in the CDAA-fed mice (Fig.As such, iron removal therapy has become a potential treatment strategy for NASH.6,7 Given its role in regulating iron homeostasis, Hamp has gained attention as a promising therapeutic agent that can remove liver iron stores.13,14 In the present study, our data showed that rAAV2/8-Hamp treatment significantly suppressed CDAA diet-induced steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and subsequent liver fibrosis in mice.As iron loads increase, Hamp expression also increases in hepatocytes, resulting in elevated serum Hamp level.25 Patients with chronic liver diseases have evidence of liver dysfunction and anemia associated with inflammation but surprisingly also have lower serum Hamp levels compared to control subjects.26 Similar findings have been reported in alcoholic chronic liver diseases,27 chronic hepatitis C,28,29 hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis,30–33 and in autoimmune liver diseases.34 Hamp levels in NAFLD are difficult to interpret, since Hamp expression is likely to be regulated by complex mechanisms in response to diverse pathophysiological stimuli.Consistent with our data, pharmacological administration of Hamp has been shown to improve fibrosis by blocking activation of HSCs both in the CCl4 and bile duct ligation fibrosis models.42,43 Conversely, when challenged with an iron-overload diet, Hamp knockout mice displayed significant liver fibrosis associated with iron accumulation and stellate cell activation.44 In liver fibrosis, low Hamp levels cause high iron load and oxidative stress.

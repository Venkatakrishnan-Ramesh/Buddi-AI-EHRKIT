We report a case of eccrine poroma of relatively rare localization on the second toe of the left foot.A 77-year-old hypertensive woman presented to our consultation for the appearance of a painless nodular lesion on the second left toe, gradually increasing in size for 2 years without any notion of trauma.The clinical examination revealed a painless tumor, well limited, rounded, and small, measuring 7 mm Ã— 4 mm, seated at the base of the second left toe with no associated inflammatory signs.The patient underwent an X-ray of the foot, which showed a tumor(arrow) in the second left toe with no lesions of bones (Fig.Under the optical microscope, we observed a cutaneous tissue seat of non-ulcerated epidermal hyperplasia, arranged in networks that imprisoned dermal islands containing inflammatory cells in meshes.[3] in 1956 eccrine poroma is a rare benign tumor of the sweat glands composed of cells differentiating toward the acrosyringium [4].Within the clumps, signs of sudoral differentiation of the excretory-poral type are observed, represented by canaliculi with a well-differentiated spiral arrangement or, more frequently, outlined.

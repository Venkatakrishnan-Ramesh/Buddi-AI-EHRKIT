The objectives of this analysis were to: 1) assess the relationship between intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and intention to receive a seasonal influenza vaccine, 2) estimate if there was a change in the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by time over the course of the pandemic, and 3) explore retrospective changes in the perceived value of vaccines pre-pandemic compared to during the pandemic.5,081Age25–29462 (7.3 %)61 (13.2 %)401 (86.8 %)<0.000130–391,342 (21.2 %)263 (19.6 %)1,079 (80.4 %)40–491,522 (24.0 %)331 (21.7 %)1,191 (78.3 %)50–591,585 (25.0 %)370 (23.3 %)1,215 (76.7 %)60–691,422 (22.5 %)227 (16.0 %)1,195 (84.0 %)SexFemale5,517 (87.1 %)1,123 (20.4 %)4,394 (79.6 %)0.001Male809 (12.8 %)126 (15.6 %)683 (84.4 %)Missing7 (0.1 %)3 (42.9 %)4 (57.1 %)GenderWoman5,459 (86.2 %)1,117 (20.5 %)4,342 (79.5 %)0.002Man799 (12.6 %)124 (15.5 %)675 (84.5 %)Gender-diverse75 (1.2 %)11 (14.7 %)64 (85.3 %)IndigenousIndigenous217 (3.4 %)75 (34.6 %)142 (65.4 %)<0.0001Not Indigenous5,810 (91.7 %)1,103 (19.0 %)4,707 (81.0 %)Prefer not to answer51 (0.8 %)16 (31.4 %)35 (68.6 %)Missing255 (4.0 %)58 (22.7 %)197 (77.3 %)East AsianNo5,789 (91.4 %)1,139 (19.7 %)4,650 (80.3 %)0.91Yes504 (8.0 %)100 (19.8 %)404 (80.2 %)Missing40 (0.6 %)13 (32.5 %)27 (67.5 %)Southeast AsianNo6,256 (98.8 %)1,232 (19.7 %)5,024 (80.3 %)1Yes37 (0.6 %)7 (18.9 %)30 (81.1 %)Missing40 (0.6 %)13 (32.5 %)27 (67.5 %)Hispanic/LatinxNo6,195 (97.8 %)1,217 (19.6 %)4,978 (80.4 %)0.52Yes98 (1.5 %)22 (22.4 %)76 (77.6 %)Missing40 (0.6 %)13 (32.5 %)27 (67.5 %)South AsianNo6,141 (97.0 %)1,197 (19.5 %)4,944 (80.5 %)0.02Yes152 (2.4 %)42 (27.6 %)110 (72.4 %)Missing40 (0.6 %)13 (32.5 %)27 (67.5 %)BlackNo6,254 (98.8 %)1,225 (19.6 %)5,029 (80.4 %)0.02Yes39 (0.6 %)14 (35.9 %)25 (64.1 %)Missing40 (0.6 %)13 (32.5 %)27 (67.5 %)WhiteYes5,286 (83.5 %)995 (18.8 %)4,291 (81.2 %)0.0001No1,007 (15.9 %)244 (24.2 %)763 (75.8 %)Missing40 (0.6 %)13 (32.5 %)27 (67.5 %)EducationMore than High School5,540 (87.5 %)1,032 (18.6 %)4,508 (81.4 %)<0.0001High School or less783 (12.4 %)219 (28.0 %)564 (72.0 %)Missing10 (0.2 %)1 (10.0 %)9 (90.0 %)OccupationNo4,244 (67.0 %)796 (18.8 %)3,448 (81.2 %)<0.0001Yes, healthcare worker903 (14.3 %)149 (16.5 %)754 (83.5 %)Yes, other essential worker1,182 (18.7 %)305 (25.8 %)877 (74.2 %)Missing4 (0.1 %)2 (50.0 %)2 (50.0 %)Number of Adults in HouseholdOne1,466 (23.1 %)319 (21.8 %)1,147 (78.2 %)0.0002Two3,515 (55.5 %)629 (17.9 %)2,886 (82.1 %)Three or more1,335 (21.1 %)297 (22.2 %)1,038 (77.8 %)Missing17 (0.3 %)7 (41.2 %)10 (58.8 %)Household Children < 5None5,470 (86.4 %)1,076 (19.7 %)4,394 (80.3 %)0.65One525 (8.3 %)97 (18.5 %)428 (81.5 %)Two or more206 (3.3 %)44 (21.4 %)162 (78.6 %)Missing132 (2.1 %)35 (26.5 %)97 (73.5 %)Household Children 5–17None4,362 (68.9 %)820 (18.8 %)3,542 (81.2 %)0.05One926 (14.6 %)199 (21.5 %)727 (78.5 %)Two or more927 (14.6 %)199 (21.5 %)728 (78.5 %)Missing118 (1.9 %)34 (28.8 %)84 (71.2 %)Chronic Health ConditionsNone3,135 (49.5 %)630 (20.1 %)2,505 (79.9 %)0.53One or more3,189 (50.4 %)620 (19.4 %)2,569 (80.6 %)Missing9 (0.1 %)2 (22.2 %)7 (77.8 %)Intend to get seasonal influenza vaccineNo1,131 (17.9 %)575 (50.8 %)556 (49.2 %)<0.0001Yes4,370 (69.0 %)483 (11.1 %)3,887 (88.9 %)Missing832 (13.1 %)194 (23.3 %)638 (76.7 %)Received seasonal influenza vaccine in the past 5 yearsAlways/almost always3,509 (55.4 %)404 (11.5 %)3,105 (88.5 %)<0.00011–2 times1,160 (18.3 %)234 (20.2 %)926 (79.8 %)Never/Don’t know1,662 (26.2 %)614 (36.9 %)1,048 (63.1 %)Missing2 (0.0 %)0 (0.0 %)2 (100.0 %)Pandemic impact on perceived value of vaccinesNegative change134 (2.1 %)82 (61.2 %)52 (38.8 %)<0.0001No change -

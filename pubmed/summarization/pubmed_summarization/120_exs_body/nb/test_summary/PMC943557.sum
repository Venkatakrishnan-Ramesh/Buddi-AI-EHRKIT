Noncontiguous double-level Chance fractures that result from a single traumatic event are rarely reported in the literature.The authors report a case of an 18-year-old male who presented to the emergency department after a rollover motor vehicle accident.Chance in 1948, Chance fractures are unstable spine fractures that affect all three columns of a vertebra.1,2 These injuries are commonly located in the thoracolumbar junction (T10–L2) and are often seen with concurrent abdominal injuries.3,4.Both fractures were concluded to be unstable Chance fractures of bony subtype.Over 160,000 spinal injuries occur in North America every year.5 Despite this, noncontiguous double-level spinal injuries are rare, with reported incidences varying from 1.6% to 16.7%; however, more recent reports estimate a lower incidence rate.6 Unfortunately, these injuries are commonly misdiagnosed or delayed in diagnosis.7 Double-level three-column injuries have been reported more recently in the literature with a primary focus on fracture dislocations.8–12 Few reports have been released in the literature focusing on purely double-level Chance fracture.13,14.Surgical intervention for Chance fractures is warranted if there are neurological deficits, kyphosis >15°, unstable posterior elements, or if it is consistent with the ligamentous subtype.14,15 The optimal treatment strategy remains largely controversial, where strategies range from surgical fusion to nonoperative bracing.The principal treatment strategy for noncontiguous double-level spinal injuries is surgery; largely, the approach is composed of posterior open fusion surgery or minimally invasive techniques.6 Recently, retrospective studies have begun to compare the outcomes of tension band injuries managed by the anterior versus posterior approaches.Additional benefits were reported favoring the posterior approach, although future studies should develop and confirm these initial findings.16 However, in the context of multiple injuries, percutaneous fixation provides an advantage through reduced muscle trauma and postoperative complications while accomplishing similar clinical and radiological results.17,18.Although short-segment fixation has been reported for osseous Chance fractures, long-segment posterior fixation for flexion-distraction injuries with pedicle screws continues to be the most established surgical treatment in the literature.14,19,20 Our case complements the recent reports recommending more extensive fixation for severe multilevel spinal injuries, based on the outcomes experienced by our patient.8,9.Given the long history of missed secondary spinal injuries and mechanism of flexion-distraction injuries, full spine and emergency protocol radiological assessment is needed to identify the lesion in full and assess potential abdominal injuries.Although our report supports recommendations made by previous case reports in favor of more extensive instrumentation for multilevel noncontiguous spinal injuries, future research should be directed toward investigating optimal treatment for noncontiguous unstable flexion-distraction injuries.

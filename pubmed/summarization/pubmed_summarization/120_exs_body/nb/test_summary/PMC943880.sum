In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of anemia on the severity of COVID-19 based on the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of the patients noted at the time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), to mark Hb as a prognostic marker of disease severity for the future.Retrospective data was collected from 784 patients admitted to the COVID adult ICU between March and June 2021.This suggests that anemia is independently an important parameter that plays a role in severity of COVID-19.Upon observing a significant correlation between anemia and COVID-19 severity, it can be stated that anemia should be considered as an independent prognostic risk factor for COVID-19 and that hemoglobin can be used for risk stratification in patients under home or hospital care.[4] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) summarizes comorbidities that have significant association with increasing risk of severe COVID-19 illness, namely, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2, heart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies), obesity (BMI â‰¥30 kg/m2), pregnancy, and smoking (current and former).In our study, we aimed to observe the trends of disease progression in patients who succumbed to COVID-19 without any other comorbidity except anemia and compared whether anemia was in anyway a marker of worsening of COVID-19.With this hypothesis, we analyzed the ICU admissions of COVID-19 that occurred in hospitals attached to Dr. S. N. Medical College, Jodhpur, with the sole purpose to prevent the severity of the disease with one modifiable risk factor, anemia, in the forthcoming COVID-19 waves.Comorbidities as per CDC guidelines, that is, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2, heart conditions (such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies), and smoking (current and former), were included and marked as known risk factors for COVID-19 severity.Our cross-sectional, retrospective study of 784 patients admitted with COVID-19 in Jodhpur, Rajasthan showed that anemia on admission was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 infection and that it was predictive of the severity of SARS-CoV-2, that is, death.

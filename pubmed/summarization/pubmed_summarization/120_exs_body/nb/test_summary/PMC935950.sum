Multivariate analysis for factors associated with inpatient admissions in last 28 days for patients with CVD reported that patients with age greater than 70 years are 2.8 (1.86-4.18) times higher risk of hospital admission as compared with the patients 25-30 years of age.The pre-existing CVD with age and other comorbidities predict the risk for hospitalization and further complications in patients with COVID-19.Hypertension has been reported as a 'risk factor' for COVID-19 but there has been a lack of clarity as to whether this means risk factor for acquiring the disease, the severity of disease, or for poor outcomes.9 In Qatar (2012), leading causes of disease burden among the population were ischemic heart disease (11.8%), road traffic accidents, birth asphyxia, and birth trauma.10 The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is also rising in Qatar and is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events, which results in a higher rate of mortality.11.We collected information about complete blood count, Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), urea, creatinine, pro- B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) proteins, estimated glomerular filtration rate, alanine amino transferase, aspartate amino transferase, and total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, ferritin, Trop T, procalcitonin, chest X ray, electrocardiogram, tread mill test, stress electrocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography angiogram, myocardial perfusion scan, and angiography wherever available.Other comorbidities were obesity (18.3%; n=1862), kidney disease (6.5%; n=659), hematologic problems (4.2%; n=425), liver disorders (1.4%; n=142), rheumatic heart disease (1.3%; n=131), and neurologic symptoms (1.3%; n=128).Table 1Demographic Characteristic and Clinical Histories ComorbiditiesCharacteristicNumber of Cases (N=10,178)PercentageAge distribution, y 25-302793% 30-40160316% 40-50300630% 50-60320732% 60-70179618% >7027823%Gender Male652764% Female365136%Nationality Qatari229923% Non-Qatari787977%Comorbidities Diabetes708669.62% Hypertension696568.43% Dyslipidemia459045.10% Rheumatic Heart disease1311.29% Kidney disease6596.47% Neurologic symptoms1281.26% Hematologic problem4254.18% Liver disorder1421.40% Obesity186218.29%.About 2.9% (n=293) had asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease post COVID-19, 1.7% (n=169) had coronary artery disease, 0.6% (n=63) had cerebrovascular disease, 0.5% (n=51) had acute respiratory distress syndrome, 0.08% (n=8) had pulmonary embolism, and 0.01% (n=1) had myocarditis.Table 2Study Outcome in the Last 28 Days AdmissionNumber of Cases (N=10,178)Incidence/100Inpatient admission274026.9%ICU admission2872.8%Myocarditis10.01%Coronary artery disease1691.7%Pulmonary embolism80.1%Pneumonia172917%Acute respiratory distress syndrome510.5%Asthma/COPD affects post COVID-192932.9%Cerebrovascular disease630.6%COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling cascade has a critical role in cell proliferation and NSCLC survival.10 Drugs, for instance the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib have been shown to reduce tumor sizes in NSCLC patients with EGFR-activating mutations.11 However, due to drug resistance, the overall clinical efficacy from these drugs in NSCLC individuals is low.12 Therefore, it is important to identify novel biologic signatures to complement the initial EGFR mutation status for enhanced prediction of EGFR-TKIs responsivity and elucidate on molecular mechanisms of EGFR-TKIs acquired resistance.NCAPG was abundant in cytoplasms of LUAD cells and neighboring non-malignant lung tissue cells (Figure 2B).Table 1Comparative Expression of NCAPG mRNA in 6 GEO Oncomine DatasetsAuthorDatasetGroupSample Size (Tumor/Normal)p valuet TestFold ChangeHou et alGSE19188LUAD vs Normal65/451.86E-1510.883.490LUSC vs Normal65/272.70E-3120.7956.017Su et alGSE7670LUAD vs Normal27/305.80E-107.4762.747Okayama et alGSE31210LUAD vs Normal226/205.68E-129.7292.693Wachi et alGSE3268LUSC vs Normal5/58.44E-56.7411.379Selamat et alGSE32863LUAD vs Normal58/583.66E-1610.8031.861Landi et alGSE10072LUAD vs Normal48/582.32E-128.0311.652.Figure 1Expression levels of NCAPG mRNA in LUAD and LUSC.LUAD patients in TCGA-LUAD (Figure 4A), GEO31210 (Figure 4B and C), GSE30219 (Figure 4D) and GSE72094 (Figure 4E-G) datasets with elevated NCAPG levels had markedly worse OS outcomes, especially early-stage LUAD patients.These findings imply that over-expression of NCAPG is associated with poorer survival outcomes in LUAD patients, but not LUSC patients.Figure 4Association of NCAPG expression level with survival of patients with LUAD.In addition, NCAPG levels were established to independent predictors of PFS for LUAD patients in GEO31210 and GSE30219 LUAD datasets (Figure 5A and B).Figure 5The prognostic value of NCAPG in LUAD patients.NCAPG levels in EGFR-TKIs resistant LUAD patients were markedly elevated, relative to those in EGFR-TKIs sensitive LUAD patients (Figure 8E, t=3.651, p=0.0006).Survival analyses showed that elevated NCAPG levels and TP53 mutations were associated with poor OS in LUAD (Figure 9C, p<0.05), whereas elevated NCAPG and low TP53 levels correlated with poor OS in LUAD patients (Figure 9D, p<0.05).Figure 9The association between NCAPG over-expression and TP53 abnormality in LUAD patients.(A).(A).

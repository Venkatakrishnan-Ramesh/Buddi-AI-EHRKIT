This procedure as a standalone operation delivers IOP reductions consistent with filtration surgery, and in combination with cataract surgery delivers both IOP and medication reductions at least as great as other minimally invasive procedures.Given the broad base of evidence supporting its use in a wide variety of clinical scenarios, excisional goniotomy with the KDB can play a meaningful role in the achievement of patient-specific glaucoma therapy goals.These aggregate findings support the efficacy and safety of excisional goniotomy with the KDB and clarify the patient profiles best suited for this procedure.Dorairaj S, Radcliffe NM, Grover DS, et al.Goniotomy was first described by Barkan as the incision of one quarter to one-third of the nasal trabecular meshwork (TM) via a temporal peripheral corneal incision under intraoperative gonioscopy in a series of 11 adult eyes in 1936.1 The first PubMed-indexed case of goniotomy in a child came in 1944.2 Scheie subsequently more fully characterized goniotomy in congenital glaucoma,3,4 and by 1953 in the Jackson Memorial Lecture, Barkan conceded that this procedure's indication was limited to congenital glaucoma.5 In the late 20th century, several variations of goniotomy for adult glaucoma (both laser6,7 and incisional8) were described but did not gain traction clinically.Recently, novel surgical techniques have arisen from the need for a safe procedure with a benefit/risk profile acceptable for deployment earlier in the treatment sequence.11–14 These procedures as initially described had five distinct attributes: they were performed via an ab interno microincision; were minimally traumatic to both target and neighboring ocular tissues; delivered at least modest efficacy; had a favorable safety profile that avoided hypotony and bleb-related complications; and permitted rapid recovery, particularly with regard to visual acuity.15 More recently, hybrid procedures have sought to bridge the gap between minimally invasive and more traditional procedures by utilizing subconjunctival filtration; these procedures deliver greater efficacy than TM-based procedures but are associated with bleb-related risks.11–14.The angle of the distal cutting surface and the diameter of the device shaft are designed for maximum angle treatment through a single clear corneal incision.21 In a laboratory experiment, the KDB demonstrated more complete TM removal than either a microvitreoretinal (MVR) blade or trabecular ablation using the Trabectome (Microsurgical Technology, Redmond, WA), with minimal residual leaflets of TM and no damage to neighboring tissues.22 A histological analysis of excised TM strips from adult eyes with glaucoma confirmed the presence of TM in all samples,23 in contrast to trabeculectomy in which up to 40% of cases do not excise TM.24 A second-generation KDB instrument (KDB Glide, New World Medical) is in development that features beveled edges and rounded corners on the footplate to facilitate greater ease of passage along the canal while preserving ramp and blade dimensions and configuration.Combined with phacoemulsification: Efficacy outcomes in samples composed chiefly of eyes with open-angle glaucoma undergoing combined surgery have been reported in one randomized clinical trial,32 six retrospective controlled studies (one reported at two time points33,34),35–39 and seven retrospective uncontrolled studies [one reported at two time points26,40; another reported a pooled sample of primarily combined cases (90%)41].21,29–31,42 In these 17 reports with follow-up ranging from 4–18 months, mean IOP reductions of 11–34% and mean medication reductions of 11–79% were described.These ranges were generally consistent across the various study designs with the exception of the randomized trial (17% IOP reduction, 79% medication reduction), which enrolled primarily patients with mild disease (79%) whose baseline IOP was quite low (18.5 mm Hg) suggesting medication reduction as the goal of surgery in most cases.32 Importantly in eyes undergoing concurrent cataract surgery for visual rehabilitation, visual acuity outcomes were not compromised with the addition of excisional goniotomy with the KDB in the studies cited above, and the combined procedure was not associated with refractive surprise (Table 1).43.In an effort to better characterize patient-specific surgical goals, three investigative groups conducted subgroup analyzes stratifying subjects by baseline IOP above vs below the mean or median preoperative IOP, with the assumption being that patients with higher baseline IOP likely underwent surgery to achieve IOP reduction while those with lower baseline IOP more likely sought to achieve medication reduction.26,34,40 As might be expected, IOP reductions were greater in eyes with higher baseline IOP than with lower baseline IOP, while medication reductions were generally similar in the two groups (Table 2).While this reveals a clear bias on the investigators’ part for excisional goniotomy in eyes with more severe glaucoma, it underscores the challenges of retrospective comparisons: in this case, significantly greater medication reductions were seen in micro bypass eyes (59% vs 36%, p < 0.01), but the patient characteristics suggest that far more micro bypass eyes underwent surgery at an earlier disease stage and may have preferentially sought medication reduction compared to the excisional goniotomy eyes that underwent surgery at a later stage and likely sought IOP reduction (which was greater in excisional goniotomy eyes—26% vs 19%, p = 0.03).In an infant with bilateral glaucoma, IOP was reduced from 35 mm Hg and 52 mm Hg to 17 mm Hg and 18 mm Hg in right and left eyes, respectively.49 In a similar report, IOP was reduced from −21 mm Hg in the right eye of an infant but failed to lower IOP in the left eye following three excisional goniotomy procedures necessitating implantation of a tube-shunt.50 In a 14-year-old with juvenile OAG, mean IOP was reduced from 28–15 mm Hg.51.

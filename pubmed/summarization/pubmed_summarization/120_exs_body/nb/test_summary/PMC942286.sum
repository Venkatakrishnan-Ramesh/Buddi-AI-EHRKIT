there was no difference in ADL outcomes immediately after intervention (SMD 0.13, 95% CI − 0.02 to 0.28; P = 0.09; I2 = 7%; 14 studies, 864 people with stroke; very low-certainty evidence), at medium-term, two weeks to six months after the intervention ended, (SMD 0.01, 95% CI − 0.15 to 0.16; P = 0.94; I2 = 0%; 10 studies, 673 people with stroke; very low-certainty evidence), and at long-term, more than six months after the treatment ended, (SMD 0.09, 95% CI − 0.39 to 0.57; P = 0.71; 1 studies, 67 people with stroke; low-certainty evidence);.There is very low certainty about whether the amount of time spent in rehabilitation makes any difference in ADL outcomes (immediately and at medium-term after intervention), activity measures of the upper limb (immediately and at medium-term after intervention), activity measures of the lower limb (at medium-term after intervention), motor impairment measures of the upper limb (at medium-term after intervention), motor impairment measures of the lower limb (at medium-term after intervention), and serious adverse events (at medium-term after intervention).

The development of dropped head syndrome (DHS) is followed by severe cervical extensor muscle weakness, resulting in head overflexion or chin-on-chest deformity in the standing or sitting upright position.1 Isolated neck extensor myopathy (INEM) is 1 type of DHS and has been described in patients with cervical extensor muscle weakness in the absence of neuromuscular disorders.2 The etiology of DHS due to INEM has a low prevalence, even in elderly female persons.1 However, as the proportion of elderly people continues to rise, the number of patients with DHS due to degenerative changes is likely to increase as well.3,4 Patients with DHS present with inability to maintain a horizontal gaze and occasionally with cervical pain.1st Interv = first intervention since DHS onset; C = cervical local kyphotic type DHS; Clin Grad = clinical grading; D = diffuse spinal kyphosis-type DHS; Recur = periods of recurrence; Pain Follow = pain at DHS follow-up; Pain Onset = pain at dropped head syndrome onset; âˆ’ = painless; + = moderate pain; ++ = severe pain.Six cases (cases 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8) showed improvement, and their first interventions were between 0.1 and 12 months (average: 3.6 months), although 3 cases (cases 2, 6, 8) had recurrence (Tables 1 and 2).Echography was performed in 4 cases (cases 2, 5, 7, 8) and pathological examinations in 3 cases (cases 2, 3, 8).reported a case of natural recovery of myogenic cervical kyphosis (myogenic head drop) in 24 months.8 Previous literature mentioned that positive outcome by observation/bracing/physical therapy was 18.2% (6/33 cases)10 and 20.9% (14/67 cases).3 In the current study, 4 of 8 cases showed improvement in their horizontal gaze disturbance, and sudden-onset DHS had a better prognosis.Pathological findings from muscle biopsy revealed fiber degeneration, regeneration, and necrosis with scattered inflammatory cells, which were similar to results of the previous report.8 Based on those findings, sudden-onset DHS is likely associated with acute cervical soft tissue damage and muscle weakness due to degenerative change.11,12 In chronic phase, the regenerative process may occur, while causing angiogenesis, and some DHS cases could develop irreversible change caused by muscle fibrous degeneration.Regarding global spinal alignment, type C was noted in 6 cases and type D in 2 cases of sudden-onset DHS.Sudden-onset DHS occurred in 12.1% (8/66) of DHS cases due to INEM.

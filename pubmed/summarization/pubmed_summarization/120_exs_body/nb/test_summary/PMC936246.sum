Clinical and demographic characteristics of the affected people, including the outcomes of TTS events, need to be examined using available information to better understand aspects of this association.To analyse clinical and demographic information of TTS events, including calculating the case fatality of reported cases of TTS by age and sex, using spontaneously reported data from the UK’s Yellow Card spontaneous reporting system of suspected adverse drug reactions.TTS events reported to the Yellow Card scheme were extracted at weekly time points between 12 May 2021 and 25 May 2022.In the UK, there were small but insignificant differences in cumulative case fatality of thrombosis with concurrent thrombocytopenia (thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS]) following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccine AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria), by age but not sex.Case fatality has remained stable since May 2021, at which time risk minimisation measures were implemented to prevent TTS in younger vaccine recipients.As Vaxzevria is in wide use across the world, it is important to report on findings from the UK where a large proportion of the population were exposed.We calculated the proportion of events with a fatal outcome (case fatality) for cases of TTS that had been spontaneously reported in the UK following any dose of Vaxzevria.Further research is required to establish the true incidence of TTS following Vaxzevria.Table 1Overall number of events (cumulative) of thrombosis with concurrent thrombocytopenia reported to the MHRA, cumulative number of fatal cases reported, and cumulative case fatality (%) at weekly intervals [6]DateCases reported (cumulative)Fatal events (cumulative)Cumulative case fatalityCase fatality(%)Lower95% CI (%)Upper95% CI (%)12 May 20212625119.4714.8524.7919 May3325817.4713.5421.9902 Jun3726617.7414.0022.0109 Jun3907118.2114.5022.4016 Juna3896817.4813.8421.6223 Jun3957017.7214.0821.8530 Jun3997117.7914.1721.9114 Jul4117117.2713.7421.2818 Aug4177217.2713.7621.2425 Aug4157217.3513.8221.3401 Sep4167217.3113.8021.3008 Sep4197217.1813.6921.1415 Sep4197217.1813.6921.1429 Sep4217217.1013.6321.0506 Oct4247216.9813.5320.9013 Oct4217217.1013.6321.0520 Oct4237217.0213.5620.9527 Oct4247216.9813.5320.9003 Nov4257317.1813.7121.1110 Nov4257317.1813.7121.1117 Nov4267317.1413.6821.0601 Dec4287417.2913.8321.2108 Dec4287417.2913.8321.2115 Dec4297517.4814.0121.4122 Dec4307517.4413.9721.3705 Jan 20224337617.5514.0921.4712 Jan4357617.4714.0221.3719 Jan4357717.7014.2321.6225 Jan4367817.8914.4121.8202 Feb4377817.8514.3721.7709 Feb4387918.0414.5521.9616 Feb4387918.0414.5521.9623 Feb4387918.0414.5521.9602 Mara4377817.8514.3721.7709 Mar4387918.0414.5521.9616 Mar4387918.0414.5521.9623 Mar4387918.0414.5521.9630 Mar4397918.0014.5121.9106 Apr4407917.9514.4821.8704 May4438118.2814.7922.2011 May4438118.2814.7922.2018 May4438118.2814.7922.2025 May4438118.2814.7922.20CI confidence interval, MHRA Medicines and Health products Regulatory AgencyaDue to the MHRA merging cases and further reviewing events reported during follow-up, the counts decreased for this week.Overall number of events (cumulative) of thrombosis with concurrent thrombocytopenia reported to the MHRA, cumulative number of fatal cases reported, and cumulative case fatality (%) at weekly intervals [6].CIs were calculated for case fatality for each age group at data lock (Table 2); although imprecise due to small numbers of reported cases, 95% CIs overlap for all age groups, suggesting no statistical difference in case fatality depending on age.Table 2Cumulative case fatality of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia events reported to the Yellow Card Scheme to 25 May 2022Age group (years)No.To 25 May 2022, there had been no reports of TTS after a third dose of Vaxzevria in the UK [6].In the UK, case fatality of TTS following Vaxzevria reported to the Yellow Card scheme has remained stable at approximately 17–18% since May 2021.

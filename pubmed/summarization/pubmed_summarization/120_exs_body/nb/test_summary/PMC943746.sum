The acromioclavicular (AC) joint is a diarthrodial joint serving as the articulation between the scapula and clavicle and is responsible for both scapulohumeral and clavicular motion, allowing the shoulder to perform dynamic movements.1,2 AC-joint dislocations are a common injury, affecting 2 of every 10,000 people in the general population and comprise 9% to 12% of all injuries to the shoulder.1,3,4 Most injuries occur through contact activity, which drives the acromion inferiorly with the clavicle remaining in its anatomic position, initiating a cascade of injury propagating from the AC ligament followed by failure of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments.5,6 Many techniques have been described for AC joint injuries, without a consensus gold standard.7 The revision setting offers even less consensus on treatment options and countless difficulties for surgeons.There have been more than 60 described procedures regarding AC and CC ligament reconstructions, with significant controversy regarding the optimal intervention for each injury.7,8 When these techniques fail, it is important to pinpoint the mechanism of failure to construct a successful plan for revision.9,10 Fracture and loss of reduction are the 2 most common complications and occur the most in patients with chronic instability.9,11 Previous bone tunnels, which occur in up to 20% of cases, make the coracoid both susceptible to fracture and a difficult complication to handle intraoperatively.12,13 Loss of reduction occurs up to 23% of cases and has been found to be correlated with bone quality, button placement, and adjunct operations conducted to reinforce the repair.14 Surgeons must be mindful of these challenges in the revision scenario and must select their constructs accordingly.Improperly positioned tunnels must be repositioned, overly large tunnels may be addressed using screw fixationCareful retraction or dissection adjacent to the coracoid; the musculocutaneous nerve must be protectedTo restore native stability, the surgeon must position bone tunnels at the site of native conoid (medial-most, 30-45 mm medial from the AC joint) and trapezoid (lateral-most, 15 mm lateral from the conoid, and more anterior)Careful drilling near coracoid or acromion to prevent injuries to neurovascular structures or rotator cuffFluoroscopy should be used to confirm adequate reduction of both AC and CC jointsAdequate spacing of tunnels to prevent convergence or fractureThe AC joint should be over-reduced during initial fixation due to an inevitable amount of creep in the tendon graftRisk of coracoid fracture if old and new drill holes are too close.These tunnels should be oriented accordingly: (1) approximately 35 to 40 mm to the AC joint and slightly posterior on the clavicle to recreate the conoid ligament and (2) approximately 20 to 25 mm medial to the AC joint (corresponding to 15 mm lateral to the first clavicular tunnel), which is used to match the anatomic footprint of the trapezoid ligament.Fig 3Midline acromion tunnel drilling.Acromioclavicular ligament reconstruction.Drill holes through the clavicle and/or coracoid serve as stress risers, which may cause the construct to fail as a result of conjoined tendon tears, fracture, or cutout.21,22 A biomechanical study by Martetschläger et al.23 that examined the effect of coracoid drilling in 18 fresh-frozen cadaveric scapulae following anatomic CC ligament reconstruction found that single drill holes of 2.4 mm resulted in greater load to failure than one or two 4-mm drill holes (506 ± 73.3 N for one 2.4-mm tunnel vs 392 ± 98.2 N for two 4-mm tunnels, and 459 ± 143.8 N for one 4-mm tunnel, P = .015).While the CC ligament may portend vertical stability, isolated reconstruction of the CC ligament is subjected to greater horizontal forces without the stress shielding presence of AC ligaments.25,26 In their biomechanical study, Gonzalez-Lomas et al.16 highlights the importance of the AC ligaments as horizontal stabilizers, reporting a 50% decrease in horizontal translation when both AC and CC ligaments are repaired compared with free tissue isolated CC ligament reconstruction.

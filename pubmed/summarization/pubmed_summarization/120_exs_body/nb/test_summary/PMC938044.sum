This retrospective study from a single surgical center aimed to study the surgical management of 48 patients with retrosternal goiter and tracheal stenosis diagnosed and treated from January 2017 to December 2021.All preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scans showed retrosternal goiter and tracheal stenosis.RG was classified into type I in 28 patients, type II in 12 patients, and type III in 8 patients.TS was classified into grade I in 31 patients, grade II in 11 patients, and grade III in 6 patients.All patients were referred for surgery.There were 41 patients with transcervical incision, 4 with cervical incision+sternotomy, 2 with cervical incision and thoracoscopic surgery, and 1 with cervical incision and surgery via the subxiphoid approach.According to the chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images and clinical signs of RG extending into the sternum, it can be divided into 3 types [2]: type I, after over half of the cervical goiter enters the sternum, the lower pole reaches the superior margin of the aortic arch (Figure 1A); type II, the goiter is almost entirely posterior to the sternum, with the lower pole behind the aortic arch or entering the postmediastinum (Figure 1B); and type III, a huge intrathoracic goiter protrudes into the thorax, which may be accompanied by superior vena cava compression syndrome (Figure 1C).The Cotton-Myer classification system is based on endoscopic estimates of the airspace cross-sectional area (CSA) at the subglottis and classifies obstruction severity as follows: grade I stenosis, less than 50% obstruction(Figure 2A); grade II stenosis, 51% to 70% obstruction (Figure 2B); grade III stenosis, 71% to 99% obstruction (Figure 2C); and grade IV stenosis, no detectable lumen or complete stenosis [7].Patients with retrosternal goiter and tracheal stenosis often have a variety of perioperative comorbidities and complications, and it is necessary to have a full multidisciplinary team in place, including specialists in thoracic surgery, thyroid surgery, otolaryngology, anesthesiology, endocrinology, radiology, pathology, cardiology, vascular surgery, gastroenterology, intensive care, and nursing coordination.The clinical data of 48 patients with retrosternal goiter and tracheal stenosis treated by thoracic surgery and thyroid surgery from January 2017 to December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed (Table 1).RG was classified into type I in 28 patients, type II in 12 patients, and type III in 8 patients.TS was classified as grade I in 31 patients, grade II in 11 patients, and grade III in 6 patients (Table 1).There were 41 patients with transcervical incision, 4 with cervical incision+sternotomy, 2 with cervical incision+thoracoscopic surgery, and 1 with cervical incision+surgery via the subxiphoid approach (Table 2).An extra-cervical approach often depends on the CT scan-based depth of goiter expansion in the mediastinum and extension beyond the aortic arch [19].We also think that patients with grade III TS or type III RG may be more suitable for an extra-cervical incision.

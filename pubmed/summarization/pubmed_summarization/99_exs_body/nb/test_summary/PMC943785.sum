This model was trained, validated, and tested on 1,554 bumble bee and 1,475 non-bumble bee images.We hypothesize that 1) within each clade, bee mimics will exhibit lower model classification accuracy compared to their non-mimic counterparts, and 2) wasp mimics will exhibit intermediate accuracy; furthermore, 3) bee mimics that are believed to exploit aggressive mimicry toward bees will exhibit better mimicry—as defined by lower classification accuracy—compared to bee mimics that employ only defensive mimicry.Another 683 bee and 539 non-bee grayscale versions of those same images were used for the evaluation of the models with grayscale images.Comparison of accuracy (in %) between three VGG16-based models that classify bees from non-bees, evaluated against testing images of bee mimics and non-bee mimics (italicized).Another 683 bee and 539 non-bee grayscale versions of those same images were used for the evaluation of the models with grayscale images.Comparison of accuracy (in %) between three ResNet-101-based models that classify bumble bees from non-bumble bee bees, evaluated against testing images of bee mimics and non-bee mimics (italicized).For the mimics studied, the bee vs. non-bee model (VGG16-based) yielded lower classification accuracies compared to those of the bumble bee vs. non-bumble bee model (ResNet-101-based) (Table 5 and 8).Lastly, one limitation of our bumble bee model is that all of the training images were of bees (bumble bees and non-bumble bee bees), with no training images of non-bees.

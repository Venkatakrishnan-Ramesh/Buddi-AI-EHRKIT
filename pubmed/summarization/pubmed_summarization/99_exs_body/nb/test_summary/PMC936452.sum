Postoperative pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL-6) blood concentrations after lumbar spine surgery are related to postoperative pain and inflammation.The purpose of this prospective randomized parallel controlled study was to assess postoperative pain and serum levels of pro-inflammatory IL-6 after posterior lumbar decompression and stabilization surgery with a classical and modified technique of TLIP block.This prospective randomized, single-blinded controlled pilot study was conducted on eight patients who will undergo posterior lumbar decompression and stabilization surgery.The classic TLIP block is performed by local anesthetic injection between them.There is limited study comparing postoperative analgesic effect of modified and classic TLIP in lumbar spine surgery.After obtaining informed consent, the participants were divided randomly into two groups: classic TLIP block group and modified-TLIP block group.TLIP block is an interfascial block of choice for perioperative pain management in spine surgery, either classic TLIP or modified TLIP (16).There is a limited study comparing the postoperative analgesic effect of modified and classic TLIP in lumbar spine surgery.IL-6 level in the modified TLIP group was higher than in the classic group 6 hours postoperatively.However, the NRS was lower in the modified TLIP group than in the classic TLIP group.

Pileus 10–40 mm diam, convex to conico-convex then applanate, sometimes depressed to umbilicate at the centre, not hygrophanous, not translucently striate or up to half the radius in well hydrated specimens, vivid blue (Italian collection) to dark blue or blue grey, almost black at centre, paler, more grey-tinged in old specimens, especially at the margin, finely fibrillose-tomentose, more squamulose towards the centre.Pileus 10–35 mm diam, campanulate to convex then plano-convex with acute or slightly flattened to truncate centre, with straight, later somewhat crenulate margin, medium to dark reddish brown with darker, blackish brown centre (“eye”), vaguely translucently striate when fresh, then distinctly and deeply translucently striate, minutely granulose all over at first, later covered with fine fibrillose patches, more or less glabrous towards margin.Pileus 10–25 mm broad, campanulate to convex, expanding with age with umbilicate center and undulating margin, not distinctly hygrophanous, deeply translucently striate when moist, very dark sepia at centre, moderately dark brown on limb and paler brown at margin and between the striae, rather smooth when young, then innately fibrillose breaking up in scattered, irregular and relatively coarse squamules with age.Pileus 10–25(–30) mm diam, conico-campanulate then hemispherical, with small but usually marked depression, sometimes truncate-conical to convex, initially not hygrophanous and hardly translucently striate, becoming translucently striate-grooved, entirely blackish-blue to deep violaceus blue at first, then fading to pale mouse-grey, sometimes however, retaining the blackish-blue colour at centre, finally discolouring whitish to pale pinkish with age.Pileus 10–25 mm diam, hemispherical to convex, finally expanded, with blunt, subumbilicate centre, not hygrophanous, initially not translucently striate, but becoming deeply translucently striate to centre with age, very dark blackish blue and entirely tomentose at first, then paler between the striate and at margin, more purplish brown, with fine, dark blue, pointed squamules all over.Pileus 5–25(–40) mm broad, campanulate or conical then convex or plano-convex with involute then deflexed margin, usually with distinctly umbilicate centre to funnel-shaped, more rarely with slight depression or with small umbo, weakly to distinctly hygrophanous, when moist usually deeply translucently striate, rarely not, pinkish brown, yellowish brown to reddish brown, darker at centre and on striae, sometimes blue or violaceous-brown, slightly to distinctly pallescent on drying to greyish brown, minutely squamulose at centre, fibrillose towards margin or minutely tomentose-squamulose all over.

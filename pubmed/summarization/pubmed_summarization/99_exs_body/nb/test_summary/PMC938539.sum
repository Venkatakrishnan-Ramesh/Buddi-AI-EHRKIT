Using demographic, clinical, visual field, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) variables to study the association of 5-year glaucomatous progression in glaucoma suspect eyes.This is a retrospective longitudinal clinical study.The percentage of glaucoma suspect eyes, which progressed to glaucoma within a 5-year period, was calculated.Study subjects were divided into the following groups: eyes that progressed to glaucoma and those that did not.In the 288 patients which we looked at, 365 total eyes, 323 eyes had concerning cup-to-disk ratio and 42 had ocular hypertension.A total number of 365 eyes from 288 patients (323 eyes with concerning cup-to-disk ratio and 42 eyes with ocular hypertension) with mean age of 59.08 ± 11.24 years old were included in this study.This retrospective longitudinal study included 365 glaucoma suspect eyes of 288 patients.The majority of glaucoma suspicious eyes in our study were based on optic nerve appearance.There is still controversy regarding whether structural changes precede functional loss as measured by perimetry.14–23 Although studies have different definitions for structural and functional progression, some studies have reported that structural changes precede functional changes in glaucoma progression.14,24,25 The OHTS has shown that 35% of patients with visual field loss were without any sign of structural progression.8 Medeiros et al.25 and Sehi et al.14 have similarly reported that 34% and 37% of all glaucoma suspect individuals, respectively, developed visual field defects without structural progression.In our study, we found eyes in the progressed group have significantly thinner baseline average, superior and inferior RNFL thicknesses in bivariate analysis.found that OCT RNFL measurements at baseline was an independent predictor for development of glaucomatous change in glaucoma suspect/preperimetric glaucoma and glaucomatous eyes.In conclusion, we found that severe baseline inferior RNFL damage and PSD were significantly associated with 5-year glaucomatous progression in glaucoma suspect eyes.

We estimated the transmission rates and infection counts for neighborhoods and POIs.2021) based on mobility data and the SEIR model to estimate transmission rates and infection counts in neighborhoods and POIs.Figure 4 shows the mean transmission rates (λ¯ci) at the CBG level of the three MSAs.Figure 5 shows the mean transmission rates (λ¯pj) of the top 15 POI categories of the three MSAs.The POI category ratio is the ratio of the infection count of a category to the total infection count of all categories in an MSA.Figure 10 shows the POIs with more than 30 infections that occurred in the MSAs.λ¯ci showed opposite associations with the mean transmission rate of visited POIs in Greenville (r = −0.124, p < 0.01) compared with Columbia (r = 0.429, p < 0.001) and Charleston (r = 0.403, p < 0.001).The median household income had a positive correlation with λ¯ci across all three MSAs (Greenville, r =0.221, p < 0.001; Columbia, r = 0.135, p < 0.01; Charleston, r = 0.103, p < 0.05).The infection counts from POIs had a strong correlation with POI transmission rates.For example, the percent of the White population in CBGs shows a positive correlation with median house income (r = 0.489, p < 0.001), and negative correlations with poverty (r = −0.437, p < 0.001), less higher education (r = −0.386, p < 0.001), unemployed (r = −0.355, p < 0.001), uninsured (r = −0.314, p < 0.001) and severe mortgage burden (r = −0.245, p < 0.001).

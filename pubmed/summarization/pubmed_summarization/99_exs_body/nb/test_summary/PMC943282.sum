Corneal thickness was measured using OCT. End point analysis included corneal endothelial cell density, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and corneal lactate concentration.In the young animals, AAV9-Slc4a11 reversed corneal edema, endothelial cell loss, mitochondrial oxidative stress, lactate transporter expression, and corneal lactate concentration to the levels observed in wild-type animals.The corneal endothelium is a single layer of nonproliferating cells that line the posterior side of the cornea.1,2 These cells maintain corneal transparency through an active pump mechanism that moves water linked to lactate transport across the endothelium from the stroma into the aqueous humor, thereby requiring an intact osmotic barrier.1,2 Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) is a rare recessive condition that affects 3 of 100000 newborns each year,2,3 leading to bilateral corneal edema and clouding.4–7 Mutations in Slc4a11, which codes for a plasma membrane H+ transporter and an ammonia sensitive mitochondrial uncoupler,6 lead to CHED.4.A total of 3 (2 male and 1 female) animals were used.For young animals, 2 male and 1 female Slc4a11+/+ and 2 male and 2 female Slc4a11−/− animals were used for a total number of 7 young animals.For older animals, 2 male and 1 female Slc4a11+/+ and 3 male and 3 female Slc4a11−/− animals were used for a total number of 9 older animals.Three male and 2 female older animals per group, for a total of 10 animals, were used.Three animals (2 female and 1 male per group) were used for both young and older animals.Three animals (2 male and 1 female per group) were used for both young and older animals.Supporting these observations, the expression of the major lactate transporters in the corneal endothelium increased with AAV9-HA-Slc4a11 in young animals but less in older animals.

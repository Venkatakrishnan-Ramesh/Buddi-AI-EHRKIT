We found no mortality benefit of combination two weeks AmBd and FLU compared to AmBd alone.Dose of fluconazole ranged from 200 mg/day to 1200 mg/day.Overall, 712 HIV‐positive adults with first episode of cryptococcal meningitis were randomized 2:1:1:1:1 to (i) two weeks of 5FC 100 mg/kg/day and FLU 1200 mg/day, (ii) two weeks of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and FLU 1200 mg/day, (iii) two weeks of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and 5FC 100 mg/kg/day, (iv) one week of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and FLU 1200 mg/day followed on days 8 to 14 by FLU 1200 mg/day, or (v) one week of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and 5FC 100 mg/kg/day followed by FLU 1200 mg/day on days 8 to 14.At two weeks, there was no significant difference in mortality in participants randomized to two weeks of 5FC and FLU compared to participants randomized to two weeks of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and 5FC 100 mg/kg/day (340 participants, 1 study, Analysis 5.1: subgroup 1) or two weeks of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and FLU 1200 mg/day (339 participants, 1 study, Analysis 6.1: subgroup 1).Three studies compared induction with two weeks of AmBd and 5FC versus two or more weeks of AmBd alone.The study from Thailand used a low dose of FLU (400 mg/day) combined with AmBd, and the study from the USA and Thailand had one intervention with a low dose (400 mg/day) and one with a higher dose (800 mg/day) of FLU with AmBd.The study from Vietnam administered FLU at 800 mg/day.Considering only participants who received AmBd with high‐dose FLU (the currently recommended dose of 800 mg/day or higher) versus AmBd alone, again no significant difference in mortality was observed at two weeks, 10 weeks, or six months.The South African study randomized participants to receive FLU 800 mg/day (22 participants), FLU 1200 mg/day (23 participants), or voriconazole 600 mg/day (13 participants) combined with AmBd, with azole therapies combined in the analysis.The Vietnam and multisite studies used FLU doses of 800 mg/day and 1200 mg/day, respectively.The Thailand study randomized some participants to low‐dose FLU (400 mg/day).There was no difference in rate of fungal clearance comparing one week of AmBd and FLU to two weeks of AmBd and FLU (175 participants, 1 study, Analysis 11.2).One week of AmBd and FLU was associated with no difference in grade three or four toxicities compared to two weeks of AmBd and 5FC (225 participants, 1 study, Analysis 11.3) or AmBd and FLU (226 participants, 1 study, Analysis 12.3).One small study at a single centre in Malawi compared two weeks of 5FC 100 mg/kg/day in four divided doses and FLU 1200 mg/day to two weeks of FLU 1200 mg/day (Nussbaum 2010).One small study from the Netherlands and Australia randomized 28 participants to three weeks of L‐AmB 4 mg/kg/day or three weeks of AmBd 0.7 mg/kg/day followed by FLU 400 mg/day consolidation (Leenders 1997).All participants received FLU 1200 mg/day for two weeks followed by 800 mg/day consolidation.A larger phase three study is underway that will compare a single 10 mg/kg dose of L‐AmB and two weeks of 5FC 100 mg/kg/day and FLU 1200 mg/day with one week of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day and 5FC 100 mg/kg/day followed by FLU 1200 mg/day on days 8 to 14.One small study conducted at a single centre in Thailand compared a three‐drug induction regimen of two weeks of AmBd 0.7 mg/kg/day, 5FC 100 mg/kg/day, and FLU 400 mg/kg/day with: (i) two weeks of AmBd 0.7 mg/kg/day and 5FC 100 mg/kg/day, (ii) two weeks of AmBd 0.7 mg/kg/day and FLU 400 mg/day, and (iii) two weeks of AmBd 0.7 mg/kg/day (Brouwer 2004).One small study conducted at a single centre in Malawi compared a three‐drug induction regimen of one week of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day with two weeks of 5FC 100 mg/kg/day and FLU 1200 mg/day, and one week of AmBd 1 mg/kg/day with two weeks of FLU 1200 mg/day (Jackson 2012).Both regimens were followed by FLU 800 mg/day consolidation.In the Jackson 2012 study, no difference in mortality was observed between groups within two weeks or 10 weeks (40 participants, 1 study, Analysis 20.1, Table 20: subgroups 1 and 2; low‐certainty evidence).The risk of events did not differ between the one week of AmBd and 5FC and FLU group and the one week of AmBd and FLU group in the Jackson 2012 study (40 participants, 1 study, Analysis 20.3).We downgraded one comparison (two weeks of FLU versus two weeks of 5FC and FLU) due to high loss to follow‐up in one of two studies included in the comparison.Based on moderate‐certainty evidence, no difference in mortality was observed with two weeks of oral 5FC and FLU compared to two weeks of AmBd and 5FC.

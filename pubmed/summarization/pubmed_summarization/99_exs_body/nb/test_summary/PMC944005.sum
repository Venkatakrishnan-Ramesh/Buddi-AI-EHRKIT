The study included 746 children, of whom 30% were infected with parasites.For example, the prevalence of Giardia decreased from 23.5% to 8% for children of mothers with little education to those with higher education, respectively.The target population of this study was the children under 10 years of age living in the 14 neighborhoods previously selected.In each registered family, all children under 10 years of age were included in the study.The population was young in accordance with the whole population of Madagascar, and only 22.9% of the families didn't have children under 5 years of age.The average numbers of children under 10 years of age and under 5 years of age were 2.8 (SD 1.5) and 1.7 (SD 0.8) respectively.The educational level of mothers had a major impact on the prevalence of parasites in children.The age of the child (considered as the square of age in year) was a risk factor for contamination.The risk also increased for children with mother without education.This prevalence of Giardia decreased when the mother's level of education was high.The prevalence of Giardia parasite was also higher in the very poor and poor quintiles of households.

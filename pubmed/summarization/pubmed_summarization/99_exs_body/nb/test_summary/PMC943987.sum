We have developed the following criteria for LD placement in patients with SWMs such that LDs are preoperatively placed in patients with tumors with one or more of the following criteria: (1) medial location along the sphenoid wing, (2) vascular encasement resulting in obliteration of the optic carotid cistern and/or proximal sylvian fissure, and/or (3) the presence of associated edema.CSF release, after craniotomy and sphenoid wing removal, allowed for optimization of exposure, leading to the maximal safe extent of tumor resection without brain retraction or any complications.Sphenoid wing meningiomas (SWMs) pose surgical challenges given their location and common encasement of critical neurovascular structures, such as the carotid arteries, optic nerve and chiasm, as well as their frequent invasion of the skull base and its structures (i.e., cavernous sinus and orbit).We evaluate preoperative imaging to determine whether we can access and open local cisterns early in surgery to release CSF intraoperatively to facilitate brain relaxation and tumor removal.Tumors that are more medially located, with encasement of vasculature, suggest that the optic carotid cistern and proximal sylvian fissure are likely to be obliterated by tumor and thus the options for robust CSF cisternal drainage and subsequent brain relaxation will be limited.As tumor exposure is gained, by the initial CSF drainage and then tumor debulking, critical neurovascular structures are then identified either within the tumor, as well as by finding normal anatomy beyond the tumor.With regard to EOR, five patients underwent gross total resection, while five had small residual tumor left in the cavernous sinus or adherent to the carotid artery and/or optic nerve that could not be safely removed (.This ultimately allowed for tumor debulking and local CSF release, which enabled removal of the tumor in its entirety from the optic nerve, carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, and the bifurcation.

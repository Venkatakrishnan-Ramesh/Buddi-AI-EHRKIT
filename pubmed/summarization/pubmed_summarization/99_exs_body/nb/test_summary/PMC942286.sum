there were no intervention-related serious adverse events; and more time in rehabilitation did not affect the risk of serious adverse events or death immediately after intervention (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.85; P = 0.68; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 379 people with stroke; low-certainty evidence), and at medium-term (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.76; P = 0.46; I2 = 3%; 3 studies, 344 people with stroke; very low-certainty evidence).There is very low certainty about whether the amount of time spent in rehabilitation makes any difference in ADL outcomes (immediately and at medium-term after intervention), activity measures of the upper limb (immediately and at medium-term after intervention), activity measures of the lower limb (at medium-term after intervention), motor impairment measures of the upper limb (at medium-term after intervention), motor impairment measures of the lower limb (at medium-term after intervention), and serious adverse events (at medium-term after intervention).

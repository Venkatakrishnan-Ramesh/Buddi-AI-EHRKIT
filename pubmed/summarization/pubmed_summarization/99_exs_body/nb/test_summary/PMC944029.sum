(F) Western blot analysis of GINS1 expression in GINS1-overexpressing A172 cells.GINS1 overexpression in A172 cells significantly increased the stability of TOP2A (FigureÂ 5K).The role of GINS1 in TOP2A ubiquitination was further identified.(E) WB analysis of TOP2A and USP15 expression in GINS1-silenced U251 cells and GINS1-overexpressing A172 cells.(O and P) Stable GINS1 overexpression (A172-GINS1) cells were transfected with TOP2A shRNA, and stable GINS1 knockdown (U251-shRNA) cells were transfected with TOP2A cDNA.(O and P) Stable GINS1 overexpression (A172-GINS1) cells were transfected with TOP2A shRNA, and stable GINS1 knockdown (U251-shRNA) cells were transfected with TOP2A cDNA.TOP2A shRNA impaired cell proliferation in GINS1-overexpressing A172 cells.(F) Western blot analysis of the protein levels of GINS1, TOP2A, and USP15 in GINS1-overexpressing A172 cells transfected with USP15 cDNA.(F) Western blot analysis of the protein levels of GINS1, TOP2A, and USP15 in GINS1-overexpressing A172 cells transfected with USP15 cDNA.GINS1 physically interacts with TOP2A, and TOP2A physically interacts with USP15.GINS1 physically interacts with TOP2A, and TOP2A physically interacts with USP15.

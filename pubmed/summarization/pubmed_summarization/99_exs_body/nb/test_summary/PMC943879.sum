Staphylococcus argenteus is a new species classified as part of the Staphylococcus aureus-related complex in 2015 and has been recognized to be as pathogenic as S. aureus.We describe the first case of endocarditis caused by S. argenteus.Genetic analysis revealed the isolated strain as S. argenteus (sequence type 1223).Although distinguishing S. argenteus from S. aureus using routine conventional laboratory tests is difficult, the updated library version of MALDI-TOF MS is useful in identifying S. argenteus.Interestingly, all published cases of infection caused by ST1223 have been reported in Japan.He also had a 2-day history of fever.Although he had no risk factors for stroke, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed cortical convexity subarachnoid hemorrhages (cSAH) of the left frontal lobe, in addition to multiple subcortical hemorrhages in the right frontal lobe and left occipital lobe (Figure 1A and B).MALDI-TOF MS (MALDI Biotyper ver.We encountered a case of severe IE caused by S. argenteus that was complicated by cSAH and multiple brain infarctions.We screened whether the patient had colonization of S. argenteus in the nasal cavity, since the carriage of S. aureus is a risk factor for S. aureus infection.17 However, S. argenteus was not cultured from the nasal swab specimen in the present patient.Previously, S. argenteus was considered less virulent than S. aureus because of a lack of staphyloxanthin that works as an antioxidant agent against reactive oxygen species produced by the infected host immune mechanism, inducing evasion from the protective system.19 However, including the present case, many fatal infectious cases caused by S. argenteus have been reported in both community and hospital-acquired situations worldwide.2–5 Chen et al reported that the mortality related to bacteremia due to S. argenteus was higher than that due to S. aureus using multivariate analysis [adjusted hazard ratio = 1.845, 95% confidence interval 1.033–3.294].20 Therefore, when encountering a patient with S. argenteus infection, clinicians should follow the clinical course carefully, considering this pathogen causes invasive infection similar to S. aureus.Notably, the condition of the patient in the present case was complicated by cSAH.Although the specific mechanism by which IE causes cSAH is not well understood, several previous studies have revealed that cSAH is associated with IE.21–23 In a retrospective study including 240 IE patients, Boukobza et al reported 31 IE cases (13%) with complicated cSAH that frequently occurred in middle-aged patients.ST2250 of S. argenteus is the most frequently isolated clone worldwide,1 and many invasive clinical cases, such as aortic mycotic aneurysm, purulent lymphadenitis, infection of the prosthetic joint, bacteremia, and catheter-related bloodstream infection, caused by ST2250 have been reported.5,8,9,27,28 Although ST1223 is also one of the major clinically isolated strains, infectious cases due to S. argenteus ST1223 are scarce.Second, although this is the first report of IE caused by S. argenteus, we could not explain why S. argenteus caused IE in this case.Further investigation is needed to elucidate the epidemiology and clinical features, including what kinds of infections are more likely, and the ST of invasive infections due to S. argenteus.We report a case of IE caused by S. argenteus.

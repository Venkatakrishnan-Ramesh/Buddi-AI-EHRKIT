The cells most likely constitute a population of mature stem cells with the ability to compensate for the loss of TM and/or corneal endothelial cells.Diala W. Abu-Hasan et al, 20143Proving that trabecular meshwork (TM) cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can replace lost cells and restore the homeostatic function of intraocular pressure and show that stem cells have regenerative potential to restore tissue function.ExperimentalThere is a close relationship between the loss of cells in the eye tissue and the disruption of the homeostatic function of intraocular pressure.Glaucoma is characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells.The first stem cells are embryonic stem cells or multipotent cells found in blastocysts, while the second stem cells are adult stem cells or pluripotent cells that can be found in a wide variety of adult tissues.23.The research conducted successfully isolates cultures and confirms that the trabecular meshwork stem cells around the Schwalbe line are multipotent with the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of cells, including trabecular meshwork cells adipocytes osteocytes, and chondrocytes.28 Other studies have also been able to induce stem cells on the Schwalbe line trabecular meshwork to proliferate and differentiate into photoreceptors under certain conditions.29 Apart from trabecular meshwork stem cells, other stem cells that can differentiate into functional meshwork trabecular cells are adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), and iPS.iPS cells can also differentiate into trabecular meshwork cells after culturing the extracellular matrix with cell-derived trabecular meshwork.One of the significant challenges in stem cell therapy is to achieve the differentiation of stem cells into the desired cells, in this case, the differentiation of stem cells to retinal ganglion cells.The stem cells are used in cases of glaucoma, which require repair and regeneration of trabecular meshwork cells and retinal ganglion cells.iPS has been shown the ability to differentiate to replace damaged trabecular meshwork cells and retinal ganglion cells in glaucoma.Some modifications are required so that stem cells that have differentiated into trabecular meshwork cells and retinal ganglion cells can reach the central nervous system.

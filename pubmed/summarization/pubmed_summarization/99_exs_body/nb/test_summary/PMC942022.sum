The present study mainly aimed to prepare solid dispersions (SDs) of a poorly water-soluble compound, carvedilol (CA), in the presence of pluronic F68 (F68) and myrj 52 by wet milling technique in order to enhance drug dissolution.SDs with different CA: surfactant ratios were prepared by wet milling followed by freeze-drying method and evaluated for their particle size and dissolution.The significant drug dissolution and saturated solubility enhancement were recorded for milled SD formulations.The particle size reduction, improved wettability of drug particles in hydrophilic carrier, and drug change from crystalline to amorphous solid state have been identified as some relevant factors responsible for solubility and dissolution rate enhancement of API using SDs (4).The present study aimed to investigate the effect of two type of surfactants, pluronic F68 and myrj 52, on dissolution enhancement and physical properties of CA-containing SDs prepared by wet milling technique followed by freeze-drying.The value of d50 for all wet milled samples and their dried forms were decreased significantly (P < 0.01) compared to those of the intact drug and the milled drug without any additive (CAM).Seemingly, the wet milling of the drug without using surfactant and its freeze-drying in the absence (CAM) or presence of mannitol (CM) enhanced the drug dissolution by 30-50% during the first 30 min.From dissolution profiles it was understood that the incorporation of F68 in the formulations improved the drug dissolution significantly compared to the intact CA, which was more pronounced for wet milled samples rather than for PMs (P < 0.001).The enhanced dissolution of wet milled SD formulations may have been associated with factors other than the reduced particle size.The diffraction peaks with the same position as that for CA with lower intensities were observed for CAM (milled drug without additive), indicating partial conversion from crystalline to amorphous form during wet milling process.The drug solubilities of wet milled samples were about 2.6 and 5 times as large as those of CAM and CA, respectively (P < 0.001).In addition to the lower particle size as well as a better solubility obtained in the presence of both myrj and F68, the partial amorphization of CA particles, induced by milling-drying process, was detected to effectively contribute to the improvement of dissolution rate and worthy of due attention.

Key players are the consumers and patients who consume the drugs, the pharmaceutical companies who develop and manufacture the drugs, the healthcare providers and researchers who administer and monitor the drugs and, central to the process, the regulatory agencies who are responsible for overseeing the drug approval process from clinical trials through post-market surveillance.For post-market surveillance, pharmaceutical companies must provide and maintain appropriate drug product labels, and they are required to report adverse drug events (ADEs) to the appropriate regulatory agency, including reports from the literature.The applications also span multiple languages and different data sources [electronic health records (EHRs), journal publications, toxicology reports, patient safety reports, drug labels and SM] and may have specific requirements regarding data access, privacy, output encoding or detecting rare events.Previous BioCreative workshops included related evaluations: the first chemical entity and drug mention detection track took place at BioCreative IV (the CHEMDNER track) (5), motivated by the need for more efficient and quality-evaluated chemical entity recognition tools for toxicology text mining applications in the context of the eTOX project (6).Medical chemistry and toxicology experts require text mining solutions that not only support chemical named-entity recognition and text query searches but also enable chemical compound structure search capabilities that require sophisticated name-to-structure conversion components, optical chemical structure recognition tools as well as chemical data integration and harmonization strategies (42).Moreover, chemically induced AEs are described in the scientific literature in terms of traditional drug safety and toxicology studies; these are also a valuable information source for experimentally induced toxicity studies trying to examine the protective effect of certain substances, for instance with respect to hepatotoxicity (43).When extracting information from EHRs or case reports for purposes of detecting possible ADRs, it is important to capture specifics about all the patient’s medications (and dosing information), as well as signs, symptoms, lab values and medical conditions—and the timeline that connects these, since a patient may be on multiple medications for different medical conditions.In other contexts such as drug product labels, where the label concerns a specific drug and certain sections of the drug product label are devoted to listing adverse reactions, extraction of ADRs can be treated more simply as a concept extraction problem—although there is still potential ambiguity between other medical conditions such as indications or pre-existing conditions.

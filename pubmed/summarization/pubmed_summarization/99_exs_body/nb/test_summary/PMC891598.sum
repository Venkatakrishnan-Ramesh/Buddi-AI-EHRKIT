1A).Previous analysis showed that the levels of chromosomally encoded AzuC-SPA were higher in cells grown in minimal medium with glucose compared to glycerol, as well as in pH 5.5 compared to pH 7.5, and decreased under anerobic conditions (17).3A).5A).To determine if base-pairing activity reciprocally interferes with translation, we examined the levels of chromosomally encoded AzuC-SPA upon overexpression of the base-pairing regions of cadA and galE or control regions of these genes not predicted to base pair with AzuCR.6A).1A).6A).

The statistical analysis also included patient age, sex, ASA status and preanaesthesia and premanoeuvre heart rate and blood pressure.Data from 42 patients were analysed.Oculocardiac reflex was observed in 32 patients (76.2%).There was no relationship between the incidence of the OCR and the analysed parameters.The prediction of OCR based on initial ANS tone was not possible, and the initial heart rate, blood pressure, age, sex, and ASA status were not helpful for the identification of patients at risk of this reflex.The aim of this study was to determine whether it is possible to predict the occurrence of clinical exponents of the oculocardiac reflex by ANS tone, as determined by noninvasive electrocardiography Holter monitoring.The initial heart rate, blood pressure, as well as some demographic parameters were analysed.The study population comprised patients undergoing an episcleral buckling procedure for retinal detachment, under general anaesthesia.No relationship between the occurrence of the reflex and initial ANS tone, heart rate, blood pressure, age, sex, and American Society of Anesthesiologists status was found.The outcome was the incidence of OCR.OCR occurred in 32 (76.2%) patients.In the three patients with asystole, there was no recording of blood pressure during OCR.Hypotension during the OCR was observed only in four patients.a“1” refers to measurement of the parameters before the induction of anaesthesia; “2” refers to the measurement of the parameters for surgical eyeball traction.a“1” refers to measurement of the parameters before the induction of anaesthesia “2” refers to the measurement of the parameters for surgical eyeball traction.The main finding of this study is the lack of a correlation between the occurrence of OCR and the patient’s ANS tone measured before anaesthesia induction and before eyeball traction.In our study, all of the patients were Caucasian.

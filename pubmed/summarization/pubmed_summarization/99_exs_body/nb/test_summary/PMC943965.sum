The aim of this study is to describe a group of Romanian children with periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and cervical adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome.This consisted of 39 children diagnosed with PFAPA syndrome according to Thomas’ criteria (eight patients with an age at diagnosis <1 year and 31 patients with an age at diagnosis >1 year).Retrospective analysis of the patients with PFAPA syndrome was focused on clinical features, laboratory findings and therapeutic methods.The median diagnosis delay was 2.42 years.The patients presented pharyngitis (100%), adenitis (94.8%) and aphthous lesions (66.7%).The patients had a favorable response to corticosteroids.Initially, PFAPA syndrome was considered a sporadic disease, but several case studies have reported familial clustering, suggesting a possible hereditary component.6,7 The genetic origin of PFAPA syndrome is a matter of debate, with several studies suggesting that inflammasome-related genes might be involved in this autoinflammatory syndrome.8–13 The pathogenesis is not known exactly, but a defect in the regulation of the inflammatory response by innate immune pathways and adaptive immune response are involved, as suggested by activation of Th1 of CD4+ cells.14 Studies on cytokines have revealed a significant increase of serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels during the flares, a reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokine levels and a dysregulation of IL-1b monocyte production, which has a pivotal role.11,15,16 Interference with monomeric CRP’s anti-inflammatory effect activity and significant alteration of neutrophil functions have also been described.17.From a group of 44 patients diagnosed in our centre with PFAPA syndrome, 39 patients met the criteria for inclusion in this study.Depending on age of onset of the symptoms, the patients were divided into two groups: group 1 – patients with age at onset below 1 year (8 patients) and group 2 – patients with age at onset above 1 year (31 patients).The mean duration of fever episodes (4.1 days) and the mean interval between flares (5 weeks) resembles those described by other studies.27,33,34,37,39 In our cohort, the younger the age at diagnosis, the shorter the asymptomatic interval between flares (27 days vs 38 days), another finding that has been reported by other studies.39,40 On the other hand, a comparison between the clinical presentation of paediatric and adult patients with PFAPA has found that the frequency of the flares was significantly higher in paediatric cases, while febrile attack duration was significantly longer in adults.22,41.Recent publications have proposed simplified criteria consisted of regular fever episodes without any other explanation, even in the absence of pharyngitis, aphthous stomatitis or cervical adenitis, and also in children older than 5 years.42 An online survey for paediatric rheumatologists and infectious disease specialists assessing PFAPA diagnostic criteria has shown that signs of aphthous stomatitis, adenitis, or pharyngitis are not required as long as regular fever episodes with asymptomatic intervals between episodes and normal growth and development are present.43 Erythematous pharyngitis was present in all our patients and exudative pharyngitis in 18%.A family history of recurrent pharyngitis (in first or second-degree relatives) in our group was lower (10.2%) than in other studies which noted a higher incidence (range between 23% and 52%).31–35 A previous case–control study comparing the family history of PFAPA patients with healthy controls subjects found that first-degree relatives (parents and siblings) of patients with PFAPA syndrome have a higher prevalence of recurrent pharyngitis and aphthous stomatitis than relatives of control subjects, suggesting that these disorders could represent reduced penetrance phenotypes of PFAPA determined by an inherited genetic predisposition and/or common environmental exposure.35 These findings raise the possibility of the involvement of genetic factors in PFAPA syndrome etiopathogenesis.PFAPA syndrome is a benign but troublesome disease.

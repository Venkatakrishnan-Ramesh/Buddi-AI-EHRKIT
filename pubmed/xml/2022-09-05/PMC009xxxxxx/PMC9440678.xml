<disp-quote><p>a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film, and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p></disp-quote></p><p>Based on etiology, DED can be classified as aqueous tear deficiency, evaporative tear deficiency, or a combination of both. According to a report by the Tear Film &#x00026; Ocular Surface Society Dry Eye Workshop in 2017, evaporative DED is more common than aqueous-deficiency DED.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Evaporative DED results from excessive loss of water due to exposed ocular surface despite normal lacrimal secretion. Consequently, a vicious cycle is generated, in which tear hyperosmolarity develops and activates inflammation response that contributes to tear film instability, further exacerbating tear hyperosmolarity. Etiologies of evaporative DED include meibomian gland deficiency (MGD), poor lid dynamic, low blink rate, systemic retinoids use, preservatives use, contact lens, vitamin A deficiency, etc. The most common cause for evaporative DED is MGD which causes disruption of the tear lipid layers.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Chronic glandular inflammation, meibum thickening, gland channel terminal duct obstruction, and glandular atrophy associated with MGD lead to altered meibomian gland secretions and tear film instability. A treatment approach for MGD by restoring meibomian gland function and natural flow of meibum has potential therapeutic relief for DED signs and symptoms.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Three commonly used products for DED are available in the United States, targeting the inflammatory aspects of the disease: Restasis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Xiidra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, CEQUA&#x02122;. However, these currently approved pharmacologic treatments for DED are associated with delayed onset of action for both DED sign and symptom improvements. Clinical experiences reported at least 6 weeks for improved signs and 12 weeks for symptom relief with Xiidra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 21 weeks for improved signs with Restasis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and 12 weeks for improved signs with CEQUA&#x02122;.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> It is evident that data for DED symptom improvements with current therapies are limited, and there exists a therapeutic need for faster onset treatments.</p><p>Meanwhile, MGD treatment mainly begins from eyelid warming, eyelid massaging, and progresses to the uses of topical lubricants, topical and systemic antibiotics with anti-inflammatory properties, and topical steroids. A number of devices have been developed for eyelid warming to optimize efficacy and compliance with faster onset of action such as LipiFlow and TearCare systems. The LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation System (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson Vision, Milpitas, CA, USA), indicated for adult patients with MGD, can safely heat the palpebral surfaces of the upper and lower eyelids while applying graded pulsatile pressure to the outer surface. An open label, randomized, crossover study in 139 subjects demonstrated that a single 12-minute treatment with LipiFlow maintained improvement in both signs and symptoms over the 4-week study.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The TearCare System (Sight Sciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA), a class II exempt device listed with the FDA for the application of warm compress to eyelids, delivers controlled, precise heat to the tarsal plates and underlying meibomian glands for 15 minutes followed by manual mechanical meibomian gland expression. The TearCare system allows subjects to blink naturally thanks to the flexible SmartLid devices applied to the upper and lower eyelid surfaces. The SmartHub component of the TearCare system provided adjustable temperature ranging from 41 to 45 &#x000b0;C for subject comfort.</p><p>Previous study in 2017 on 24 subjects demonstrated that the TearCare System significantly improved tear film break-up time (TFBUT), meibomian secretion, corneal and conjunctival staining scores, and dry eye symptom questionnaires at 1-month follow-up and maintained these outcomes out to 6 months<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and 12 months.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The outcomes were further validated in multicenter studies concluded in 2018<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and 2019.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This report aims to highlight DED symptom improvement efficacy results of TearCare from an unpublished clinical report of OLYMPIA study on 235 subjects and its post-hoc subgroup analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Study Design</title><p>OLYMPIA study was a randomized, single-masked, multicenter, non-inferiority, post-market study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a single TearCare treatment compared to a single LipiFlow treatment for improving signs and symptoms of DED associated with MGD. The study was approved by the institutional review board (Aspire IRB) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. After explanation of the study was given, subjects with DED who were &#x02265;22 years of age and provided informed consent were randomized 1:1 to receive one in-office treatment of either the TearCare system or LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation on study day 0. Subjects could not be masked due to apparent treatment design. Subjects must have Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score of 23&#x02013;79, TFBUT of &#x02264;7 seconds in both eyes, and best corrected visual acuity of 20/100 or better in both eyes. At least 15 glands in each lower eyelid should be expressible, and total Meibomian Gland Secretion Score (MGSS) must be &#x02264;12 in each eye.</p><p>Study staff performing endpoint assessments were masked to the subject&#x02019;s treatment arm. The study comprised 4 visits: Baseline, Treatment (if not at Baseline Visit), Day 1, Week 2, and Month 1. Within the 1-month follow-up, subjects refrained from using any dry eye drops, lubricants, or other type of dry eye treatment (eg warm compresses, prescription medication, etc.). If they required &#x0201c;rescue therapy&#x0201d; for relieve symptoms, they could use the same type of drops or lubricants they were using prior to the study and recorded any use in the Dry Eye Lubricant/Drop Log.</p><p>In this study, DED symptoms were assessed as secondary endpoints using the Eye Dryness (ED) score, mean change from baseline in OSDI score, and mean change from baseline in Symptom Assessment in Dry Eye (SANDE) scores.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2002"><title>Symptom Endpoint Assessments</title><sec id="s0002-s2002-s3001"><title>OSDI</title><p>The OSDI questionnaire is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring dry eye symptoms (normal, mild to moderate, and severe) and its effect on vision-related functions. The investigator asked subjects 12 questions which were categorized into three subsections: Section A (ocular symptoms), Section B (vision-related functions), and Section C (environmental triggers). The OSDI was assessed on a scale of 0 to 100 with higher score representing greater disability. The 5-unit scale for responses to the OSDI was given by the following: 0 = None of the time, 1 = Some of the time, 2 = Half of the time, 3 = Most of the time, and 4 = All of the time. The total OSDI score was calculated by the following:

Subjects treated with TearCare achieved similar reduction compared to the active-control, LipiFlow, in total OSDI score, total SANDE score, and ED score for all randomized subjects. Post-hoc subgroup analysis in the less severe group and more severe group based on median MGSS provided further understanding of the treatment effect favoring TearCare for DED symptom improvement. Subjects with more severe meibomian gland dysfunction achieved greater significant improvements in total OSDI, OSDI subsection focusing on quality of vision, and SANDE frequency score with TearCare in comparison to LipiFlow. Results of other assessments including OSDI subsections on ocular symptoms and environmental triggers, total SANDE score, SANDE severity score, and ED score also trended toward more reduction with TearCare although statistical significance was not attained. These results suggested that TearCare not only is beneficial for all patients regardless of MGD severity but also can offer additional meaningful DED symptom relief to the subjects with more severe blockages in the meibomian gland. For subjects with less severe blockage in the meibomian gland, both LipiFlow and TearCare presented as effective treatments since the two devices significantly reduced the total OSDI score, OSDI subsection scores, total SANDE score, and SANDE score for severity and frequency from baseline.</p><p>Maintaining a healthy lipid layer plays a critical role in preventing evaporative DED.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The TearCare system delivers precise heat to the tarsal plates of upper and lower eyelids and meibomian glands with the SmartHub controller, and facilitates the manual expression of subjects&#x02019; meibomian glands with its Clearance Assistant units to enhance the natural flow of lipids. LipiFlow system uses a Console and a single-use sterile device called Activator to apply heat to the palpebral surfaces of the upper and lower eyelids directly over the meibomian glands after a local anesthetic drop is instilled. Simultaneously, graded pulsatile pressure is applied to the outer eyelid surfaces, thereby expressing the meibomian glands in closed eyes during heating. The TearCare system delivers to the outer eyelid surfaces and thus allows normal blinking with its SmartLid units and does not use an initial anesthetic drop. Both systems utilize heat and pressure applications as the mechanism of action; however, all applications are embedded in one system with LipiFlow while with TearCare, there is an additional unit used to further express the meibomian gland manually by clinicians. The mechanisms described in both devices helps tear film to recover as the gland blockage is cleared. Consequently, DED improves as demonstrated by positive outcomes in DED symptom assessments presented here and also in DED sign assessments such as TFBUT, fluorescein staining, etc. in earlier studies.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>This study provided reliable data in terms of symptom evaluations with different assessment tools. Previous efficacy data on symptom improvements were limited as the majority of currently available DED treatments such as Restasis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Xiidra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and CEQUA&#x02122; were mostly approved based on sign efficacy endpoints.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> Here, symptom improvements are highlighted across multiple reliable assessment measurements. Consistent results supporting TearCare efficacy were observed in not only ED score, overall SANDE score, and OSDI but also in each subsection of the SANDE questionnaire (frequency and severity) and OSDI questionnaire (ocular symptoms, vision-related functions, environmental triggers) for both the analysis in all randomized subjects and in subgroups. Utilizing multiple questionnaires offers additional benefits because besides symptom assessment, and some questionnaires such as OSDI also incorporate quality of life measures that can capture patient perspectives on treatment effectiveness more comprehensively. Such questionnaires are highly encouraged as the US Federal Food and Drug Administration promoted the use of patient-reported outcomes to support clinical trials and product submissions. Based on this report, TearCare successfully provided clinically meaningful improvements in both dry eye symptoms and vision-related functions to have positive impact on patients&#x02019; lives.</p><p>In addition, delayed onset of action of several months associated with currently available anti-inflammatory treatments is the most prevalent factor leading to low treatment satisfaction in both physicians and patients.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A study in 2020 reported that only 10% and 48% of physicians were satisfied with the onset of action for cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% and lifitegrast 5% ophthalmic solution, respectively.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Similarly, patients also perceived low satisfaction with onset of action for current treatments: only 51% of patients on cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion and 63% of patients on lifitegrast ophthalmic solution reported being satisfied.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Low level of satisfaction can negatively affect overall treatment compliance and effectiveness. Therefore, DED treatment options with faster onset are needed. In this study, TearCare demonstrated remarkable onset of action for symptom relief at 1-month follow-up. This result aligns well with previously reported efficacy studies in TearCare. Prior studies proved TearCare to be more effective than warm compress in improving both DED signs and symptoms at 1-month timepoint and maintaining such effects for up to 6 and 12 months.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> An exploratory study in 2020 described significant improvements in OSDI achieved with TearCare as early as at 1-week follow-up visit and continued to improve further at 1-month visit.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Early onset of action is a notable advantage that sets TearCare apart as an effective treatment option for DED. One limitation of this current study is the short follow-up duration of 1 month.</p><p>In summary, both LipiFlow and the TearCare system consistently improved DED symptoms assessed by total OSDI, SANDE, and Eye Dryness score from baseline. Furthermore, the subject population with severe gland obstructions and in need for a better gland clearance, achieved greater meaningful symptom relief with TearCare in comparison to LipiFlow. In subjects with more severe meibomian gland dysfunction, TearCare provided better improvements in overall symptom relief, vision-related functions, and DED symptom frequency expressed by total OSDI score, OSDI Section B score, and SANDE frequency score. With the benefits of fast action onset and excellent efficacy in symptomatic relief, the TearCare system presents as a compelling option for DED treatment among currently available treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Garrick Wallstrom, PhD at Statistics &#x00026; Data Corporation for statistical analyses support.</p></ack><sec id="s0005"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>OSDI, Ocular Surface Disease Index; TBUT, Tear-film Break-Up Time; MGSS, Meibomian Gland Secretion Score; MGD, Meibomian Gland Dysfunction; CI, Confidence Intervals; DED, Dry Eye Disease; SANDE, Symptom Assessment In Dry Eye.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>The authors do not intend to share participant-level data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0007"><title>Disclosure</title><p>Kavita Dhamdhere is an employee of Sight Sciences, Inc.

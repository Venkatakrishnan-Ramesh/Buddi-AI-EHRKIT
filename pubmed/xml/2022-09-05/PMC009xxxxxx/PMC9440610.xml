We asked whether the two phenomena shared perceptual mechanisms. We modified the standard &#x0201c;priming of pop-out&#x0201d; paradigm to measure both priming and serial dependence concurrently. The stimulus comprised three grating patches, one or two red, and the other green. Participants identified the color singleton (either red or green), and reproduced its orientation. Trial sequences were designed to maximize serial dependence, and long runs of priming color and position. The results showed strong effects of priming, both on reaction times and accuracy, which accumulated steadily over time, as generally reported in the literature. The serial dependence effects were also strong, but did not depend on previous color, nor on the run length. Reaction times measured under various conditions of repetition or change of priming color or position were reliably correlated with imprecision in orientation reproduction, but reliably uncorrelated with magnitude of serial dependence. The results suggest that visual priming and serial dependence are mediated by different neural mechanisms.

One important factor that may mediate stability is that most of the objects surrounding us change little over time, at least in the short term, so the brain can usefully incorporate recent sensory history into the current perceptual model. Recently, the use of contextual information has been discussed in terms of Bayes theory, where the contextual information based on recent sensory history is referred to as the <italic toggle="yes">prior</italic> (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gregory, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Kersten, Mamassian, &#x00026; Yuille, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mamassian, Landy, &#x00026; Maloney, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The construction of priors can improve perception efficiency, by using efficient hierarchical generative strategies, such as predictive coding (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Friston, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Rao &#x00026; Ballard, 1999</xref>). This approach increases perceptual efficiency, but can bias perception toward the statistics of previous percepts. Thus, perception includes both current sensory input and contextual priors, leading to a phenomenon referred to as <italic toggle="yes">serial dependence</italic>, a type of <italic toggle="yes">serial effect</italic>. Such effects have now been demonstrated for a wide range of stimuli and tasks: orientation judgments (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fischer &#x00026; Whitney, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Liberman, Zhang, &#x00026; Whitney, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Manassi, Liberman, Chaney, &#x00026; Whitney, 2017</xref>), numerosity (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cicchini, Anobile, &#x00026; Burr, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Corbett, Fischer, &#x00026; Whitney, 2011</xref>), expressions and facial gender (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Kondo, Takahashi, &#x00026; Watanabe, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Liberman, Fischer, &#x00026; Whitney, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Xia, Leib, &#x00026; Whitney, 2016</xref>), and position (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bliss, Sun, &#x00026; D'Esposito, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Manassi, Liberman, Kosovicheva, Zhang, &#x00026; Whitney, 2018</xref>). Serial effects are modulated by attention (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fischer &#x00026; Whitney, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">John-Saaltink, Kok, Lau, &#x00026; De Lange, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Makovski &#x00026; Jiang, 2008</xref>) in that attended stimuli undergo stronger serial effects, leading some authors to hypothesize that the more attention allocated the more the influence of the past in defining current perception. In search tasks, it has also been reported that non-target items exert a negative (repulsive) effect on subsequent targets; this effect presumably is found as distractors contribute to search space and indicates that multiple forms of serial dependence can occur in parallel (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Rafiei, Chetverikov, Hansmann-Roth, &#x00026; Kristjansson, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Rafiei, Hansmann-Roth, Whitney, Kristjansson, &#x00026; Chetverikov, 2021</xref>). Interestingly, serial effects are strongest for attributes that rarely change (such as gender), and minimal for attributes that change over time (such as expression), consistent with an implicit belief on the stability of a given attribute (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Taubert, Alais, &#x00026; Burr, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The effects of perceptual history have been long studied, particularly by a technique known as <italic toggle="yes">priming</italic>, introduced by <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lashley (1951)</xref>. Priming is a phenomenon where exposure to one stimulus influences the response to a subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance of intention. Priming is an important phenomenon for a range of cognitive studies, from linguistics to social psychology, and particularly in perceptual research (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kristjansson &#x00026; Campana, 2010</xref>). Perhaps the most well-known are priming of &#x0201c;pop-out&#x0201d; studies (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Maljkovic &#x00026; Nakayama, 1994</xref>; Maljkovic &#x00026; Nakayama, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Treisman, 1992</xref>), where participants report a specific feature of a &#x0201c;pop-out&#x0201d; stimulus, defined by being the odd-one-out in some attribute, typically color. Observers responded faster to features of a color-defined target when the color was repeated from the previous trial, with the facilitation accumulating over many trials (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Maljkovic &#x00026; Nakayama, 1994</xref>). The same effect in simple pop-out search tasks has been observed for several visual features besides color, including position and orientation (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kristjansson, 2006</xref>), shape (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Fecteau, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kristjansson, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Maljkovic &#x00026; Nakayama, 1994</xref>), motion (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Campana, Pavan, &#x00026; Casco, 2008</xref>), and size (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Huang, Holcombe, &#x00026; Pashler, 2004</xref>). Priming also occurs during conjunction search tasks (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hillstrom, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Kristjansson, Wang, &#x00026; Nakayama, 2002</xref>) with separable effects for target and distractors (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kristjansson &#x00026; Driver, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we examined the relationship between priming of pop-out and serial effects to determine if they shared common mechanisms. In particular, we hypothesized that priming and serial effects should be similarly affected by feature repetition: decreasing reaction times to consecutive targets with the same feature, and increasing the serial dependence effect. To test this, we devised a paradigm to measure concurrently priming of reaction times and serial bias effects. The results fail to find evidence for a solid relationship between priming of pop-out and serial dependence, and strong evidence to suggest they tap different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixteen participants (10 women, age = 26.6 &#x000b1; 2.9), with normal or corrected-to-normal vision, took part in the experiment, and gave informed consent, following the Declaration of Helsinki.

Three Gabor stimuli with average luminance matched to the background (space constant with &#x003c3; = 0.83 degrees; spatial frequency 1 cycle per degree [cpd]; contrast = 10%; and duration = 300 ms) were shown on the vertices of an equilateral triangle, equidistant (6.14 degrees radial eccentricity) from the fixation cross. Each Gabor was followed by a mask of the same size and average luminance of the Gabor (gaussian mask with &#x003c3; = 0.83&#x000b0; vignetting the sum of 5 different black-and-white gratings, random orientations, random phases, 1 cpd, contrast = 10%, and duration = 250 ms). Observers were asked to choose the odd-colored Gabor (either a red target among 2 green distractors or vice versa), and reproduce its orientation by swiping the forefinger of the preferred hand on the trackpad, as quickly as possible (responses faster than 0.2 seconds or slower than 2 seconds were excluded from the analysis). Similar to <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994)</xref>, unbeknownst to the observer, the target appeared exclusively in one of the two lower positions of the equilateral triangle. The trackpad trajectory was displayed on-screen with visual feedback. Once the participants reported the perceived orientation, the visual feedback vanished and after a random pause between 500 and 1000 ms, a new trial began (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Gabor orientation was chosen from one of two gaussian distributions centered at &#x000b1;45 degrees with &#x003c3; = 20 degrees, (in steps of 5 degrees). Stimuli were designed so that the target and distractor stimuli had almost orthogonal orientations (clockwise and counterclockwise or vice versa). This made it possible to uniquely identify whether participants correctly recognized the odd-colored target, and score as correct or in error. By convention, vertical Gabors had orientation zero, and counterclockwise orientations were considered positive. The target color either switched or repeated on each trial with 75% probability of repeating. After a 10-trial training session, participants performed at least 15 of the 100-trial sessions (each lasting about 4 minutes).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>
<bold>Timeline and stimuli.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) The typical trial. All trials began with a fixation cross at the center of a gray background, for a random duration between 500 and 1000 ms. This was followed by the stimulus for 300 ms, which comprised three Gabor stimuli (positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, 6.14 degrees radial eccentricity) with average luminance equal to that of the background (&#x003c3; = 0.83 degrees, 1 cpd, 10% contrast). The Gabor stimuli were followed by three black and white masks for 250 ms (superimposition of 5 black and white gratings: &#x003c3; = 0.83 degrees, random orientations, random phases, 1 cpd, 10% contrast). Participants were instructed to reproduce, as quickly as possible, the orientation of the odd-colored target Gabor by swiping a forefinger to draw a trajectory on the trackpad. After the orientation, reproduction was complete, and a new trial began. (<bold>B</bold>) Orientation judgments. Reaction times were computed as the difference in time between stimulus onset and the moment in which the drawn trajectory reached a distance threshold, 200 pixels from the screen's center. Orientation judgments were estimated as the circular average of all the orientations within the segments of the trajectory with speeds higher than the 20% of the maximum speed of the whole trajectory. (<bold>C</bold>) Trial sequences and estimation of serial effects. Randomization of the color of the target with only 25% chance of change tends to lead to sequences of trials where the color of the target is repeated for several consecutive trials. Color maintenance over consecutive trials was set at 75% probability. Gabor orientations were chosen from a bimodal distribution centered at &#x000b1;45 degrees in steps of 5 degrees. To measure serial effects, we plotted single-trial reproduction errors (target orientation judgment minus physical orientation) against the relative orientation of the previous target compared to the current one.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jovi-22-10-1-f001" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analyses were performed for both the aggregate observer and single participants, on reaction times, serial effects, and standard error of the reproduction error. For the aggregate observer, we additionally analyzed the evolution of those indexes along the progression of trial sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C; i.e. as a function of the number of preceding trials with same/opposite-color target).</p><p>Accuracy was assessed confirming that the finger swipe had traced a trajectory in the same quadrant as the stimulus (e.g. if the stimulus was clockwise from vertical a correct response would have been a trajectory crossing the I and III Cartesian quadrants). This criterion enables assessing attentional deployment without the need for an extra task, and relies on the fact that when observers are not paying attention, they risk making a very large error. This approach is perfectly suitable for near oblique stimuli, but less so for near cardinal stimuli, as when the correct response approaches the boundary it is possible that a simple error due to motor planning brings to a response which crosses the boundary. For this reason (and also because we were investigating serial effects which are strongest for oblique stimuli), we excluded from the analysis trials where the target was less than 26 degrees away from the cardinals.</p><p>Reaction time was computed as the time elapsed from the presentation of the stimulus to the moment in which the finger motion over the trackpad reached a distance threshold (200 pixels;&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B, top row). We estimated the orientation reproduced from the finger trajectories from segments with speeds higher than the 20% of the maximum speed. The orientation reproduced was estimated as the circular average of all the orientations within those trajectories (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B, bottom row). Trials where reaction times were more than three median absolute deviations from their relative medians were excluded from priming effect analysis.</p><p>To measure the serial effects, the single-trial reproduction errors (orientation judgment minus physical orientation) were plotted as a function of the relative orientation of the previous trial with respect to the current trial. Reproduction errors corresponding to orientation changes between &#x000b1;35 degrees (77% of trials) were fit with a derivative of Gaussian (DoG) function of the form:

Serial effects values were estimated as the maximum value of the derivative of the DoG, which captures the maximum weight that the previous orientation can have on the current judgment. The standard deviation of the reproduction errors was calculated for the relative orientations of the current and previous trials. Given that near-cardinal orientations judgments do not inherit much past information to elicit great serial effects (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cicchini, Mikellidou, &#x00026; Burr, 2018</xref>)<italic toggle="yes">,</italic> near-cardinal targets (less than 26 degrees from the cardinal orientations) were excluded from analysis of reproduction errors (33% of total trials). However, they were included in the analysis as predictors for the following response errors.</p><p>To exclude blatant errors from the analysis, we excluded trials where either the median absolute deviation from median exceeded three or the raw reproduction error exceeded 30 degrees. Overall, this led to the exclusion of 2% of the trials. Three participants were excluded from the analysis of both serial effects and priming because they reported consistent repulsive serial effects (negative derivative of DoG fit).</p><p>When creating the aggregate observer, care was taken not to carry over individual reproduction biases. For this reason, we first estimated the individual biases for those trials where the previous was identical to the current one (this avoids any serial dependence effect) and subtracted this from each observer. Before analysis we also sought to minimize the impact of regression-to-the-mean effect (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cicchini, Arrighi, Cecchetti, Giusti, &#x00026; Burr, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Hollingworth, 1910</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jazayeri &#x00026; Shadlen, 2010</xref>), as these introduce errors for stimuli far from the mean which can be erroneously ascribed to the stimulus history that leads to those stimuli. To this end, for every orientation of the stimulus, we calculated the average orientation reproduction of that stimulus and discounted it from responses to that orientation. To have an unbiased measure of the reproduction bias free from history effect, we limited the calculation of the average bias only considering trials that had a symmetrical history of orientations (i.e. with equal opportunity of having a clockwise or counterclockwise previous stimulus). An orientation was considered to have a symmetrical history if the relative amount of clockwise and counter-clockwise trials was not below 35% or above 65%.</p><p>We investigated the correlation between reaction times and serial effects, either by looking at their values across the entire experiment, or by studying their dynamics within a given sequence of trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistics</title><p>Two-way repeated measures ANOVA were run for both reaction times and serial effects across participants (i.e. for each experimental condition, each participant yielded an average reaction time and serial effect).

Using a paradigm similar to that pioneered by <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Maljkovic &#x00026; Nakayama, 1996</xref>) we were able to demonstrate robust priming for pop-out and serial dependence within the same experiment: there was considerable speeding of responses for repeated color and spatial position, with positive and negative effects accumulating over trials; and reproduction of orientation was systematically biased toward that of the previous trial. However, the conditions that led to an increase in priming of pop-out did not lead to greater serial dependence effects. Repetition of the same feature, particularly color, speeded reaction times considerably, with the effects accumulating over many trials. However, repetition had little effect on serial dependence: indeed, repetition of position slightly decreased the magnitude of serial dependence, and repetition of color had no significant effect. Similarly, there was no measurable effect of run length on serial dependence. There was no correlation between reaction times and strength of serial dependence in the various conditions of feature repetition, and substantial Bayesian evidence in favor of lack of correlation. That the effects do not covary with the experimental manipulations strongly implies that they are mediated by different neural mechanisms.</p><p>Weaker serial dependence for targets in the same position may seem to contradict findings of a spatial tuning of the serial effect. However, all experiments which reported tuning have estimated a window larger than 10 degrees (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Collins, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Fischer &#x00026; Whitney, 2014</xref>), whereas, here, the two positions for the target are only 6.14 degrees apart. Why is the effect actually weaker? One possibility is that, because priming improves precision (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sigurdardottir, Kristjansson, &#x00026; Driver, 2008</xref>) and precise stimuli display less serial dependence (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cicchini, Mikellidou, &#x00026; Burr, 2018</xref>), the priming itself drives this decrease of serial dependence.</p><p>The total lack of correlation between the two effects was far from foregone. Both priming of pop-out and serial dependence tap some form of memory of perceptual history, which affects performance of the current trial. What mechanisms may serve the two paradigms, and in what key respects may they differ? Priming results in improved performance &#x02013; revealed either in reaction times, accuracy or precision &#x02013; whereas serial dependence results in systematic biases towards the previous targets. In Signal Detection Theory terms, priming increases sensitivity whereas serial dependence changes criteria. It seems reasonable that sensitivity and criteria, two orthogonal measures, tap different neural mechanisms, which have different properties. For example, increase of sensitivity by priming could tap attention-like mechanisms, keeping attention focused on a particular feature (color or position), with a disengagement cost when the feature changes. Changes in criteria, or bias, on the other hand, are well modeled within the Bayesian framework by weighted combination of present and past information, similar to the processes that occur in combining information from different senses. That reaction times correlated well with the precision of reproduction (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>) rather than with the bias (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>) is consistent with the idea that different measures of sensitivity share the same mechanism, even when using quite different paradigms.</p><p>Recent theoretical (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Friston, Bastos, Pinotsis, &#x00026; Litvak, 2015</xref>) and experimental work has strongly implicated neural oscillations as a putative mechanism for transmitting contextual information over time, both for vision and audition. The frequency of context-dependent oscillations varies considerably. Broadly speaking, theta frequencies (4-8 Hz) seem to be associated with changes in sensitivity, and alpha/beta (8-18 Hz) with changes in criterium. Y. <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Huang, Chen, and Luo (2015)</xref> demonstrated theta oscillations associated with visual priming, suggesting the effect of priming is conveyed over time in an alternating theta-band rhythm. In addition, sensitivity for contrast detection (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Landau &#x00026; Fries, 2012</xref>) and discrimination (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Tomassini, Spinelli, Jacono, Sandini, &#x00026; Morrone, 2015</xref>) are modulated at a similar theta frequency. On the other hand, criteria for audiovisual temporal order judgment (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Benedetto, Burr, &#x00026; Morrone, 2018</xref>), and for judging the gender of the faces (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bell, Burr, Crookes, &#x00026; Morrone, 2020</xref>) are oscillated within the alpha/beta range. In both the visual and auditory domains, different frequencies of oscillations for sensitivity and criteria have been demonstrated within the same experiment (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Benedetto &#x00026; Morrone, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ho, Burr, Alais, &#x00026; Morrone, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ho, Leung, Burr, Alais, &#x00026; Morrone, 2017</xref>). Sensitivity oscillated in the theta range, and criterion in the alpha range. Crucially, alpha oscillations have been recently linked to predictive coding mechanisms (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Alamia &#x00026; VanRullen, 2019</xref>) and to serial dependence effects (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ho, Burr, Alais, &#x00026; Morrone, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Pupillometry studies also implicate multiple mechanisms in priming. Using the <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994)</xref> paradigm, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pom&#x000e8;, Binda, Cicchini, and Burr (2020)</xref> showed that switching the priming color was associated with an increase in pupil size. However, the increase in size did not accumulate over trials, like the reaction time advantage. Furthermore, the magnitude of the pupil dilation depended on personality traits, specifically &#x0201c;autistic-like traits,&#x0201d; whereas the reaction time advantage did not, all implicating multiple mechanisms in priming. Similarly, although serial dependence effects on face identity and gender are very robust (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Liberman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Taubert et al., 2016</xref>), there appears to be no evidence for priming effects for facial recognition (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ariga &#x00026; Kawahara, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Priming is one of the most venerable phenomena in perception, going back at least to <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lashley (1951)</xref>, and is manifested over a whole range of areas, from linguistics to perception (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bargh, 2014</xref>). Serial dependence has been more recently described and studied intensely over the past 8 years. Given that priming is such a general phenomenon, it is tempting to suppose that the recently described serial dependence reflects yet another version of it, revealed by a different paradigm. However, the results of the current experiment suggest that this is not the case, but that they are two distinct processes. We suggest that a useful distinction is to consider priming to affect sensitivity (in Signal Detection terms), probably related to deployment and disengagement of attention mechanisms, whereas serial dependence reflects changes in criteria, resulting from integration with perceptual expectations. The two processes could be mediated, at least in part, by neural mechanisms, priming in the theta range (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2015</xref>), serial dependence in the alpha range (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, Grant No 832813 (GenPercept).</p><p>Commercial relationships: none.</p><p>Corresponding author: Filippo Galluzzi.</p><p>Email: filippo.galluzzi@iit.it.</p><p>Address: IIT - Center for Synaptic Neuroscience and Technology, Padiglione IST-NORD, Largo Rosanna Benzi, 10, 16132 Genova GE, Italy.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">

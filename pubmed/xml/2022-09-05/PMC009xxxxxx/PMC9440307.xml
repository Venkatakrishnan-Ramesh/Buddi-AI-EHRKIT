Further study of real-world patient populations and treatment patterns with long follow-up is needed. It would be helpful to have 5 years of follow-up, similar to that reported recently by Reck et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> from KEYNOTE-024, to observe long-term outcomes. Moreover, studies of real-world effectiveness for other NSCLC pembrolizumab indications (expanded monotherapy and in combination) that became available after the index period of this study would be of interest, including prospective studies to evaluate patient-reported outcomes associated with pembrolizumab therapy.</p><p id="p0175">In conclusion, the results of this noninterventional study complement KEYNOTE clinical trial findings and provide real-world evidence supporting the benefits of first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy for treating advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS greater than or equal to 50% and no actionable genomic alterations, including for patients who are 75 years and older.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>CRediT Authorship Contribution Statement</title><p id="p0180"><bold>Yasushi Goto:</bold> Methodology, Investigation, Resources, Writing&#x02014;review and editing, Visualization.</p><p id="p0185"><bold>Atsuhisa Tamura:</bold> Investigation, Resources, Writing&#x02014;review and editing.</p><p id="p0190"><bold>Hirotaka Matsumoto:</bold> Investigation, Resources, Writing&#x02014;review and editing.</p><p id="p0195"><bold>Kazutoshi Isobe:</bold> Investigation, Resources, Writing&#x02014;review and editing.</p><p id="p0200"><bold>Tomohiro Ozaki:</bold> Investigation, Resources, Writing&#x02014;review and editing.</p><p id="p0205"><bold>Melissa L.

</p></notes></front><body><p>I&#x02019;ve tried titrated injectable opioid therapies and none of them worked, so when they came out with the powdered fentanyl program, I thought I&#x02019;d give it a try. So far it seems to be working pretty good. I&#x02019;ve been on it for about 2 months.</p><p>You can come to SAFER [Safer Alternatives for Emergency Response program] up to 4 times a day. Sometimes I come a couple of times, sometimes all 4. Night is the only time where I&#x02019;m finding I&#x02019;m using outside of the program. They close at 4:00 pm and fentanyl&#x02019;s not a long-acting drug. I&#x02019;m also on a pretty high dose of methadone, but it doesn&#x02019;t last as long as it is supposed to. I take it at 8:00 in the morning and by 5:00 pm it&#x02019;s already worn off, so I usually have to buy something before bed. I&#x02019;m hoping that once SAFER gets the buying program started, I&#x02019;ll be able to buy something for nighttime and then I won&#x02019;t have to rely on the street stuff. They&#x02019;ll be selling points (0.1 g) for $10 apiece for home use<xref rid="b1-194e681" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> so I&#x02019;ll have something for when they close.</p><p>I have more structure. There isn&#x02019;t much reliability in trying to survive off street dope. It&#x02019;s a lot easier to have a prescription, come in when I want, and I know it&#x02019;s safe. Well, not safe. But safer. The issue is the quality of what I&#x02019;m getting on the street. You never know what they put in it. There&#x02019;s lots of benzos in the fentanyl these days. People are blacking out and stuff like that. Here, I know exactly how much I&#x02019;m getting and I know it&#x02019;s made by a pharmacy, not by someone I don&#x02019;t know.</p><p>I know the nurses and doctors pretty well here. I&#x02019;m pretty open with them &#x02014; I tell them everything I want them to know. They are all addiction-based doctors and nurses, so they have a lot of experience dealing with people who are using drugs. They don&#x02019;t attach the stigma to it too much.</p><p>SAFER is what everybody&#x02019;s been waiting for. I didn&#x02019;t think I&#x02019;d see it in my lifetime. With the whole fentanyl crisis, people are dying everywhere, all over the country, especially in British Columbia and Vancouver. Back home it&#x02019;s pretty bad, but over here people are dying every day. I&#x02019;ve had quite a few friends die. &#x02014; SAFER client</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>In Their Own Words provide extracts of interviews held between <italic>CMAJ</italic> staff and patients, families or clinicians.

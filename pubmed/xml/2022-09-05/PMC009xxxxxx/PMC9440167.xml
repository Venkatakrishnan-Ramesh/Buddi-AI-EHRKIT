It is estimated that more than 100,000 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the United States (US) in 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients with advanced disease have a poor prognosis. Based on registry data, approximately 4% of patients diagnosed with melanoma between 2010 and 2016 had distant metastases, and these patients demonstrated a 5-year survival rate of 27% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; however, this 5-year survival rate represents a marked improvement from that observed between 2003 and 2009 (16%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Treatments for advanced unresectable melanoma have changed dramatically over the last decade with the approval of non-chemotherapy systemic treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e., immuno-oncology [I-O] therapies) and targeted therapies (BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. US treatment guidelines recommend the use of the I-O therapies nivolumab (NIVO), pembrolizumab (PEMBRO), or the combination of NIVO plus ipilimumab (NIVO + IPI) regardless of <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation status as first-line treatment, or the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (dabrafenib plus trametinib [DAB + TRAM], vemurafenib plus cobimetinib [VEM + COBI], encorafenib plus binimetinib [ENCO + BINI]) if the patient has <italic>BRAF-</italic>mutant disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have reported overall survival (OS) data with 4 or 6.5 years of follow-up for each of these regimens, there were no head-to-head comparisons of I-O therapies and BRAF inhibitors or BRAF + MEK inhibitor combinations reported in the literature at the time of this analysis. RCTs of NIVO, NIVO + IPI, or PEMBRO have included comparisons with IPI monotherapy (CheckMate 067 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], CheckMate 069 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and KEYNOTE-006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]) or dacarbazine (CheckMate 066 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]), whereas RCTs with BRAF + MEK inhibitors (coBRIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], COMBI-d [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], COMBI-v [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and COLUMBUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) only included comparisons with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy and were restricted to patients with <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant melanoma.</p><p id="Par12">I-O therapies have demonstrated a sustained plateau of long-term OS in a subset of patients regardless of <italic>BRAF</italic> status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. BRAF + MEK inhibitor combinations have also shown the potential for a plateau of long-term OS, although not necessarily for similar proportions of patients with <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant disease, as has NIVO + IPI (5-year OS rates, 34% with DAB + TRAM and 60% with NIVO + IPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previous indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) have demonstrated that these differences in long-term OS result in nonproportional hazards (i.e., hazard ratios [HRs] that vary over time) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A recent systematic literature review (SLR) of economic evaluations in advanced melanoma showed that only one study examined all licensed treatments (from a Norwegian perspective), with that study based on an ITC that assumed constant HRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Earlier economic evaluations of NIVO + IPI (from a US perspective) found this regimen to be cost ineffective, but these analyses were based on early progression-free survival (PFS) data only (prior to disclosure of OS data from CheckMate 067) and had a limited list of comparators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Consequently, there is a gap in the literature for a comprehensive economic evaluation of all recommended therapies that is based on robust ITCs accounting for differences in long-term OS by drug class. This analysis evaluated the cost-utility of NIVO + IPI in the first-line treatment of advanced melanoma using extrapolations of 5-year OS data from CheckMate 067 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which were the most current data available at the time of the analysis from a third-party US-payer perspective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Model Overview</title><p id="Par13">This cost-utility analysis was adapted from earlier versions of a model developed in support of health technology assessments for NIVO + IPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The analysis was conducted in a three-state framework (pre-progression, post-progression, and death) via a partitioned survival analysis. In this framework, the occupancy of each health state was calculated based on parametric PFS and OS curves. The cumulative survival probabilities for PFS and OS were used to estimate the number of patients occupying each health state in each cycle using the following equations:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par14">Pre-progression = P(PFS)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15">Post-progression = P(OS) &#x02212;&#x000a0; P(PFS)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16">Death = 1 &#x02212; P(OS)</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par17">The total cost and effectiveness of each treatment was calculated by combining the estimated time spent in the pre-progression and post-progression states with the costs and health utilities assigned to those states.

Health state-specific utility weights were used to adjust for quality of life, and the quality-of-life impacts of AEs were also included. Health outcomes included accrued life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs). This analysis was conducted from the US payer perspective and only included direct medical costs. All costs and outcomes were discounted using an annual 3% discount rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Comparators to NIVO + IPI in the model were comprised of NIVO, PEMBRO, DAB + TRAM, VEM + COBI, ENCO + BINI, and IPI. Incremental analysis is presented summarizing the differences in costs and health benefits between the competing treatments as incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs; cost per QALY) for NIVO + IPI. The model was implemented in Microsoft Excel using Visual Basic for Applications (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). All statistical analyses of trial data were performed using Stata 15 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA) or SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical Data</title><p id="Par19">Clinical data for NIVO + IPI were based on the phase III CheckMate 067 trial (NCT01844505), which compared NIVO + IPI or NIVO monotherapy with IPI monotherapy as first-line treatment of patients with unresectable/metastatic, stage III/IV melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Comparator evidence was sourced from an SLR of RCTs that was completed in January 2020 (updated from a previously published SLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). Treatments were evaluated in patients with previously untreated unresectable stage III/IV melanoma.

In the primary analysis, survival curves for each treatment were based on a network meta-analysis (NMA) of OS and PFS outcomes using individual patient data from CheckMate 067 (60-month database lock) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and published evidence identified in the SLR (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a,&#x000a0;b). The NMA was conducted as a fractional polynomial analysis, allowing determination of time-varying HRs. Based on observed survival trends and because both OS and PFS HRs significantly changed over time during the follow-up of each trial, an NMA that could capture these variations was considered to be statistically and visually more appropriate than a proportional hazards NMA that assumed and produced constant HR estimates for relative treatment effects. The best-fitting models were selected based on deviance information criteria, visual inspection, and model parsimony. IPI monotherapy was the reference treatment for all comparisons. Although relative treatment effects for OS and PFS were evaluated in networks assuming time-varying HRs, the HRs estimated at the end of the trial follow-up were carried onward as constants beyond the observed data.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Survival estimations used in the cost-utility analysis included the following: <bold>a</bold> OS, primary analysis, NMA all-comers; <bold>b</bold> PFS, primary analysis, NMA all-comers; (<bold>c</bold>) OS, secondary analysis, NMA <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant subgroup; <bold>d</bold> PFS, secondary analysis, NMA <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant subgroup; <bold>e</bold> OS, secondary analysis, MAIC; (<bold>f</bold>) PFS, secondary analysis, MAIC. <italic>DAB + TRAM</italic> dabrafenib plus trametinib, <italic>ENCO + BINI</italic> encorafenib plus binimetinib, <italic>IPI</italic> ipilimumab, <italic>NIVO + IPI</italic> nivolumab plus ipilimumab, <italic>MAIC</italic> matching-adjusted indirect comparison, <italic>NMA</italic> network meta-analysis, <italic>OS</italic> overall survival, <italic>PEMBRO</italic> pembrolizumab, <italic>PFS</italic> progression-free survival, <italic>VEM + COBI</italic> vemurafenib plus cobimetinib</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41669_2022_348_Fig1a_HTML" id="MO1"/><graphic xlink:href="41669_2022_348_Fig1b_HTML" id="MO10"/></fig></p><p id="Par21">The primary ITC analysis pooled trials with patients who had either <italic>BRAF-</italic>mutant disease only, <italic>BRAF</italic> wild-type disease only, or both <italic>BRAF-</italic>mutant and <italic>BRAF</italic> wild-type diseases, based on the assumption that there is no effect modification by <italic>BRAF</italic> status for non-<italic>BRAF</italic>-targeted therapies. Two secondary analyses based on different specifications for the ITCs were also conducted to examine the sensitivity of the indirect comparison when restricted to the <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant population only.

A standard parametric survival analysis of OS and PFS data was conducted. Evaluation of log&#x02013;log plots, Schoenfeld residuals, and quantile&#x02013;quantile plots indicated a violation of the proportional hazard and accelerated failure time assumptions for both endpoints; therefore, independent models were fitted for each treatment arm. In this approach, the hazard functions of the interventions in the trial were modeled using standard parametric survival distributions (exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, log-normal, log-logistic, and generalized gamma). The best fitting distributions were selected based on statistical goodness-of-fit tests (Akaike information criteria/Bayesian information criteria) and visual inspection of the curves for clinical plausibility and consistency of the OS and PFS curve combinations (Electronic Supplementary Appendix, Section 5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

The model assumed that treatment duration was dictated by the PFS curve (i.e., treatment until progression), with a stopping rule applied. For NIVO + IPI, NIVO, and PEMBRO, a 2-year stopping rule was applied as a base-case assumption according to the guidelines noted above. For the BRAF + MEK inhibitor combinations, the median PFS reported in the literature was applied as a maximum treatment duration (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). For IPI, which has a fixed maximum treatment duration of four doses, a mean of 3.5 doses (sourced from CheckMate 067) was applied to all patients. Survival extrapolations were not altered for patients who discontinued treatment due to the stopping rule. The resulting mean durations for each treatment in the primary analyses are provided in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.</p><p id="Par29">NIVO + IPI was administered in an induction phase during which patients received both drugs, with a maximum of four IPI doses.

In CheckMate 067, 43% of NIVO + IPI patients discontinued both treatments before completing induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. OS and PFS for the subgroup of patients who discontinued treatment during induction were found to be similar to those of the overall population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To account for this, the model incorporated the percentage of patients who completed induction by response status at 4 months. The model then applied a fixed time on treatment for patients who did not complete induction and a treat-to-progression approach (with a 2-year stopping rule) for those who completed induction, went on to maintenance therapy with NIVO, and remained on treatment until progression.</p><p id="Par30">This approach to modeling treatment duration&#x02014;based on the PFS curves combined with a stopping rule&#x02014;was necessary in this analysis because detailed time-to-discontinuation data or information on mean duration were not available for all competing treatments in the clinical trials. In contrast, the PFS curves afforded a consistent approach because, with the exception of IPI, these treatments are generally administered until progression. To test the impact of this assumption on the results, we also applied a 5-year stopping rule to I-O therapies as a sensitivity analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Utilities</title><p id="Par31">Utility estimates in the model were based on an analysis of EuroQol-5 dimensions-3 levels (EQ-5D-3L) utility scores collected in CheckMate 067 using the US time trade-off tariff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Longitudinal multivariate models were explored to determine significant predictors of utility over time. Progression status, baseline EQ-5D-3L, month prior to death, and assigned treatment were all significant predictors of utility over time.

Net monetary benefit acceptability curves (NBAC) summarized the PSA results for various willingness-to-pay ceiling ratios.

At the time of this analysis, data from CheckMate 067 had reached a minimum of 5 years of follow-up, with median OS not yet reached for NIVO + IPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This combination was found to be cost effective versus I-O monotherapy and BRAF + MEK inhibitor combinations, with all base-case ICURs falling below $100,000 per QALY (less than three times gross domestic product per capita in the US = $195,000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. These results highlight the additional clinical and economic value of adding IPI to NIVO as first-line treatment for advanced melanoma.</p><p id="Par41">In this analysis, OS and PFS were estimated using a time-varying treatment effect based on various ITC methods. Across all ITC analyses, HRs for NIVO + IPI compared with other treatments varied significantly with time, generally showing limited or no survival benefit in the first 3&#x02013;9 months of follow-up, followed by steady decreases to statistically significant HRs over time for most comparisons. With a more traditional constant HR approach, the survival curves would not have adequately captured the existing evidence on the survival experience with both BRAF inhibitors and I-O therapies. Using the time-varying HR estimates, the modeled curves have the expected plateau shape for the I-O therapies, as demonstrated in the 5-year data for IPI from pooled phase II and III studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and for NIVO + IPI from CheckMate 067 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Conversely, the primary analyses in the current report potentially underestimate the performance of the BRAF + MEK inhibitor combinations. In the MAIC secondary analyses, in which the NIVO + IPI data were reweighted to match the average baseline characteristics from the individual BRAF + MEK inhibitor trial populations, there was a more gradual decline in the estimated HR for NIVO + IPI versus the BRAF + MEK inhibitor combinations than noted in the overall population NMA or the <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant subgroup NMA.</p><p id="Par42">Estimations of the reference OS and PFS curves for IPI (and NIVO + IPI in the MAIC analysis) were based on CheckMate 067 data with 5 years of follow-up. The best-fitting parametric distributions were selected based on statistical metrics of goodness-of-fit, visual inspection of the extrapolated curves, and plausibility of the combined expressions of OS and PFS within a given treatment arm. Although several distributions provided similar fits for the observed data, there was considerable variability in the extrapolated tails beyond the study follow-up. This is not uncommon given the different distributional assumptions in the shape of the underlying hazard functions. When secondary distribution selections were tested in sensitivity analysis, while estimates of total QALYs and costs by treatment arm shifted, the incremental costs and QALY gains by NIVO + IPI versus the comparators were not found to be particularly sensitive to the choice of the survival curves extrapolating these data.</p><p id="Par43">A key driver in these results was the cost of subsequent therapy (i.e., second-line systemic therapy). NIVO + IPI had the lowest costs associated with subsequent therapy and was the only treatment in which subsequent treatment costs were substantially lower than the costs associated with initial therapy, which helps offset its higher costs in that category. This analysis did not specifically model treatment sequencing, as has been done in other economic evaluations of patients with metastatic melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] in which patients were assumed to continue only with a single choice of subsequent treatment in each sequence. OS estimates from the trials informing this analysis were likely influenced by the receipt of subsequent therapies after treatment discontinuation, and our analyses attempted to account for the costs associated with that mix of subsequent treatments, rather than modeling and providing a comparison of each individual treatment sequence. For this reason, subsequent treatment costs were based on the distributions reported in the CheckMate 067 and COMBI-d/COMBI-v trials. Trial data documenting the actual duration of individual subsequent therapies would have yielded a more precise account of the estimated subsequent therapy costs. Since such data were not available from CheckMate-067 or from the competitor trials, an assumed identical mean duration of 4.9 months for all treatments (except IPI) was utilized instead. This duration was based on mean second-line PFS data for patients previously treated with PD-1 therapies reported by Zimmer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The median PFS from this study is broadly aligned with similar second-line PFS estimates from the literature based on real-world data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Despite the limitations in our approach to estimating costs related to subsequent treatments, the economic evaluations presented here are generally consistent with the findings from a prior economic evaluation based on a treatment sequencing analysis, which demonstrated that first-line therapy with NIVO + IPI (followed by BRAF + MEK inhibitor therapy) was most cost effective at thresholds greater than $80,000 per QALY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Additional limitations of this study should be noted. There are limited real-world data on the duration of first-line treatment for NIVO + IPI in clinical practice. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) state that the optimal duration of anti&#x02013;PD-1 therapy is currently unknown, but indicate that most patients who respond and discontinue anti&#x02013;PD-1 monotherapy after 2 years maintain the response to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A recent retrospective chart review estimated that mean first-line treatment durations ranged from 45 to 57 weeks for I-O therapies and were 45 weeks for a BRAF + MEK inhibitor regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In our primary analysis, patients were treated until progression with a treatment-specific maximum treatment duration unless they experienced prior progression. The effective mean treatment durations from the base-case stopping rules presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> are slightly lower, but are still broadly aligned with these real-world estimates (40&#x02013;53 weeks [9&#x02013;12 months] for I-O therapies excluding IPI, and 34&#x02013;36 weeks [8&#x02013;9 months] for BRAF + MEK inhibitor combinations). This comparison was verified by the chart review noting particularly that the efficacy observed with all treatments in their study was slightly higher than reported treatment durations in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Without a treatment cap, an estimated proportion of patients could potentially receive lifelong treatment (i.e., full-time horizon of 30 years), which would not be a realistic representation of real-world practice for any treatment, particularly for NIVO + IPI. In CheckMate 067, most patients treated with NIVO + IPI discontinued treatment prior to completing the IPI induction phase, and yet still experienced a durable response. At a median follow-up of 12 months, 30% and 37% of patients in the NIVO + IPI and NIVO arms remained on treatment, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; at 5 years, the percentage of patients who were still on treatment fell to 8% and 18% (among those still alive at 5 years), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Meanwhile, at the 5-year cut-off, 74% of patients in the NIVO + IPI arm and 58% of those in the NIVO arm who were still alive had not received any subsequent therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the median treatment-free interval following NIVO + IPI therapy was reported to more than 18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While this model did not alter survival projections for patients who discontinued treatment due to a stopping rule (because there were no clinical data available to support such an adjustment), data from CheckMate 067 provide supporting evidence that this is not an unreasonable assumption. In a more conservative testing scenario including patients treated with I-O therapy up to 5 years (keeping the maximum duration for BRAF + MEK inhibitors at their base case of approximately 1 year), results maintained NIVO + IPI as a highly cost-effective treatment option.</p><p id="Par46">Lastly, it should be noted that given the limitations of the KEYNOTE-006 trial, the survival projections for PEMBRO were potentially underestimated in the base case because they are ultimately based on a mixed first- and second-line treatment population. As such, comparisons of NIVO + IPI versus PEMBRO should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">Despite the lack of head-to-head evidence comparing NIVO + IPI with BRAF + MEK inhibitor combinations at the time of this analysis, robust ITCs have shown NIVO + IPI to have a sustained survival benefit in both all-comer and <italic>BRAF-</italic>mutant subgroups. This analysis builds on these findings, showing that, in addition to sustained clinical benefit, NIVO + IPI is a cost-effective option in the US for these patients compared with other first-line treatments at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec13"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="41669_2022_348_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 387 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Helen Johnson was an employee at Bristol Myers Squibb at the time of analysis.</p></fn><fn><p>Victoria Federico Paly was an employee at ICON plc at the time of analysis.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Brian Stwalley and Cho-Han Lee for their contributions to data interpretation.

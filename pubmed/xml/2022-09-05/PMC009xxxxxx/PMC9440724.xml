It started with frontline healthcare workers, followed by older adults aged &#x02265;60 years and other high-risk groups. The Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine was the first available vaccine to be given to older adults aged &#x02265;60 years. To receive vaccination, the target population was invited to register via an official COVID-19 vaccine application. However, some older adults were hesitant or refused to get vaccinated and did not register for the vaccine program. Vaccine hesitancy led to lower vaccination rates and was a substantial obstacle to achieving coverage and community immunity in the target population.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Frequently-reported hesitancy factors related to the vaccine delivery program included underlying diseases and other barriers to COVID-19 vaccination among older adults. These barriers can be divided into structural- and attitude-related barriers.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Common structural barriers included cost, time, transportation, and clinic location.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Attitude-related barriers included individuals&#x02019; beliefs or perceptions that may have reduced their willingness to seek out or accept vaccination. Misinformation and misconceptions of vaccination because of lack of knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine literacy could lead to negative attitudes. Negative attitudes about vaccines have a significant link to vaccine hesitancy<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> whereas positive attitudes significantly increase vaccination intention.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref> Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination remain one of the most important factors affecting vaccination intention.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref></p><p>Health literacy is a key factor for enhancing healthy behaviors and choices. Previous studies on COVID-19 vaccination have shown that inadequate health or vaccine literacy was significantly associated with attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> and an unwillingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, vaccine literacy has been shown to be a significant factor that influences vaccination intention<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and reduces vaccine hesitancy.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Recently, a COVID-19 vaccine literacy scale was developed to measure and assess a person&#x02019;s ability to understand, appraise, and apply existing information about the COVID-19 vaccine to make an appropriate decision about vaccination.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This highlighted that vaccine literacy is an essential factor affecting vaccination intention.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref></p><p>Research about vaccine literacy, attitudes, and vaccination intention has not been conducted among older adults in Thailand in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Participants were also asked whether they were vaccinated, were health professionals, and if they had an underlying disease. In addition, participants were asked to respond to two questions: &#x0201c;Have you already received the COVID-19 vaccination?&#x0201d; (1 = Yes, 0 = No), and &#x0201c;Will you get the COVID-19 vaccine?&#x0201d; (1 = Will not get, 2 = Not sure, or 3 = Will get for sure).

There were five positively worded items and five negatively worded items. For example, &#x0201c;I think the COVID-19 vaccine is helpful&#x0201d; (positive) and &#x0201c;The COVID-19 vaccination can have adverse effects&#x0201d; (negative). Negatively worded items were reverse scored. Total scores ranged from 10 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a more positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination.

The stem of the eight items in the second dimension was, &#x0201c;When looking for information about future COVID-19 vaccines or current vaccines: Have you/Did you &#x02026; ? Each of the 12 items had an ordinal 4-point response option (1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, and 4 = Often). Negatively worded items were reversed scored.

Thai female older adults also had a higher mean score for COVID-19 vaccine literacy than males, which was consistent with previous study from Asia that reported similar results.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> However, the study from Italy showed that Italian females&#x02019; mean scores on vaccine literacy were lower than males, although their median scores were identical.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>The COVID-19 vaccination intention among Thai older adults (81.3%) was similar to that reported in a general population survey conducted in Southeast Asia (83.5%)<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> but higher than the responses to a multi-country survey (71.3%).<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Other studies of vaccination intention specific to older adults showed intention rates varied widely from 52.7% to 91.3%.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref> The responses given for vaccination intention among Thai older adults may have been because this study was conducted during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when the incidence of COVID-19 and mortality were increasing, particularly among older adults. As the perception of the severity of COVID-19 infection worsened, vaccination intention increased. This was congruent with what has been reported elsewhere.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The reasons for vaccination hesitancy given by Thai older adults (potential side effects and vaccine safety) were also the most common reasons for the unwillingness to get vaccinated reported in other studies.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35&#x02013;37</xref> In addition, lack of trust in COVID-19 vaccines and concern about side effects were voiced by respondents in another study.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>The scores for attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccine among Thai older adults who perceived they had an adequate income were higher than those with a perceived inadequate income.

Our results that Thai older adults who either received the COVID-19 vaccination or were accepting of the vaccination had more positive attitudes than their non-vaccinated or non-accepting counterparts were consistent with other studies.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>We found significant relationships between COVID-19 vaccine literacy, attitudes toward vaccines, and COVID-19 vaccination intention.

The online data collection might have produced some bias. The method of recruitment might also have facilitated responses from participants who may have been similar to the researchers. Not only were the participants better educated than the general Thai population, but the number of health professionals was disproportionately high. However, the self-selection of participants and the cross-sectional design do not negate the results but provide context to this study. Results may change with a larger sample and as the pandemic enters into different phases.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion and Recommendations</title><p>Older adults in this study reported high level of vaccination and vaccination intention. COVID-19 vaccine literacy and attitudes are significant factors related to vaccination intention. Side effects of vaccines and vaccine safety remain major concerns among older adults in Thailand, especially among the group with vaccine hesitancy. The older adult population should be targeted for improving COVID-19 vaccine literacy, particularly those aged &#x02265;70 years and who are less educated. These findings provide essential insights for policy makers to design effective communications with vulnerable groups about vaccine safety so that they understand that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the possible risks. Health professionals could play an important role in enhancing vaccine literacy among older adults. Positive attitudes and COVID-19 vaccine literacy can enhance vaccination uptake in older adults.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The researchers would like to thank the older adults who participated in this study.

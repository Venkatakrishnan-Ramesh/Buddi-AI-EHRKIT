A recent study examining the microbiomes obtained via both skin biopsies and swabs revealed a significant difference in normal skin. We hypothesized that the microbiome profile of patients with psoriasis from tape stripping and skin biopsy might be different. This study sought to contribute to microbiome research on psoriasis by investigating the changes in the microbiome during narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) therapy by comparing the results from the different sampling techniques of tape stripping and skin biopsy.</p></sec><sec id="s2002"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Twenty-three participants, including 14 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and nine healthy controls, were recruited, and nine patients with psoriasis completed 20-sessions of NBUVB treatment. Skin microbiota from both techniques was analyzed using the 16S rRNA gene at baseline and after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2003"><title>Results</title><p>A clear difference was observed between the results from the two sampling techniques. Alpha diversity of the microbiota obtained from tape stripping was higher than that of the microbiota from skin biopsy, whereas beta diversity was clustered into two groups by sampling technique. The microbiome was altered during NBUVB treatment using both sampling techniques.</p></sec><sec id="s2004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Different sampling techniques resulted in different microbiome profiles in patients with psoriasis. Tape stripping and swabs are feasible procedures and are mostly used in psoriasis and other skin microbiome studies; however, skin biopsy may also expand our understanding of psoriasis and other skin diseases that pathophysiology involves deeper to the dermis or subcutaneous tissue.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>skin microbiome</kwd><kwd>psoriasis</kwd><kwd>sampling techniques</kwd><kwd>NBUVB</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

They also boost the immune system and play a similar role as microorganisms in the human gut by helping to decompose natural matter.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Many common skin diseases are caused by changes in skin microbiota.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is evidence to suggest that the onset of both human and animal psoriasis might be associated with changes in the skin or gut microbiota influencing host homeostasis and immune response, particularly in Th17 cell development.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;9</xref> It is still unclear whether changes in the microbial community and its context are correlated with clinical appearance and treatment response.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> One standard form of psoriasis treatment is narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) irradiation, which can influence the innate immune system, as well as the adaptive cellular immune response.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Assarsson et al<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> reported that NBUVB treatment affects the skin microbiota in swab samples of patients with psoriasis and suggested that these findings are associated with treatment response.</p><p>Although it is theorized that psoriasis pathogenesis involves the dermis, Grice et al, compared the microbiome obtained by swabs, scrapes and biopsies. They reported a comparable microbial composition from all the employed sampling techniques.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> From then, a high proportion of studies have utilized samples obtained by swabbing the skin surface. However, a recent study by Prast-Nielsen examining the microbiomes obtained via both skin biopsies and swabs revealed stark differences in the context of normal skin.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> When sampling approaches vary, the composition of the microbiota may also differ, as studies involving mucosal or gut luminal samples have confirmed.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A study by Fahlen et al,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> however, presented variation in study outcomes when the skin from psoriasis patients was sampled using biopsies compared with the observed microbiome from other studies using swabs. Therefore, it is essential that the sampling technique employed allows a genuinely representative sample to be obtained.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> To further illuminate the consequences of different sampling approaches, this study sought to contribute to microbiome research by investigating the changes in the microbiome during NBUVB therapy and compare the results from tape stripping and skin biopsies, two different sampling techniques. This study may provide valuable insights regarding microbiome study.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Study Participants</title><p>This study focused on 23 Thai citizens aged 18 years or older. Of these patients, 14 presented with chronic plaque psoriasis, whereas nine served as healthy controls. All recruitment was conducted as a cross-sectional study at baseline.</p><p>Patients who were excluded were those with cancer, psoriatic arthritis, or autoimmune disease, along with those in immunocompromised states, and those using oral antibiotics, immunomodulators, systemic anti-inflammatory agents, probiotics, or those who had been dieting to a significant extent during the month before the commencement of the study. Patients who were undergoing additional treatment for psoriasis, those who had undergone topical therapy during the previous two weeks, and those who had undergone systemic therapy within the previous month were also excluded. Participants with contraindications to NBUVB were also excluded, thus eliminating those with xeroderma pigmentosum or hereditary conditions associated with UV-induced carcinogenesis, skin cancer, or photodermatosis. Photosensitive participants were also excluded, along with pregnant or lactating women. The healthy control group was required to be free of psoriasis and dermatosis, and to have no first-degree relatives diagnosed with psoriasis.</p><p>The protocols employed for the study were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Thammasat University (COA: 188/2563), and the research was performed at the OPD Dermatology, Benjakitti Park Hospital, from August to December 2020.</p><p>All the participants provided written informed consent. The history of each participant was recorded, including age, sex, BMI, skin type, occupation, smoking and drinking habits, diet, sleep patterns, exposure to sunlight, underlying health conditions, current medications, family health history, and personal background. A physical check was also performed, and psoriasis severity was assessed using the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI).</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2002"><title>Sample Collection</title><p>For two weeks prior to the study, the participants were permitted to use only very mild liquid soaps and moisturizing creams, and washing was prohibited during the final 24 h before the samples were taken. Bacterial colonization of the skin relies on skin physiology;<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> therefore, the samples were all drawn from skin regions considered dry microenvironments. Skin without lesions was determined to be normal and was located no less than 5 cm from the psoriatic lesions. Because psoriasis has a symmetrical appearance, it was not possible to find a non-lesional match using the matching skin site on the contralateral side of the body.</p><p>Skin microbiota samples of all participants were collected using tape stripping. In patients with psoriasis, an area of 3&#x000d7;3 cm of a target lesion, which was fully developed and not located on the sun-exposed area, and a nearby normal skin area were selected. Tape-stripped samples were drawn from the healthy control group at baseline from the matching sites. To obtain sufficient DNA, the use of 2 cm-diameter adhesive tape discs sterilized via ultraviolet radiation, sticking, and peeling was performed in 50 cycles.</p><p>In the psoriasis group, a 3 mm punch biopsy was performed at both the target lesion site and non-lesional skin from areas adjacent, but not overlapping, to the tape stripping sites. Before biopsy sampling was performed, 2% Xylocaine local anesthetic was used, but no antiseptics were applied prior to sample collection. Once obtained, all samples from both techniques were frozen at a temperature of &#x02212;80&#x02103;.</p><p>NBUVB was then performed in line with the clinical protocol, and further samples were obtained via both biopsy and tape stripping following either 20 NBUVB sessions or an improvement of 75%. New samples were taken from the same sites, although the new biopsy process did not overlap with the existing wound from the previous biopsy.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2003"><title>NBUVB Protocol</title><p>A Waldmann 5002 cabin (Waldmann Medizintechnik, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany) was used to provide the NBUVB (311 nm) therapy.

However, psoriasis pathogenesis begins within the dermis, commencing with the appearance of CD4-activated lymphocytes, which then make their way to the epidermis.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Therefore, a sampling approach that focuses solely on the surface of the skin may prove inadequate for evaluating the skin microbiota. Recently, Prast-Nielsen emphasized the difference between microbiota profiles from different sampling techniques: swabs and biopsies from normal skin. However, our study is the first to draw comparisons between microbiome changes during the course of NBUVB therapy via tape stripping which represents surface microbiota and skin biopsy which represents microbiota of the full skin layer.</p><p>In line with Prast-Nielsen, our data revealed that skin biopsy and tape stripping showed significant differences in alpha diversity, higher Chao1 and Shannon diversities from tape stripping than from skin biopsy samples, beta diversity that showed a clustering into two groups by sampling techniques, and microbial communities that reported a different kind of microbiota captured from tape stripping and biopsy. A potential explanation for the reported differences in the bacterial biota when using tape stripping in comparison to biopsies include bacteria being internalized within cells; this is thought to be feasible given that this takes place in the tonsils with &#x003b2;-hemolytic streptococci.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Therefore, it may be the case that psoriasis patients harbor additional bacteria in their dermal and epidermal cells. Nakatsuji et al<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> noted that a different microbiota may be present in the dermis, epidermis, and superficial adipose tissue. The pilosebaceous unit hosts many bacteria, which will only appear on the skin surface under the application of pressure<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> it would not be possible for tape stripping or swabs to detect such bacteria. The bacteria living in the squames of the stratum corneum might not be the same as those on the skin surface. Indeed, parts of the skin below the surface have been shown to host bacteria that differ from those on the surface,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and therefore it is unlikely that bacteria discovered through the use of tape stripping or swabs alone would represent anything more than a small fraction of the entire skin microbiota.</p><p>Changes in microbial abundance during NBUVB treatment were detected from both sampling techniques. This may suggest that not only the surface microbiota but also the microbiota in the deeper layer was altered after NBUVB treatment. These changes could be related to the treatment and may affect the clinical response. Future studies with a larger number of participants and including skin biopsies from patients with psoriasis are needed to provide robust data for analysis.</p><p>Previous studies using the swab technique reported inconsistent results for microbial diversity,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;30</xref> whereas no significant difference was detected with the biopsy technique.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The inconsistency in these findings might be attributable to differences in the methods applied, such as the sampling approaches used, the possibility of heightened variation between individuals, or encountering certain niches within the various sampling locations. In this study, we sought to minimize the variability that can result from differences in intra- and inter-individual microbiota profiles. For example, we used both psoriatic and normal skin samples taken from ecologically dry regions of the same individuals, as well as tape-stripped skin samples from healthy control patients. However, our small sample size may not be sufficient to reveal the diversity of differences. Alternatively, psoriasis may not have specific patterns of taxonomical richness, evenness, or community variability but could be more closely connected with the relative abundance of microbiota and the existence of specific microbes.</p><p>Using the tape stripping technique, our findings revealed a difference in bacterial abundance between psoriasis and control and between lesional and non-lesional skin. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria were prominent in healthy controls, whereas patients with psoriasis exhibited dominant Actinobacteria. As topographic characteristics of the human body affect the skin microbiota, there are three main ecological areas: sebaceous, moist, and dry. We collected all samples from dry areas that were shown to be inhabited by a mixture of species, although Proteobacteria was dominant. We found Actinobacteria to be dominant in psoriatic skin, in line with Alekseyenko et al<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> who proposed that the microbiota of psoriatic lesions display enrichment with cutaneotype 2. This may correspond to the disease&#x02019;s influence being greater extent than that of the topographical effect. At the genus level, <italic toggle="yes">Corynebacterium</italic> was found to be the most abundant in patients with psoriasis and healthy controls, whereas <italic toggle="yes">Propionibacterium</italic> was dominant in the healthy controls. Earlier research found that <italic toggle="yes">Corynebacterium</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Propionibacterium</italic> are imbalanced in psoriatic patients with lesional skin; the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Corynebacterium</italic> was higher, whereas that of <italic toggle="yes">Propionibacterium</italic> was lower. Two further studies reported lower abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Propionibacterium</italic> in the skin with lesions.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The abundance of <italic toggle="yes">Propionibacterium</italic> is much greater in healthy skin than in hidradenitis suppurativa skin,<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> suggesting that <italic toggle="yes">Propionibacterium</italic> and its strain populations might provide protective benefits. Moreover, psoriatic lesions are typically dry, which would not be an ideal setting for <italic toggle="yes">Propionibacterium</italic> as this type favors greater humidity in sebaceous skin, whereas <italic toggle="yes">Corynebacterium</italic> does not fare well in acidic settings and is less frequently observed in sebaceous skin.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>We found that <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> was significantly more abundant on lesional skin, in accordance with the results of Tett et al<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> using shotgun metagenomics, whereas Assarsson et al<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> found significantly lower levels of <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> prior to treatment in lesional skin than in non-lesional skin, which is in contrast to a previous study. <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> is a diverse genus. Some species, such as the commensal <italic toggle="yes">S. epidermidis</italic>, appear to enhance the innate immune barrier and limit pathogen invasion,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> whereas others, such as <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, evoke a pathogenic Th17 response.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, the abundance of <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> increased, whereas that of <italic toggle="yes">S. epidermis</italic> decreased when examined in patients with psoriatic lesions.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>Following NBUVB treatment, significantly reduced <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> abundance was observed in both lesional and non-lesional skin suggesting that NBUVB affects the growth of this bacteria and possibly affects treatment response. These findings were consistent with previous studies showing that UVR inhibits <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> growth in vivo and in vitro<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39&#x02013;41</xref> and lowers the generation of super-antigens, which are understood to have the capacity to induce immune responses.<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>The skin biopsy findings showed that the most abundant phylum in cases of psoriasis was Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes and Actinobacterium, which differs from Fahlen et al,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> who reported that the most common phylum in controls and psoriasis lesions was Firmicutes, followed by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. This could result from the different locations of skin sampling. After NBUVB, the genus Acinetobacter and the order Caulobacterales were more enriched in lesions, whereas the family Bradyrhizobiaceae was dominant in non-lesional skin.</p><p>Changes in skin microbiota after NBUVB from tape stripping and biopsy may be explained by NBUVB directly affecting epidermal and dermal microbiota by DNA and membrane damage, or indirectly through changes of surface microbiota which subsequently shape the dermal microbiota, or by a local/systemic immunological effect of NBUVB. Although it is clear that a microbiota comprising diverse residents exists, the details of its functioning in the skin remain to be determined, along with the question of which inhabitants play helpful, harmful, or neutral roles. Additionally, if and how changes in skin microbiota correlate with psoriasis and treatment response are still unknown.</p><p>This study had certain limitations, such as its small sample size. Thus, a study with more participants is needed to confirm our findings. The skin biopsy group did not include healthy controls owing to ethical issues. Although we tried to control for inter- and intra-personal variation, other factors, such as known or unknown underlying diseases and medications, may also affect the skin microbiota.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study revealed that different sampling techniques (tape stripping and skin biopsy) result in different microbiome profiles in patients with psoriasis. In addition, the microbiome was altered during NBUVB treatment using both sampling techniques.

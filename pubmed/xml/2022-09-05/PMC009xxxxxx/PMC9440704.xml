Decades of continuous war in Afghanistan has left the medical infrastructure of the country in a miserable situation. There is a serious deficiency in research work in the fields of pathology and oncology at the moment with minimal data available to elaborate about the demographic characteristics of various malignant disorders in the country, which would be indispensable to pave the way for further research and development.</p></sec><sec id="s2002"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to describe the prevalence, distribution, and important histopathological features of malignant tumors reported at tertiary level in Afghanistan.</p></sec><sec id="s2003"><title>Results</title><p>Out of 2328 consecutive cases of solid malignant tumors included in our study, 93.8% were primary and 6.2% were metastatic. Breast was the most common site of origin for primary malignancy (29.5%) in females; however, in males, esophagus was the leading site for primary malignant tumors (16.3%). Invasive ductal carcinoma was the most common histologic type of malignancy in females (87.9%). However, in both genders, squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus and skin, osteosarcoma of bone and soft tissue, and glioblastoma of central nervous system were the most common histologic types of malignancies diagnosed. Small intestine was a frequently involved site affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Overall, the majority of the cancers were diagnosed in stage-II.</p></sec><sec id="s2004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Findings in our study were somewhat similar to data presented elsewhere in the world, with some significant differences that could be related to the local factors. Our study revealed that most of the malignant tumors were diagnosed in later stages of the disease, attributable to scarcity of specialized oncology institutions and public awareness.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>prevalence</kwd><kwd>lymphoma</kwd><kwd>sarcoma</kwd><kwd>Afghanistan</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="7"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity around the globe.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Among non-communicable diseases (NCDs), malignant tumors constitute the second leading cause of death worldwide, following cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> According to the global mortality data (2019), for every ten persons dying of NCDs, three premature deaths occur due to cancer.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It was responsible for 9.43 million deaths in year 2016, followed by an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018, globally.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Recently, this number has risen to 10.0 million deaths according to an estimation in the year 2020, of which, 5.5 million deaths occurred in male and 4.4 million deaths in female population with an incidence of 19.3 million new cases worldwide.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>According to the Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) cancer statistics for the year 2020, the leading ten most common cancers in male population globally were lung malignancies (14.3%), prostate cancers (14.1%), non-melanoma skin cancers (7.2%), stomach cancer (7.1%), liver cancer (6.3%), colon cancer (6.0%), bladder cancer (4.4%), cancer of the rectum (4.4%), esophageal cancer (4.2) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.0%), while in females, it included malignancies of the breast (24.5%), lung (8.4%), uterine cervix (6.5%), colon (5.9%), non-melanoma cancers of skin (5.2%), thyroid (4.9%), uterine corpus (4.5%), stomach (4.0%), ovary (3.4%), and rectum (3.1%).<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), most of the people with cancer live in low and middle income countries, and the overall cancer survival rates in the developed countries are higher than in the developing countries, such as Afghanistan.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In 1968, Leslie H.

These findings closely resemble the results obtained by Oluogun et al, in a study in Nigeria, which also revealed that IDC was the leading histologic type of breast cancer (88.9%), followed by ILC, medullary carcinoma and mucinous carcinoma.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Our study&#x02019;s findings were also in agreement with Ahmad et al, who found that IDC was the most commonly diagnosed histologic type of breast cancer with a slight difference in types of cancers.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> They revealed that IDC was followed by ILC and metaplastic carcinoma in order of frequency; however in our study, IDC was followed by metaplastic carcinoma in the 2nd position and ILC was in 3rd.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>In consideration of tumor grading, histologic grades of IDC and ILC were included in our study, showing that grade-II tumors were on the peak, followed by grade-III and grade-I tumors in order of frequency. These results were comparable to the findings in a study by Metzger-Filho et al, which revealed that grade-II tumors, comprising 61.3%, were the most common, followed by grade-I and grade-III.

According to the findings in our study, it was the second most common site for primary malignant tumors in males following esophagus and third most common site in female population following breast and esophagus. Cutaneous malignancies are usually classified into malignant melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) categories, the latter includes the leading histologic types of skin cancers comprising SCC and BCC as major subtypes.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In NMSC, BCC is known to be the commonest subtype that constitutes 80% of the NMSC diagnosed in the United States of America (USA) annually.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> SCC is the second most frequently occurring subtype of NMSC and despite its low frequency compared to BCC, the mortality rate of SCC is higher than that of BCC in the USA.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Malignant melanoma is another common skin cancer which comprises 4.6% of newly diagnosed cancer in the USA that is in fifth position in males and sixth in females considering the frequency of diagnosis.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> According to our study&#x02019;s results, SCC was the most common cutaneous malignancy followed by BCC and malignant melanoma, that was different from the epidemiologic findings in the USA and other western countries, where BCC is the major histologic type of skin malignancies, probably due to the skin pigmentation of individuals, inherent genetic variabilities and sociocultural differences, as BBC commonly arises in light and fair skin that is vulnerable to ultraviolet exposure.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In contest of Asia, a study done by Laishram et al, in Manipur State of India, revealed identical findings to our study, as they showed that out of 92 histologically diagnosed skin malignancies, SCC was the most commonly diagnosed cancer type, comprising 43.6%, followed by BCC 32.6%, and malignant melanoma 14.2%.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Down to the fourth position, malignant bone and soft tissue tumors comprised another important category of tumors in our study, accounting for 169 (7.7%) of 2183 primary malignant tumors that we diagnosed, in which, 72 (6.6%) cases were related to females and 97 (8.9%) cases to males. Osteosarcoma was the most common diagnosis among malignant bone and soft tissue tumors in our study, followed by rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing&#x02019;s sarcoma, synovial sarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Our findings were somewhat similar when compared to the findings of a study conducted by Ozt&#x000fc;rk et al, in Turkey; they also demonstrated that osteosarcoma was the leading bone malignancy followed by Ewing&#x02019;s sarcoma and chondrosarcoma, however in soft tissue malignancies, they showed that liposarcoma was the commonest followed by synovial sarcoma and malignant mesenchymal tumors, which was different from our findings, as mentioned previously.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The primary malignant tumors of central nervous system were relatively uncommon comprising only 2% of all cancers; however, despite the application of proper treatment protocols, it causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Studies revealed that the overall incidence of primary malignant central nervous system tumors has increased recently with the incidence rate of 3.4 per 100,000 population globally.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In agreement with that, primary malignant CNS tumors were less common compared to other cancers in our study, and were in 19th position in order of frequency. Only 34 cases of high grade primary malignant CNS tumors were included in which it was demonstrated that glioblastoma (WHO grade-IV) was the leading histologic type of malignant CNS tumor, followed by anaplastic ependymoma (WHO grade-III) and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (WHO grade-III).</p><p>A study in Pakistan by Ahmad et al, revealed glioblastoma to be the most frequently diagnosed histologic type of CNS malignancy, followed by anaplastic oligodendroglioma and medulloblastoma.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> These results were similar to the findings in our study with regards to glioblastoma being the commonest histologic type of malignant CNS tumor.

These findings were very much different compared to a study conducted by Padhi et al, in India, which revealed that CNS was the most frequently involved site for primary extranodal NHL, constituting 20 (29.5%) cases out of 68, followed by gastrointestinal tract 17 (25%) and nasopharynx 8 (11.8%).<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0004-s2005"><title>Tumor Staging</title><p>The latest 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) manual guidelines were used for reporting the clinical stage of the tumor, using the Tumor, Nodes and Metastasis (TNM) staging system.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> A total of 357 cases of malignant tumors arising from gastrointestinal tract and its appendages, genital tract including female breast, urinary tract and eye were included. The most frequently present tumors at diagnosis were stage-II tumors, comprising 36.7%, followed by stage-III, stage-I and stage-IV; however, no tumor with T-is stage was present in our database. We hypothesize that the rarity of stage-IV tumors was due the high mortality rate of the stage, financial problems of the patients and lack of oncosurgical facilities in the country. Moreover, the small number of stage-I tumors is probably due to the late visit of patients to the doctors and healthcare professionals for check-ups, low socioeconomical status, low level of basic education among Afghan people and the lack of self-awareness and basic information about the disease in the countryside.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-s2006"><title>Tumor Laterality</title><p>The tumor laterality in our study was considered in five paired organs and their specific malignant tumors including: IDC of female breast, RCC of kidney, seminoma of testis, serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary, and retinoblastoma of the eye.

The endoscopic biopsy technique, which is a form of specialized incisional biopsy technique, was in the third position in order of frequency, following open incisional biopsy in second place. Core needle biopsy technique was the fifth most commonly applied technique, which is another specialized type of incisional biopsy technique that requires the expertise of interventional radiologists for sampling soft tissue tumors and tumors involving the internal organs using radiological guidance.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Punch biopsy technique was concluded to be in sixth position in order of frequency in our study, and is considered to be the most commonly used technique for sampling superficial lesions.

Thus, it provides a good picture of the issue and clears the path for implementing future comprehensive and specialized studies regarding malignant disorders in the country.</p><p>On the other hand, although this study was conducted in one of the leading diagnostic and therapeutic private tertiary care centers in the country, the generalization of its findings over the whole population of Afghanistan is questionable as it was carried out in a single institution. In addition to that, a small number of undifferentiated and poorly differentiated tumors were excluded from the study due to the limited number of IHC stains and the lack of molecular testing for confirmative diagnosis, which might have affected the internal validity of the research.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Findings of our study regarding the epidemiological characteristics and histopathological features of various solid malignant tumors were more or less similar to the characteristics that have already been elaborated by various researchers and organizations, pertaining to the prevalence, distribution, types and histopathological features of solid organ malignancies diagnosed in other parts of the world. Minor differences that were noted could be explained to be related to the local, socio-economic, dietary and environmental factors, in particular considering the fact that in Afghanistan the majority of the population lives under the umbrella of poverty with minimal supply of vital nutrients in their daily diet.</p><p>In our study, breast cancer being reported as the commonest malignancy in female gender was in agreement with the reported data in the majority of international literature; however, a significant variability was seen between our study findings and the data reported from other countries about the most common site and type of cancer in males. In the current study, the most common malignancy in males was esophageal cancer, which should be further investigated in terms of etiopathogenesis and the possible linked demographic characteristics of the Afghan population to the disorder.</p><p>Another important finding in our study was the fact that due to lack of availability of specialized healthcare facilities for the majority of the people, most of the malignant tumors were diagnosed in later stages of the disease. Conducting studies to further elaborate about the etiopathogenesis of various malignant tumors and significant changes in healthcare policies to ensure availability of specialized diagnostic and therapeutic facilities for most of the people, would be the key to change the current scenario.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the role played by Agha Khan Development Network (AKDN), for establishing the country&#x02019;s first state of the art Pathology department.</p></ack><sec id="s0007"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>The raw data used to support the findings of this study have not been made publicly accessible because of patient&#x02019; confidentiality and privacy rules; however, it can be shared by the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0008"><title>Disclosure</title><p>All the authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Sung</surname>

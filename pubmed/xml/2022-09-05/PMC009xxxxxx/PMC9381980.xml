The method mitigates some of the known biases in existing approaches for this type of data and provides more robust estimates of symptom incidence over time. In this article we also demonstrate an application of the methodology to Flutracking data for the 12 months from 27th April 2020 until 25th April 2021 in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p id="p0002">As part of this work, we define a range of <italic>Symptom Groupings</italic> that can be used to estimate the incidence of symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and demonstrate the impact of the chosen Symptom Groupings on resulting estimates. Because multiple illnesses can lead to overlapping sets of symptoms, it is important to note that this method does not attempt to diagnose new onset of a specific disease (e.g. COVID-19); rather it estimates the onset of new (sets of) symptoms that are consistent with certain diseases, including COVID-19.</p><p id="p0003">The method and associated code presented here, and available at <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, have been developed to analyse data from the Flutracking survey <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> in Aotearoa New Zealand, but can be easily adapted to similar longitudinal data, where self-selection biases and reporting biases are known issues.</p><sec id="sec0003"><title>Background</title><p id="p0004">Flutracking <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> is a participatory health surveillance system for Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand that seeks to estimate the proportion of the population with new onset of symptoms consistent with influenza <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and more recently symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The survey was developed by Hunter Population Health in collaboration with The University of Newcastle. The survey is administered online to volunteer participants from the public. Registered participants receive a weekly email asking them to report any cold, flu, or COVID-like symptoms experienced in the previous week. The survey also allows for participants to report on behalf of family members in their household, such as young children.</p><p id="p0005">Participatory health surveillance systems like Flutracking are a valuable resource for tracking outbreaks of infectious disease. They allow for analysis and reporting on how new onset of symptoms differ over time and between seasons, as well as across different geographic regions. However, there are several typical limitations that can reduce the utility of the results that they provide.</p><p id="p0006">Previous studies have shown that participatory health surveillance systems can be biased in terms of survey participants and response rates over time. Firstly, some participants may be more likely to respond to a survey if they have experienced symptoms in a given week <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> (a form of <italic>reporting bias</italic>), and secondly, participatory samples rely on volunteers and are not representative of the general population <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> (a form of <italic>self-selection bias</italic>). In particular, people from lower socio-economic groups and minority ethnicities are found to be under-represented <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Within Aotearoa New Zealand, we find that Flutracking respondents are disproportionately of P&#x00101;keha/NZ European ethnicity and older, with M&#x00101;ori and Pacific Islanders, and people under 30 years old, being particularly under-represented (see Section&#x000a0;4.1). Both of these biases should be accounted for where possible to improve the reliability of incidence estimates <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0007">Participatory health surveillance studies have commonly focused on influenza tracking and have relied on strict symptom definitions that only describe one experience of influenza-like illness (ILI). For example, previous studies, including current weekly Flutracking reports <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, focus solely on experiences of ILI defined as new onset of both cough and fever in the same week <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. While these symptoms are commonly viewed as core components of ILI <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, this criteria may be insufficient for investigating the rates of a wider range of respiratory illnesses, and in particular, would miss the majority of COVID-19 cases <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p id="p0008">In the context of Aotearoa New Zealand, during the year of data considered in this article (27th April 2020 to 25th April 2021), the COVID-19 Elimination Strategy advised anyone who experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 to seek a test, so as to promptly detect and stamp-out any new community outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Monitoring the performance of such an approach requires estimating the incidence of symptoms that are consistent with COVID-19, including those that do not meet the strict &#x02018;cough and fever&#x02019; ILI definition, in order to determine whether testing rates in a given week are commensurate with incidence of new COVID-like symptoms in the same week.</p><p id="p0009">In this article, we describe a methodology that seeks to address some of the limitations described above for data from the Flutracking survey from Aotearoa New Zealand. Despite this specific application, the method can be applied equally to Flutracking data from Australia, or to similar longitudinal data collected elsewhere (e.g., the &#x0201c;Flu Near You&#x0201d; survey in the United States <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, or &#x0201c;Influenzanet&#x0201d; in Europe <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>). Our approach for determining a subset of responses that are classified as &#x02018;consistent&#x02019; in any given week, in order to reduce reporting bias and to maximise response numbers retained, is also applicable to other datasets with similar issues. For example, it could be easily applied to prevalence estimates calculated from &#x02018;test-to-stay&#x02019; type surveillance data COVID-19 from Rapid Antigen Test results by filtering to only consider results from individuals who were regularly reporting (negatives) in the weeks leading up to a positive test.</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><title>Flutracking data</title><p id="p0010">Raw data are obtained from Flutracking New Zealand <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> through the New Zealand Ministry of Health. Flutracking symptom data consists of a presence/absence indication for each respondent for each of six<xref rid="fn0001" ref-type="fn">1</xref> symptoms: cough, fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, runny nose, and loss of taste or smell. All of these symptoms are part of the New Zealand Ministry of Health&#x02019;s definition of &#x02018;COVID-like symptoms&#x02019; <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p id="p0011">When respondents initially enrol in the Flutracking survey, they are asked to give demographic information, including age, ethnicity, location (postcode), and gender. Participants are also asked about their vaccination status for COVID-19 and the annual influenza vaccine, and whether they have been tested for COVID-19 in the previous week. An example of the weekly survey is shown in <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>. If a respondent indicates that they are experiencing symptoms, they are then asked whether they sought healthcare or missed work/usual activities due to the illness, and whether they were tested for COVID-19 or Influenza.<fig id="fig0001"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Example of the Flutracking weekly survey, sent to participants via email.

Specifically, we wish to identify any <italic>new</italic> onset of symptoms that meet the threshold for an &#x02018;incident&#x02019; according to a chosen Symptom Grouping. The method we use follows the same method employed by the Aotearoa New Zealand Ministry of Health and Flutracking Australia for estimating the incidence of ILI (cough and fever), but extends to the Symptom Groupings CLI1+ and CLI2+ above, in addition to the Symptom Grouping for ILI.</p><p id="p0023">Flutracking data contains each respondent&#x02019;s reported symptoms for a given survey week. For a selected Symptom Grouping, we first check whether an individual&#x02019;s symptoms in the given week meet the criteria for that Symptom Grouping. If so, we mark it as an Incident. For example, if we wanted to investigate the number of CLI1+ Incidents, we would record all weeks where an individual recorded one or more of the six COVID-like symptoms as an Incident.</p><p id="p0024"><xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> provides a hypothetical example of a respondent who reported different symptoms over the course of 8 weeks.<fig id="fig0002"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Example of symptoms reported each week for one hypothetical respondent. This illustration shows a period of 8 survey weeks, with reported symptoms (or non-response) indicated for each week. The symptoms reported include <bold>A</bold> Asymptomatic (i.e. a response indicating no symptoms), <bold>C</bold> Cough, <bold>F</bold> Fever, <bold>N</bold> runny Nose, and <bold>T</bold> sore Throat. A dot indicates the respondent did not answer the survey that week. In this hypothetical case, we see how the responses given can fall under each Symptom Grouping and that these <italic>Incidents</italic> cover different survey weeks depending on the patterns of symptoms. As CLI1+ is the most inclusive Symptom Grouping, the criteria for this are met in most weeks shown here and it is considered a single <italic>Incident</italic>, while the Symptom Groupings ILI and CLI2+ would be split into two separate <italic>Incidents</italic> during the same time period. We can also see that CLI1+ and CL2+ (but not ILI) span a period including one week where no response was given. This is because we assume that the missing week would be a continuation of the same <italic>Incident</italic>, provided it meets the same Symptom Grouping criteria. The * indicates which week will be included as the onset of the <italic>Incident</italic>, and will be included in the &#x02018;Incidence&#x02019; calculations.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0002">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0025">To distinguish new onset of illness from the continuation of a previously reported Incident, each Incident is assigned a unique ID, with this same Incident ID given to all consecutive weeks that meet the Symptom Grouping. If there is no response for one week between two weeks in which the Symptom Grouping was met, it is assumed that the interstitial week is a continuation of the previous week&#x02019;s Incident and it is allocated the same Incident ID. For any gaps in responses between Incidents longer than one week we allocate the second Incident a new Incident ID. This procedure is consistent with the existing methodology used by Flutracking Australia and Flutracking New Zealand.</p><p id="p0026">The incidence calculation is applied independently for each Symptom Grouping. This means that if a respondent reported one symptom in their first week of illness and two or more symptoms in the second week, the second week would be recorded as an &#x02018;Incident&#x02019; of CLI2+, as though it were the onset of a new illness. This means that if a participant met the criteria for CLI1+ for three consecutive weeks, but met the criteria for CLI2+ only in the first and last weeks, this would be recorded as two Incidents of CLI2+, as shown in <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>. This is capturing useful information, as the advice is that someone with new or worsening symptoms should seek a COVID-19 test.</p><p id="p0027">While our approach allows for flexible Symptom Grouping criteria to be implemented within the methodology, future work may seek to apply more sophisticated, unsupervised learning approaches when defining Incidents. While not in the scope of the current research, previous work has demonstrated that unsupervised learning approaches provide a useful technique for modelling heterogeneous symptom experiences among respondents <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0008"><title>Determining the set of consistent responses</title><p id="p0028">Flutracking participants are more likely to respond to the survey when they are experiencing symptoms than when they are well <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. This <italic>symptom reporting bias</italic> can lead to overestimating symptom incidence rates if it is not accounted for. Consequently, it is important to define a subset of <italic>consistent responses</italic> to use for incidence rate calculations. These are defined as being the responses, in a given week, from participants who are deemed to have responded consistently to the survey, as assessed at that week.</p><p id="p0029">Previous studies have determined consistent respondents by only considering responses from those participants who have completed more than some minimum fraction of all surveys (e.g.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). We improve on this approach by determining a subset of consistent responses for each week of the analysis, based on the response history of each survey participant for a defined window prior to the week under consideration. This allows a respondent&#x02019;s &#x02018;consistent&#x02019; status to change from week to week. We implement this by looking back over a specified number of weeks (the &#x02018;window size&#x02019;) and requiring the participant to have responded in all those weeks, with an allowance for a certain number of &#x02018;missing weeks&#x02019; within the window. This makes it possible to adjust for the known reporting bias at any given point in time, while still maximising the sample size at the corresponding time. Our approach also means that analysis can be performed on a weekly basis throughout the year, rather than only at the end of a year (or season) of data collection.</p><p id="p0030">In <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;3</xref> we plot trade-off curves showing the median fraction of responses excluded and the median relative change in the weekly incidence estimates as a function of &#x02018;Window size&#x02019; and &#x02018;Missing weeks allowed&#x02019;. This helps us to determine suitable parameter values for the selection criteria of consistent responses. For more information on how these effects vary throughout the year, see Figs.&#x000a0;3 and 4 in section B of the Supplementary Material.<fig id="fig0003"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Curves showing the fraction of responses excluded and the relative change in weekly incidence rate estimates for different choices of window size (text labels on the plot) and missing weeks allowed (panels left to right), for each of the three Symptom Groupings (colour of points and lines).</p></caption><alt-text id="at0003">Fig. 3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p><p id="p0031">Increasing the number of prior weeks for which a participant must have previously responded (the response window size) reduces the number of participants included in the &#x02018;consistent response&#x02019; subset for any given week &#x02014; that is, the fraction of responses excluded increases with increasing window size. Allowing respondents to have skipped some of the weeks in the consistent response window means that the responses of some participants are re-included in the consistent response subset.</p><p id="p0032">When we consider the impact of window size and missing weeks allowed on the incidence estimate we find that a more stringent (i.e.&#x000a0;larger) window size reduces the rate of symptom incidence calculated for any given week. This is expected from previous work looking at the impact of reporting bias <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The biggest jump is seen when requiring <italic>any</italic> response in the window prior to reporting symptom onset (i.e.&#x000a0;a one-week window, or a two-week window with one missing week allowed, or a three-week window with two missing weeks allowed). Imposing this minimal consistent response window results in an immediate decrease of approximately 5% in the incidence estimate for all Symptom Groupings. We attribute this initial decrease to a correction for the known symptom reporting bias &#x02014; if participants were equally likely to respond in a given week, independent of symptom incidence, then applying this criterion would not affect the estimated incidence rate.</p><p id="p0033">Increasing the consistent response window, beyond the minimum, initially causes a decrease in the number of consistent responses but does not significantly change incidence estimates. However, further increasing the window size beyond about four weeks causes both the number of consistent responses and the estimated incidence rate to decrease. We attribute this to the more stringent consistent response window introducing a different form of bias by increasing the over-representation of some groups of participants in the sample population &#x02014; specifically older P&#x00101;keh&#x00101;/NZ European cohorts who tend to have lower incidence rates &#x02014; see for example <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>.</p><p id="p0034">While our method allows for the user to choose any consistent respondent window size and any number of missed weeks within that, we have chosen in our subsequent analysis to use a window size of four weeks with up to one missing week. This defines a consistent response subset where small changes in the window size do not result in significant changes in the resulting incidence rate and where the fraction of responses included in the sample population for a given week is not too severely reduced, in part due to the fact that the Flutracking survey allows respondents to retrospectively enter results for up to four weeks into the past. We provide two examples of the selected values for window size and allowed missing responses using hypothetical response series illustrated in <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>.<fig id="fig0004"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Hypothetical examples for the selected window size of &#x02018;the previous 4 weeks&#x02019;, and allowing 1 missing response in that window.

Under-representation of lower socio-economic groups has also been noted within similar participatory surveys for Influenza. <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref></p><p id="p0038">The low response rate in Aotearoa New Zealand Flutracking data for ethnic groups other than P&#x00101;keha/NZ European, combined with the under-representation of lower socio-economic groups, mean that it is unlikely that the sampled population of non-P&#x00101;keh&#x00101; ethnicities in Flutracking is truly representative of those groups in the wider population. Therefore, weighting based on ethnicity alone may actually amplify selection biases rather than mitigating them. For this reason, although it is possible using our method, we do not calculate or re-weight symptom incidence by ethnicity. We note that the current re-weighting methodology is easily able to be applied to ethnicity or socio-economic status, should Flutracking enrolment be sufficiently broad that responses are representative of these groups. In order to avoid this limitation in future studies, we point to previous research on best practice for participatory surveillance data collection <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p id="p0039">The reference population used for the age weightings presented in this method is the 2021 Estimated Residential Population, calculated by Statistics NZ with 5-year age groups and spatial units of District Health Board (DHB) of residence <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, any other source of reference population data can be used, provided that it can be mapped on to the age (1-year age bands) and location (Aotearoa New Zealand postcode) groupings used in the Flutracking data. In general, it is better to use higher levels of aggregation (e.g. 5-year age groups) and DHB. This is in order to avoid the low response numbers per analysis unit, and consequent lower statistical power and increased uncertainty, that a more granular aggregation will lead to.</p><p id="p0040">In order to weight survey responses according to participant age, we use the rake function provided in R&#x02019;s survey package <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> to assign a weighting coefficient to each response.

Our method allows for analysis of arbitrary Symptom Groupings &#x02014; including two Symptom Groupings developed here for relevance to the COVID-19 response in Aotearoa New Zealand. Our method has several advantages over existing methods for analysis of similar data; namely that it defines a subset of consistent responses for use in calculating incidence estimates; and that it uses re-weighting of responses by participant sub-group in order to account for registration bias. Both of these adjustments increase the rigour and accuracy of the resulting incidence calculations, compared with methods in current use.

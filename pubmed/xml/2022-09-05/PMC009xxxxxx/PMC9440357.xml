In the new concept, partial splenic artery embolization (PSE) is considered the treatment of Medusae's face.

Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) are considered the treatment of Medusae's hair. Because portal venous pressure is associated with bleeding, it is important to reduce portal venous pressure to prevent rebleeding <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We have reported an emergency hybrid procedure that combines endoscopic treatment with PSE for bleeding esophagogastric varices <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

This time, we experienced an elective hybrid procedure combining endoscopic injection sclerotherapy with ligation (EISL) <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, left gastric artery embolization (LGE), and PSE. Left gastric arteriography (LGA) is a procedure that precedes LGE. Here, we report a case in which thrombus formation in gastric varices and cardiac branch of the left gastric vein just after EISL could be demonstrated by the venous phase of LGA.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><title>Case</title><p id="para0003">A 57-year-old male with hematemesis was referred to the department of surgery at our hospital.

Laboratory studies revealed hemoglobin 3.6 g/dL (normal range, 13.5-17.4); total leukocyte count 7550 /&#x003bc;L (3500-8000 /&#x003bc;L); platelet count 8.8&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>4</sup> /&#x003bc;L (12.3-33.1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>4</sup> /&#x003bc;L); total bilirubin 1.4 mg/dL (0.3-1.3 mg/dL); albumin 3.1 g/dL (3.8-5.0 g/dL); aspartate transaminase (AST) 116 U/L (10-32 U/L); alanine transaminase (ALT) 155 U/L (5-27 U/L); prothrombin time (PT) 47.6% (70%-130%); Mac-2 binding protein glycosylated isomers (M2BPGi) 4.61 COI (2+) (&#x0003c;1.00); serum ammonia (NH3) 24 &#x003bc;g/dL (12-66 &#x003bc;g/dL). The retention rate of indocyanine green at 15 minutes (ICG15) was 45% (&#x0003c;10%). The Child-Pugh score was 8 and the class was B. Hepatitis B surface antigen was negative.

Abdominal ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced CT showed liver cirrhosis with a small amount of ascites. 3D-CT demonstrated that the esophagogastric varices were supplied by the cardiac branch of the left gastric vein. The spleen volume was 204 ml, the liver volume was 1559 ml; giving a spleen/liver volume ratio of 0.13 (<xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>A). According to &#x0201c;splanchnic caput Medusae&#x0201d; concept <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, the spleen was regarded as her face and esophagogastric varices as her snake hairs.<fig id="fig0001"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Endoscopic picture before the hybrid procedure.

EISL, LGE, and PSE were performed consecutively under general anesthesia in the digital subtraction angiography (DSA) room. In EISL, a total of 2.5 ml of 5% ethanolamine oleate (5%EO) with iopamidol was injected into the cardiac branch of the left gastric vein for 10 minutes under fluoroscopy (<xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;3</xref>A and B).

Hepatic venous cannulation via the right antecubital vein was performed. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was 14 mmHg (normal range, 1-5 mmHg). The venous phase of celiac arteriography just after EISL demonstrated that the left gastric vein trunk was visualized away from the liver (<xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>A).

The para-esophageal vein and lesser curvature branch of the left gastric vein were not affected. The left gastric vein trunk was visualized towards the liver. According to these findings, the blood flow direction of the left gastric vein trunk was angiographically diagnosed as a bi-directional pattern. In this case, splenomegaly was not evident. PSE was performed for the treatment of thrombocytopenia. However, it seemed difficult to expect the portal decompression effect only by PSE. Because the involvement of left gastric artery blood flow in the formation of esophagogastric varices was considered to be significant, LGE was performed using microcoils (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figs.&#x000a0;5</xref>A and B).

The pharmacological effect of 5%EO on blood coagulation and vascular damage in dogs has been reported <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. 5% EO destroys the endothelial cells of the vessel of the dog 30 seconds after injection into the vessels. The site of the destroyed endothelial cells is covered with fibrin 5 minutes after the injection of 5%EO. Two hours after the injection, red blood cells and fibrin accumulate on the damaged vessels. Mural thrombus occludes the bloodstream 24 hours after the injection. With EIS alone, variceal blood flow resumes just after injection of 5%EO, so it takes time to occlude varices and their feeders by thrombus. On the other hand, because variceal blood flow is blocked with EISL, it has been considered that occlusion by thrombus in variceal feeders is formed just after EISL. However, there were no reports that could prove thrombus formation just after EISL. In this case, thrombus formation in gastric varices and cardiac branch just after EISL could be demonstrated by the venous phase of LGA (<xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;4</xref>B).</p><p id="para0011">Endoscopic varicography <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> is useful to identify the variceal feeders in which 5%EO with iopamidol is retrogradely injected. However, it is difficult to prove thrombus formation by endoscopic varicography only. Percutaneous transhepatic portography <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> is useful to evaluate thrombus formation after endoscopic therapy; however, it is invasive. Its use is limited to elective and in special cases. Contrast-enhanced CT and 3D-CT reconstruction image are useful for assessing blood flow alterations, but it lacks resolution. The first advantage of LGA is that it is included in the hybrid procedure and can be evaluated just after EISL. The 2nd advantage is that it has a high resolution. The 3rd advantage is that the blood flow direction of the main trunk of the left gastric vein can be evaluated. The 4th advantage is that LGE can be added.</p><p id="para0012">Portal venous pressure is directly correlated with variceal bleeding <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Because direct portal pressure measurement is invasive, HVPG is measured as an alternative. Rebleeding can be prevented by setting the HVPG to 12 mmHg or less <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">2]</xref>. PSE not only increases platelet count but also reduces the portal venous pressure, splenic venous blood flow volume and spleen/liver volume ratio <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. We have reported the advantages of the hybrid procedure combining endoscopic treatment and PSE for esophagogastric varices <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, in this case, splenomegaly was not evident and it seemed difficult to expect the portal decompression effect only by PSE. Because the involvement of left gastric artery blood flow in the formation of esophagogastric varices was considered to be significant, LGE was added. Actually, HVPG decreased from 14 to 11 mmHg immediately after LGE and PSE.</p><p id="para0013">Hemodynamic effects of the left gastric artery on esophageal varices have been reported <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9</xref>,<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">10]</xref>. The direction of blood flow in the main trunk of the left gastric vein is important in considering the cause of esophagogastric varices. Hepatopetal or bi-directional LGV blood flow pattern indicates the involvement of left gastric artery blood flow as the cause of esophagogastric varices. Control of LGA hemodynamics may be useful for the suppression of variceal recurrence. In the future, for esophagogastric varices without splenomegaly, we would like to actively evaluate portal hemodynamics by LGA and HVPG to establish the indication for LGE.</p><p id="para0014">PHG was also improved after the hybrid procedure in this case. A high incidence of PHG is observed in patients with severe liver dysfunction, with a high HVPG, and who have undergone endoscopic treatment with sclerotherapy <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. LGE and PSE decreased HVPG and it may have contributed to the improvement of PHG.</p><p id="para0015">The hybrid procedure combining EISL with LGE and PSE was effective for the treatment of esophagogastric varices with PHG. We conclude that the venous phase of LGA is useful for evaluating thrombus formation just after EISL for esophagogastric varices.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list

(AmB) and Thymus Essential Oil (TEO) and test their effectiveness in the treatment of fungal-infected human adipose
stem cells (hASCs).
</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>In this experimental study, optimal formulation of AmB and TEO loaded lipo-niosome (based
on lipid-surfactant thin-film hydration method) was chemically, and biologically characterized. Therefore, encapsulation
capacity, drug release, size, and the survival rate of cells with different concentrations of free and encapsulated AmB/
TEO were evaluated using the MTT method, and its antifungal activity was compared with conventional AmB.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> Lipo-Niosome containing Tween 60 surfactant: cholesterol: Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC):
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) with a ratio of 20:40:60:3 were chosen as optimal formulation. Lipo-Niosomes entrapment
efficiency was 94.15%. The drug release rate after 24 hours was 52%, 54%, and 48% for Lipo-AmB, Lipo-TEO, and
Lipo-AmB/TEO, respectively. Physical and chemical characteristics of the Lipo-Niosomes particles indicated size
of 200 nm and a dispersion index of 0.32 with a Zeta potential of -24.56 mv. Furthermore, no chemical interaction
between drugs and nano-carriers was observed. The cell viability of adipose mesenchymal stem cells exposed to 50
&#x003bc;g/ml of free AmB, free TEO, and free AmB/TEO was 13.4, 58, and 36.9%, respectively. Whereas the toxicity of the
encapsulated formulas of these drugs was 48.9, 70.8, and 58.3% respectively. The toxicity of nanoparticles was very
low (8.5%) at this concentration. Fluorescence microscopic images showed that the antifungal activity of Lipo-AmB/
TEO was significantly higher than free formulas of AmB, TEO, and AmB/TEO.

especially fungal diseases to increase the effectiveness
of drugs and reduce their side effects. Fungal diseases
are important in three aspects: infection, mortality, and
economic losses. These infections threaten almost all
patients, especially children who use stem cell transplants.
The prevalence of invasive candidiasis in these patients is
about 70-80%, and the resulting mortality is reported to
be about 60-90% (1).</p><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells that are important for making and
repairing skeletal tissues, such as cartilage, bone, and nerve cell lineages. The MSC is
found in various tissues such as bone marrow, amniotic fluid, cord blood, and other mesoderm
tissues. These types of cells can grow, multiply, and differentiate for generations in the
laboratory while maintaining the stable morphology and natural state of their chromosomes
(2). Patients with MSC transplant recipients are at high risk for invasive fungal infections
(IFIs). Over the past two decades, the number of patients at risk of fungal infections has
increased after using MSC to treat cancer. Dominant organisms that cause IFIs include
<italic>Candida spp., Aspergillus spp.,</italic> and Mucorales molds (3, 4). Among the
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients, about 86% were due to
molds, and 14% were due to yeasts. The majority of mold infections, about 94%, were caused
by Aspergillus species (5).</p><p>One of the most common complications of stem
cell transplantation is the suppression of the immune
system following the administration of corticosteroids and nosocomial infections, which can lead to a variety
of diseases, especially bacterial and fungal infections.
To prevent and treat these diseases, especially fungal
agents, Amphotericin B (AmB) is used. Although free
administration of this drug has several side effects on
kidney, liver, lungs, and the body&#x02019;s hematopoietic system,
yet AmB is considered a golden treatment against these
fungal infections in the patient treated with hASCs. The
drug binds to the fungal cell membrane and induces the
pores in the membranes leading to ions leakage, and
microorganisms death (6).
</p><p>One possible approach to reduce the side effects of AmB
is to use the essential oils of herbs. In recent years, there
has been a growing tendency toward herbal medicines.
The main advantages of cost-effective herbal medicines
are good safety and their fewer side effects (7). The
essential oils of medicinal plants, especially thyme, can
be a good alternative to chemical drugs with antifungal
and antibacterial properties. It has been also shown that
Essential Oil (TEO) can inhibit the pathogenicity of
microorganisms such as Candida albicans, Clostridium,
and Bactericides fragilis (8).</p><p>Another way to reduce the side effects of these drugs is
to use drug delivery nanocarriers. The goal of researchers
in the synthesis and optimization of drug delivery is to
design a system for proper drug loading, optimal release
properties, short half-life, and less toxicity (9). Nanocarrier
containing AmB bind to the fungal cell and facilitate
the slow release of drug molecules into the fungus cell
membrane as well as infected hASCs (10). Diezi and Kwon
(11), fabricated cholesterol-combined AmB PEG-DSPE
micelles that met the safety and solubility requirements of
AmB and reduced toxicity at the membrane level for the
treatment of life-threatening systemic fungi. Walsh et al.
(12), also encapsulated AmB in liposomal and found that
the nano-drug delivery system increased its therapeutic
effect and decreased its side effects.
</p><p>Using advanced <italic>in vitro </italic>methods, Mostafavi et al. (13), investigated the
effect of AmB in combination with selenium, free and loaded inside the nano niosome, on
<italic>Leishmania tropica (L. tropica)</italic>. Using the MTT method, macrophage model,
flow cytometry, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), cytotoxicity and
efficiency of the niosomic formula were investigated, and no toxicity was found for niosomal
forms of the compound. Alam et al. (14), also developed a niosomal drug nanosystem
containing diallyl sulfide in combination with garlic oil, and the results showed that the
niosomic form of the drugs significantly reduced the activity of Candida albicans and animal
death compared to its free form. In addition, histopathological studies showed that the
niosomal showed no toxic effects, and fewer hyphae were observed in C. Albicans biosystems
treated with SLAmB niosomes compared to free AmB (15).</p><p>Nano-carrier of liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB)
in the transplantation setting has increased the rate of
therapeutic achievement of fungal infections with a
suitable safety profile (12). In recent decades, niosomes
have been considered by researchers as a suitable carrier
for drug delivery, and in some cases, it has been reported
that this carrier can be a suitable alternative to liposomal
nanocarriers (16). A promising method for reducing
side effects and effective drug treatment is the use of
nano niosomes, which are an excellent alternative to
trapping hydrophobic drugs due to their high efficiency,
biodegradation, and biocompatibility. In addition, they
have good stability, low preparation cost and are easy to
store (17). </p><p>Sharma et al. (17) used the Niosome system to study
the effect of co-delivery of curcumin and doxorubicin on
the Hela (human cervical cancer) cell line. Studies of two
combinations of curcumin and doxorubicin showed that
curcumin is located in the lipid layer, while doxorubicin
is trapped in the hydrophilic part of the noisome.
Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that in the
membrane environment, AmB interacts with ergosterol,
3-4 times stronger interactions than in solution. The
AmB-cholesterol bonding is weaker compared with
ergosterol not only because of the weaker van der Waals
(vdW) interactions but also because of entropy decrease
associated with a reduction in the structural flexibility of
the sterol side-chain (8). Zhou et al. (18), examined the
effectiveness of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells
(uMSCs) on corneal scarring. They used natamycin for
the prevention and treatment of fungal keratitis. Although
liposomes have been widely studied as promising
carriers of proteins, drugs, and DNA, one of the major
problems with using these nanocarriers for drug delivery
is their non-specificity, which causes their removal by
reticuloendothelial systems (19).</p><p>Studies of mineral and metal-based nanoparticles
for drug delivery have shown that some nanoparticles
cause toxicity to normal cells. For example, amorphous
silica nanoparticles can cause inflammatory reactions
on target organs resulting in apoptotic cell death (20).
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been reported to cause
toxicity in normal cells. CNTs react with living cells to
produce reactive oxygen species causing mitochondrial
dysfunction and lipid peroxidation (21). It has been
shown that mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for
targeted drug delivery in the size range of 50-100 nm
with a positive charge accumulate mainly in the liver
after intravenous injection (22).</p><p>Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of
AmB and TEO loaded in Lipo-Niosomes on fungalinfected stem cells. In the present study, the lipidbased lipo-Niosome formula was optimized for further
binding to the fungal wall ergosterol and the codelivery of two antifungal drug combinations including
AmB and TEO based on diffusion parameters, size,
and trapping percentage. This model is for the transfer
of hydrophobic compounds (especially the use of
essential oils of medicinal plants) to reduce the dose
and side effects of the chemical drug AmB and to
increase their effectiveness on fungal-infected hASCs. The experiment aimed to develop Lipo-Niosomes
nanoparticles loaded with AmB and TEO and test their
effectiveness for the development of an anti-fungal
system favorable for hASCs. We hypothesized that
due to their poor stability and low solubility in water,
the AmB and TEO will be loaded in the hydrophobic
part of the Lipo-Niosomes and be released slowly after
contacting the fungal cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Ethics approval for the current laboratory study was

weighing the required materials, they were dissolved in chloroform in a round bottom pot,
and rotated (150 rpm/minute), to form a thin lipid film. Then, to prepare the Nanocarrier,
the lipid film was hydrated with distilled water at 60&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes. Finally, 10 mol
of Lipo-Niosomes with different concentrations were formed to load hydrophobic drugs. To
reduce the size of the Lipo-Niosomes, the probe of the sonication device was placed in the
colloidal solution of the niosomes in the ice bath, and then the sonication process was
performed to produce smaller niosomes for 55 minutes (15 seconds: on and 10 seconds: off
with a power of 100 watts). To separate the larger particles from the smaller particles
and sterilize the Nanocarrier, a syringe filter was used (23). The prepared Lipo-Niosome
was stored at 4&#x000b0;C for further studies. The ratio of materials composition to each material
of cholesterol, Tween 60, DPPC, and PEG has been calculated (equal to 3.2, 4.6, 2.3, and
20.1 mol, respectively) and the ratio of drug composition to each drug has been
calculated, AmB 2.6 mol and TEO equal 1.6 mol (Table 1). </p></sec><sec><title>Essential oil extraction method</title><p>After purchasing thyme seeds, 100 g of seeds were

</title><p>The morphology of hydrated Lipo-Niosomes loaded with
AmB and TEO dispersions was examined by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM, Zeiss EM10C-100 VK). The
Lipo-Niosomes size and distribution were determined by
dynamic light scattering (DLS, Malvern zen-3600-England).
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Model 8300,

Due to the sensitivity of stem cells and the lethality of Candida fungal strains, first,
Lipo-Niosomes containing AmB and TEO with different concentrations (5, 10, 25, 50, 100,
150, 250, 500 &#x003bc;g/ml) in cells culture medium were added. Candida was then added to the
cell-containing medium, free drugs, and nanocarriers containing the drug. In this method,
the effect on cells was evaluated in different ways for 24 to 72 hours. The Alomar Blue
colorimetric assay was used to evaluate drug sensitivity to fungal strains and cell
viability. The optimized nanocarrier structure includes cholesterol, DPPC, and PEG, which
play an important role in binding to fungal cells and stem cell membranes. The higher the
percentage of these compounds, especially cholesterol and phospholipid, the connection
will be longer and more stable.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical data analyses were performed using the
student t-test to compare the differences between
groups. The quality of fitting was performed by R2 (28),
and nonlinear regression analysis was evaluated via
MATLAB software (version 7.8). The relative standard

amount of standard solutions in the concentration range
was analyzed by UV spectroscopy at the characteristic
value of &#x003bb; max with the standard curve of drugs. On the
other hand, drug entrapment and drug release, the effect
of fungi on cells and the effect of drugs on fungal growth
in different groups were performed for 24 to 72 hours.
The results of the analysis showed that in all triplicate

(data not shown). For finding the optimal formulation
capable of high drug trapping efficiency, controlled
release at 37&#x000b0;C physiological pH=7.4, and increasing
the effectiveness of optimization were performed. After
forming a thin lipid film for nanocarrier, it was exposed
to 4&#x000b0;C for 24 hours to ensure complete removal of the
solvent, the lipid thin film was exposed to 4&#x000b0;C for 24
hours. The AmB and TEO were encapsulated as antifungal
agents in Lipo-Niosomes-based vesicles. The structure of
Lipo-Niosomes including Tween 60: cholesterol: DPPC:
PEG at 20:40:60:3 ratio was considered as a model for the
delivery of several hydrophobic drugs. </p><p>In this study, Lipo-Niosomes contained AmB1.08&#x000d7;10<sup>-6</sup> mol, TEO

were formed. The ratio of materials composition to each material of Cholesterol, Tween 60,
DPPC, and PEG was calculated (equal to 3.2, 4.6, 2.3, and 20.1 mol, respectively). To
prepare Lipo-Niosomes with hydrophobic molecules, AmB 1.08&#x000d7;10<sup>-6</sup> mol and TEO
1.8&#x000d7;10<sup>-6</sup> mol was added to the initial chloroform solution. Lipo-Niosomes
formulations were formed with controlled release, and high entrapment efficiency
parameters. Details of the Lipo-Niosomes preparation were: 2.88&#x000d7;10<sup>-6</sup> mol total
weight of drugs, 3.23&#x000d7;10<sup>-4</sup> mol Lipo-Niosomes empty, and 112.15 mol is the
vesicle ratio to drugs (Table 1). AmB and TEO molecules were placed in the hydrophobic
part of the lipo-Niosome due to their hydrophobic properties. As a result, the drug
entrapment rate in the nanocarrier was 94.15% and the release of AmB and TEO in the first
24 hours was 52% and 54%, respectively Their combined release from the nanocarrier was 48%
in 24 hours, the nanosystem size was 200 nm and the zeta potential was -24.56 mv .This
formula was selected as the most suitable formula. The Co-encapsulation of both
hydrophobic drugs increased the total antifungal molecules loaded into the Nano-carrier
bilayers, entrapment efficiencies and the effectiveness of the AmB/TEO in Lipo-Niosomes
increased compared to the free samples. Optimized formulations after 60 days of storage,
did not change significantly from the freshly prepared samples confirming stability after
long-term storage. Finally, after choosing the optimal formula, their effects on Candida
and fungal-infected hASCs were evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic>. </p></sec><sec><title>Morphology and evaluation of drug interactions</title><p>The morphology of hydrated Lipo-Niosomes dispersions was examined by TEM. The structures

TEM, blank Lipo-Niosome (100 nm), and Co-drugs loaded in lipo-Niosome [AmB-TEO, 200 nm)]
was slightly smaller than that measured by DLS (220 nm, Fig.1A-C). To investigate the
presence of chemical interactions between Multi-drugs Nanocarrier AmB, TEO, and unloaded
Lipo-Niosomes, FTIR spectral data were obtained. The FTIR template for Lipo-Niosomal
AmB-TEO showed different characteristic peaks of DPPC, cholesterol, Tween 60, and
DSPE-MPEG in the range of 3400-1115 cm<sup>-1</sup>. All peaks were repeated in the FTIR
spectrum of blank Lipo-Niosomes, Lipo-Niosomes AmB, and Lipo-Niosomes TEO. peak of 1070
cm<sup>-1</sup> is due to the C=O asymmetrical stretching vibrations of AmB (29). All
peaks were also observed in the spectrum of the single drug encapsulation of AmB and TEO;
As a result, the FTIR results confirmed the conjugation of AmB and TEO with
Lipo-Niosomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Entrapment efficiency and drug release study</title><p>UV-visible spectroscopy for the determination of the
free drugs was used in Lipo-Niosomes vesicles (Fig.2A).
Free drugs have typical absorptions in the UV-visible

at 370,388,407 nm, TEO 225 nm, and AmBisome&#x000ae; 325
nm (AmB Liposomal as standard, Fig.2B). UV-visible
of AmB at 380, 400, 417 nm, and TEO 275 nm in LipoNiosomes were determined. As a result of the increase
in the wavelength of the nanocarrier, it indicated that the drugs have been loaded into the Lipo-Niosomes. UV-spectra
of AmBisome&#x000ae; 325 nm and Lipo-Niosomes AmB/TEO
compositions (295, 380, 405 nm) are shown, and considering
the wavelengths of the drug compound loaded in the lipoNiosome and the AmBisome, it is concluded that the present
nanocarrier is similar to the standard nanocarrier [AmBisome
(Fig.2C)]. As a result, the UV-visible spectra can be employed
to analyze the degree of aggregation of AmB/TEO in LipoNiosomes conjugate (30).</p><p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> release of AmB and TEO from Lipo-Niosomes was investigated
using a dialysis method and PBS as a running buffer at different time points at 37&#x000b0; C and

54%, after 24 hours and 54%, and 57% after 72 hours, respectively. Whereas, co-drugs were
released after 24 hours 48% and after 72 hours 52%. As a result, the release of drugs

free and combined AmB and TEO (Fig.3A). Free drugs had
the greatest effect on the diameter of the growth inhibition
zone in the first 24 hours. Drug concentrations decreased
over time and as a result, the diameter of the fungal area
decreased. Candida albicans growth aura diameter, which
is more prevalent, after prescription of AmB, TEO, and
their combination were 45,40, and 51 mm in the first 24
hours, 42.5, 37.6, and 47.8 mm in 48 hours:, and, 40.5,
36.6, and 44.8 mm in 72 hours, respectively.</p><p>This shows that free drugs affect quickly, and
their effect soon wears off, so the fungi grow again
(P&#x0003c;0.05). In the second stage, Candida strains were
treated with encapsulated drugs (Fig.3B). In the first
24 hours, the drugs were less effective, but over time,
the effectiveness increased. The diameters of the
inhibition zone of different Candida species increased.
After the prescription of AmB and TEO encapsulated
in lipo-Niosome, the diameter of the Candida albicans
area in the first 24 hours was 20.7mm and after 72
hours reached 22.7mm (P&#x0003c;0.05). Therefore, the drugs
were slowly released from the nanocarrier (Fig.3) (26).
For MIC, free drugs used in the cultured medium were
in the range of 0.56 to 0.86 &#x003bc;g/ml (AmB) and 0.98 to
1.46 &#x003bc;g/ml (TEO), but when placed in Lipo-Niosomes,
their MIC was about 0.83 to 1.42 &#x003bc;g/ml, while for MIC
AmBisome was 0.78 to 1.5 &#x003bc;g/0 ml (30). With the

to 1.5 &#x003bc;g/ml AmB and 1.5 &#x003bc;g/ml TEO) caused toxicity in
these cells. The cell death rates due to AmB, TEO, and a combination of AmB/TEO were 85%, 35%, and 70%,
respectively. At this stage, the rate of cell death was
compared with the control group (cells and fungi) and
this mortality increased with higher doses of drugs. On
the other hand, over time from 24 to 72 hours, as the
concentration of the drugs decreased, the cells began
to grow again (Fig.5A1, 2), which is consistent with
the study of Kami&#x00144;ski et al. (10).
</p><p>As shown in Figure 5B1, the fungus has begun to

cells got an opportunity to grow again. By comparing

the cells were marked. In the second stage, cells and
drugs encapsulated were examined with fungi. At this
stage, the cells become infected with the fungus, and
during the first 24 hours, the fungi stop growing, but
after some time (72 hours) and the slow release of the
drugs, we see a decrease in the concentration of the
fungus (Fig.5C, D). This is consistent with the studies
of Moen et al. (32), and Tollemar et al. (33). LipoNiosome containing drugs at a concentration of 100
&#x003bc;g / ml (equivalent to ~ 3 &#x003bc;g AmB and 3 &#x003bc;g essential

showed that the survival percentage of stem cells treated

showed that the lethal effect of TEO on cells during
the experiment was less than that of AmB. However,
observations about the use of higher concentrations of
AmB and TEO encapsulated in the lipo-Niosome had
very little lethal effect compared to the control group,

one of the predominant organisms that cause these infections. Despite the diagnosis of these
risk factors, attention to IFI in stem cell transplantation is underestimated, because
several patients die without identifying the causes of the disease, especially fungal agents
(34). It is worth noticing that all IFIs appeared in autologous hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (<italic>HSCT</italic>) recipients immediately after transplantation, while
patients receiving allogeneic HSCT are at risk even after 100 days (5). IFI is one of the
leading causes of increased morbidity and mortality among patients with hematologic
malignancies, particularly in those affected by acute myeloid leukemia, and in those who do
hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Although more attention has been focused on identifying
risk factors or prognosis in recipients of HSCT, few efforts have been made to assess the
true IFI incidence (35).</p><p>Liposomal nanocarriers containing AmB (LAmB) have
been used for many years to treat fungal infections and
have been approved by the FDA, but have challenges
such as instability, maintenance, and cost-effectiveness,
while optimized Lipo-Niosomes are less challenging. As
a result, the nanocarrier easily attaches to the fungal wall,
and after the ions removing from the fungal membrane,
it destroys them, these results are similar to studies by,
Walsh et al. (12), Cordonnier et al. (36), Alam et al. (14),
Mostafavi et al. (13). The advantage of this nanocarrier is
its low toxicity and effectiveness because TEO essential
oil has good antifungal activity and can be a good
alternative to amphotericin. </p><p>Due to the stated challenges liposomes, Lipo-Niosomes
have attracted the attention of many researchers and
pharmaceutical companies. They are biocompatible,
biodegradable, non-immunogenic, and non-toxic and can
entrapment lots of material in relatively smaller volumes
compared to other vesicles. The use of this nanocarrier
improves the stability and pharmacokinetics of the
drug, reduces the side effects of drugs, and increases
the therapeutic effects. Also, they are easier and cheaper
to prepare, store, and transport (37). The present LipoNiosomes are non-toxic, stable, biodegradable and
inexpensive compared to liposomes.</p><p>Antifungal molecules attach to ergosterol after being
exposed to the fungal membrane and extract it. The drugergosterol interaction is stronger and more stable than
the drug-cholesterol because it is attributed to the double
bond and the methyl group in sterol (10). The use of this
nanocarrier improves the stability and pharmacokinetics
of the drug, reduces the side effects of the drugs, and
increases the effectiveness. Also, they are easier to prepare,
store, transport, and trap a wider range of drugs (37). We
tried to use the essential oils of medicinal plants with a
similar and suitable effect. On the other hand, abundance,
cheaper, fewer side effects are some of the advantages of
these plant metabolites. They reduce the concentration of
AmB, and even after release from the nanocarrier do not
affect healthy cells in the body.</p><p>The morphology of cultured stem cells was assessed.
According to a study by Kami&#x00144;ski (10), although the lipoNiosome may bind to the membrane of these cells, the
ability of the lipo-Niosome to bind to the ergosterol of the
fungal wall is stable and stronger. On the other hand, the
AmB drug forms a large agglomerate after being exposed
to fungal membranes, then binds to ergosterol and extracts
it. In this process, strong interaction between ergosterol
and AmB drug is very important and based on the surface
absorption of AmB drug in which antibiotic molecules
are oriented parallel to the surface of the lipid, causing
separation of ergosterol from the membrane surface of
fungi and their structural instability. According to a study
by Diezi and Kwon (11) the AmB-ergosterol interaction is
stronger than AmB-cholesterol because it is attributed to
the double bond and the methyl group in this sterol, and
this particular atomic pattern is responsible for the better
matching of the AmB heptane chain to ergosterol.</p><p>The amphiphilic nature of niosomes also causes
permeability, solubility, increased absorption, reduced
toxicity, and other side effects. UV-visible spectroscopy
was used to determine the formation of the AmBLiponiosome-TEO combination. Co-encapsulation of
AmB and TEO have typical absorptions in the UV-visible
region with characteristic peaks at 295, 380, and 405 nm
with different concentrations (0.06,0.07, and 0.1). The
AmBisome&#x000ae; (Standard liposomal AmB) spectrum also
shows a characteristic peak at 325 nm with a concentration
of 0.12. As a result, the almost identical wavelengths
and concentrations of the two nanocarriers confirm the
formation of the Liponiosome.</p><p>In this research, the main limitations associated with
the use of AmB and TEO, especially amphotericin B, for
antifungal therapy such as low water solubility, toxicity,
and hemolytic potential were eliminated by conjugating the
drug to Lipo-Niosome. It was found that these molecules
were monomers in the conjugate and did not aggregate.
The slow and continuous release of AmB and TEO from
nanocarrier has a considerable role in increasing its halflife if used systemically which corresponds with the study
of Gurudevan et al. (38).</p><p>Due to the structure of the fungal wall, the lipo-Niosome
with compounds including Dppc: Chol: Tween60: PEG for
proper and stable binding to the ergosterol of the fungal
wall was investigated and finally an optimal formulation
was obtained. The morphology of the selected nanocarriers
containing a complex of two drug compounds, Am B and
TEO, was performed by TEM. The size of the drug-free
nanocarrier is close to 100 nanometers, but when the drug
molecules were loaded into it, the size of the nanosystem
reached about 200 nanometers, indicating that the drugs
were properly loaded into the lipo-Niosome. In this case,
the morphology of the nanocarrier is visible as a sphere with
separate borders and a smooth surface.</p><p>Drug release from the optimized lipo-Niosome was evaluated at pH=7.4 and 37&#x000b0;C by the physiological
conditions of the body. As demonstrated, the essential oil
has more release due to higher loading, and this release
of drug molecules and essential oil during different hours
shows that the nanosystem can release slowly and in a
controlled manner. Also, the formulation prepared under
physiological conditions has a favorable, continuous, and
slow release. The release of AmB and TEO from LipoNiosome was very similar to the release observed in the
case of AmBisome&#x000ae; and the study of Gurudevan et al.
(38), suggesting that the conjugated pharmacokinetic
profile in case of intravenous injection, would probably be
similar to AmBisome&#x000ae;. Drug release rates after 24 hours
were 48% for AmB-Lipo-TEO, whereas the release of
AmB in AmBisome&#x000ae; and AmB-albumin conjugates was
45% and 48% at 24 hours, respectively. As a result, this
optimized model was much similar to the release from
AmBisome&#x000ae; and the study of Gurudevan et al. (38), and
therefore could be fitted into this model.</p><p>Since the encapsulation in the present study has a similar <italic>in vitro</italic>
release profile as that of AmBisome&#x000ae; and AmB-albumin conjugates, it is reasonable to assume
that the conjugated pharmacokinetic properties <italic>in vivo</italic> are similar to AmBisome&#x000ae;. Although,
this formulation must be confirmed by <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Also, in this study,
for early detection of the effectiveness of drugs loaded in this nanocarrier, for the
treatment of candidiasis, the antifungal disk diffusion method was used, which is consistent
with the results of studies by M.T. Blanco et al. (26). The antifungal susceptibility of
AmB-LiponiosomeTEO than AmBisome&#x000ae; was evaluated as a reference for Candida strains. Since
AmB is widely used against fungal infections of candidiasis, the AmB-Liponiosome-TEO
combination was evaluated for its anti-fungal efficacy against this strain. The minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for AmB-Liponiosome-TEO combination (0.83 to 1.42 &#x003bc;g/ml), and
AmBisome&#x000ae; (0.78 to 1.50) &#x003bc;g/ml) against the candida were determined. Interestingly, MIC
values of AmB/TEO in the conjugate were similar to the MIC values of AmBisome&#x000ae; (38), as a
result, the present nanocarrier has a good antifungal effect.</p><p>Due to the chemical structure of AmB and TEO, they were placed in the hydrophobic section
of nano-carriers. Hydrophobic molecules are non-polar and therefore tend to other non-polar
molecules and solvents. Interestingly, free and encapsulated molecules of TEO showed less
toxicity than AmB with and without loading in LipoNiosomes (30). The diameters of the growth
inhibition zone of different Candida species were determined in 24, 48, and 72 hours
<italic>in vitro</italic>. Fungal strains were assayed after culture with AmB, TEO, and
their combination in liposuction. In the first 24 hours the encapsulated drugs showed the
least effect due to the lack of release from the nanocarrier and after 72 hours with the
release of the drugs, they showed the greatest effectiveness, while free drugs had the
greatest effect in the first 24 hours and their effectiveness disappeared after 72 hours.
Growth area diameter was after prescription of Lipo-Niosomal (AmB/ TEO combination) in 24
hours, 20.7 mm, 24.5 mm in 48 hours, and 72 hours, 26.5 mm were determined. This indicates
that the encapsulated drugs have a long effect, so the fungi do not have a chance to grow
again. In this study, the effect of Candida fungus on stem cells and the effectiveness of
AmB and TEO drugs, and encapsulated in Lipo-Niosome with concentrations different were
evaluated. Free drugs were quick to take effect and their effects soon disappeared, but
loaded drugs due to slowrelease, continuous effects, as well as more appropriate efficacy
appeared. After the effectiveness of the drugs, the diameter of fungi decreased
significantly and showed that the drug and essential oil have a good effect on these fungi.
As a result, the standard strain of Candida Albicans had a certain sensitivity and according
to the results, obtained in disk diffusion, TEO has similar antifungal effects as AmB. It is
concluded that the TEO contains an effective substance capable of preventing the growth of
fungal compared to the drug AmB. </p><p><italic>In vitro</italic>, their toxicity, cell viability, and efficacy on fungal-infected
stem cells were investigated. Nanocarriers containing drugs are attached to the ergosterol
in the fungal cell wall by cholesterol, and drug molecules are slowly released into the
fungus cell membrane (8, 39, 40). The AmB and TEO molecules are placed in the hydrophobic
part of the Nano-carrier due to poor stability and low solubility in water. They are
released slowly after attaching the Lipo-Niosomes to the fungus wall, but free drugs affect
quickly, and their effect wears off quickly. The morphology of cells and fungi underwent
significant changes, including a decrease and increase in volume, Spherical and
spindle-shaped, cell transplantation, decrease and increase in the concentration of fungi.
Images obtained using a reverse microscope showed that in early culture the cells had a
spindle and polyhedral morphology (spindle-shaped cells had a higher growth rate than other
cells and formed the highest cell percentage after the first passage).</p><p>Our goal is to produce nanoparticles based on LipoNiosome loaded with AmB, thymus essential
oil, and evaluated their effectiveness in treating human adiposederived stem cells infected
with the fungus. As a result, study and imaging of the effects of drugs on fungal infected
cells, reduction of fungal strain concentration after drug administration, and stem cell
regrowth show that this nanocarrier is effective in inhibiting the growth of fungi in cell
culture medium. Similar to the present system, the liposome nanocarrier contains AmB (LAmB),
which has been used for many years to treat fungal infections and has been approved by the
FDA. On the other hand, inspired by the LAmB nanocarrier that treats them after attaching to
the fungal wall, the lipo-Niosome nanocarrier (27, 32-36) which has a liposome-like
structure can attach to the fungal wall. As a result, the use of this nanocarrier<italic> in
vitro </italic>causes growth inhibition, reduction of fungal concentration and cell
regrowth (microscopic results). In this study, Am B which has many side effects, was loaded
complex with TEO in a new nanocarrier, to reduce the dose, reduce the side effects of this
chemical drug, and reducing cellular stress. This review tried to compensate for the
deficiency of various vitamins and minerals created by cell transplantation through the
essential oil of the medicinal plant, and also increased the effectiveness or synergy of the
drug with this process. </p><p>Therefore, it can be concluded that the present system,
after the animal and clinical tests and FDA approval
can be a good alternative to liposome containing AmB,
because we tried to use the essential oil of a medicinal
plant with similar and suitable effectiveness, more
abundant, cheaper, with fewer side effects, and reduce the
concentration of AmB which has side effects on the body
cells even after release from the nanocarrier. Innovation of
present study, Optimization of a new formulation for Codelivery of two antifungal drug combinations including
AmB and TEO based on release parameters, size, and
percentage of entrapment has been done. This model is
for the delivery of hydrophobic combinations (especially
the use of medicinal plant essential oil) to reduce the
dose and side effects of the chemical drug AmB for the
effectiveness on fungal-infected stem cells. We introduce
a model similar to LAmB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>One of the side effects of AmB is moderate to severe
anemia and cessation of red blood cell production,
which can be solved by the prescription of TEO. In this
optimized formula, we optimized the Lipid level in such
a way that in addition to transferring the Multi-drug
compounds, it could be properly attached to the ergosterol
of the fungal cell membrane. And causes the stability of
Nanocarriers during the binding and slow release of drug
molecules. The proposed formula provided potential
benefits, including smooth spherical surface morphology,
sustained release, high entrapment efficiency (94.15%),
the release of Lipo-AmB/TEO (24 hours=48%), and size
(200 &#x000b1; 20 nm), polydispersity index (0.32 &#x000b1; 3), and Zeta
(-24.56 mv). Free drug molecules, at a concentration of
50 &#x003bc;g/ml cause cell death, however by encapsulating
them at a concentration of 100 micrograms per milliliter,
the survival rate of the cells is increased. The proposed
nanocarrier provides an obvious understanding of the
Lipo-Niosomes formulation as a successful system based
on surfactant and lipid for the Co-delivery of antifungal
agents in stem cells. This method can be an appropriate
alternative to AmB liposomal.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Dr. Naeini Head of the

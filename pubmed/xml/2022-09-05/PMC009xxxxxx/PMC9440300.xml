A national survey collaboration network was established for this study. The cross-sectional survey was conducted between July 1, 2020, and July 1, 2021. With the help of local governments and health commissions, Tier 2/3 hospitals in mainland China were invited to participate in the survey. The investigation is a non-mandatory questionnaire. Finally, a total of 5460 departments providing ultrasound diagnosis in mainland China were voluntarily enrolled, including 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities. The number of Tier 3 hospitals and Tier 2 hospitals in mainland China in 2021 was 2996 and 10,404, respectively, according to data from the National Health Commission of China.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The overall sample size of the survey reached 40.7% of the total number of 2/3 hospitals in mainland China.</p></sec><sec id="sec0007"><title>Survey indicator design</title><p id="para0016">The indicators were discussed before the survey. Ten panel experts, including 6 ultrasound experts (3 of whom had administrative roles), 1 experienced medical quality manager, 1 researcher, 1 medical service department personnel and 1 policy-maker, were selected from the working committee of NUQCC for questionnaire development and they were independent from the hospitals enrolled. To propose the indicators, the panel experts were asked to propose the indicators based on current practice patterns, knowledge, and from structure, process, and result quality control levels. To modify the indicators, all 82 experts at the NUQCC and management specialists were encouraged to submit written opinions on adding, deleting or merging indicators. To determine the indicators, the aggregated results of written opinions were presented to the panel experts. Again, the panel experts were asked to evaluate the significance and feasibility of the recommendations and to determine the final indicators.</p><p id="para0017">All the detailed information on the website was structured into 22 indicators, including (1) general information of the hospitals, such as the hospital tier, hospitals ownership and category, hospital location, and quality inspection rate of ultrasonic instruments; (2) information about the departments&#x02019; sonologists, such as their age, ranking, and education; (3) workload of the department, such as the average sonologists per 10,000 patients per year; and (4) the use rate of BI-RADS templates and the accuracy rate of breast cancer ultrasound diagnosis in the department.</p></sec><sec id="sec0008"><title>Definitions of the survey indicators</title><p id="para0018">The ownership of hospitals in mainland China is divided into state-owned hospitals and private hospitals. Public hospitals are generally referred to as nonprofit hospitals run by the state, and private hospitals are referred to joint-stock hospitals run by individuals or partners, which are for-profit hospitals. Chinese hospitals in mainland China are classified into Tiers 1, 2, and 3. The standards of hospital grading mainly include hospital scale, management level and medical quality of the hospitals, such as diagnosis quality, treatment quality, and nursing quality.<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> The higher the tier, the better the hospital. There are also general hospitals and specialized hospitals. Specialized hospitals refer to hospitals that specialize in a certain disease, while general hospitals are hospitals that are engaged in multiple types of diseases. There are various specialties, such as internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, and paediatrics. Physician rankings in mainland China include chief, associate chief, attending and resident physicians, which are different from the rankings used in Europe and the United States.<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The upgrading of a physician's ranking is based on educational background, clinical hours, practice level, and academic achievement.</p><p id="para0019">The average number of sonologists per 10,000 patients refers to the number of sonologists required to complete each 10,000 ultrasound examinations in one year. The ultrasound instrument quality inspection rate was defined as the number of ultrasound instruments passing the quality inspections to the total number of ultrasound instruments in the ultrasound department during the same period. The quality inspection of the ultrasound instrument was carried out by the nationally recognized metrology and testing agency, and a qualified mark was issued.</p><p id="para0020">The BI-RADS utilization rate is defined as the proportion of ultrasound reports of breast lesions classified by ACR BI-RADS&#x000ae; Ultrasound 2013 to the total number of breast reports during the same period. Each participating hospital randomly selected no fewer than 100 breast ultrasound reports and calculated the utilization rate of BI-RADS templates.</p><p id="para0021">The breast cancer ultrasound diagnosis accuracy rate is defined as (true positive cases + true negative cases)/the total number of cases during the same period. No fewer than 100 cases diagnosed by breast ultrasound and confirmed by pathology were randomly selected from each participating hospital. True positives and true negatives refer to ACR BI-RADS&#x000ae; Ultrasound 2013.<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> True positives on breast cancer ultrasound are cases with a breast ultrasound diagnosis of BI-RADS Category 4/5 and biopsy or surgical excision with confirmed malignant pathology. True negatives of breast cancer ultrasound are cases with a breast ultrasound diagnosis of BI-RADS Category 1/2/3 and biopsy or surgical excision with confirmed benign pathology. The final pathologic results were considered the gold standard for diagnosis.</p><p id="para0022">According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the economic development level of the 31 provinces is measured by per capita gross domestic product (GDP). GDP per capita is divided into two categories: high and low. Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Fujian, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Tianjin, Chongqing, Hubei, Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Anhui, Hunan, Hainan, and Sichuan are regions with a high GDP. Those with low levels of economic development include Liaoning, Henan, Ningxia, Jiangxi, Xinjiang, Tibet, Yunnan, Qinghai, Guizhou, Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, and Gansu (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stats.gov.cn/" id="interref0001">http://www.stats.gov.cn/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="sec0009"><title>Investigative procedures</title><p id="para0023">Each hospital completed the real-name registration on the website. The survey was completed electronically on the website after approval. The interviewers were designated persons in the ultrasound departments (usually administrative secretaries). All interviewers were trained for one day prior to the survey to familiarize with the indicators and improve their investigative skills. The survey was conducted in face-to-face interviews with the respondents (chief or a designated person from the department). Data entry was uploaded synchronously by the interviewers. The rationality and logicality of each hospital's data were evaluated by data specialists. If unqualified results were found, the data was sent back to the department for re-survey and acquisition. Final data quality control was performed by the survey committee.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="para0024">Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and were analysed using the chi-squared test. Quantitative data are expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). For continuous data, an unpaired t test was used to assess the differences between the two groups. Based on the parameter estimates from the statistically significant results of the t tests, a multivariate logistic regression model was established to evaluate the correlations between the factors and breast cancer ultrasound diagnostic accuracy rate. We used a linear mixed model to estimate the BI-RADS utilization rate. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 19.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Differences at P&#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec0011"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p id="para0025">The funders played no role in the study design, collection or analysis of data, interpretation of results, or writing of the report.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0012"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec0013"><title>Departments providing ultrasound diagnosis in mainland China</title><p id="para0026">A total of 5,460 departments providing ultrasound diagnoses in mainland China were enrolled.

This was the first nationwide breast ultrasound study conducted by an official national organization and supported by local governments and health committees in mainland China.</p><p id="para0033">Breast cancer remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Ultrasound is a cost-effective screening modality; however, it depends on the operators for mass assessment. Breast imaging structured reporting templates were encouraged for reporting breast ultrasound examination results. The ACR BI-RADS lexicon helped standardize image descriptions and interpretation reports.<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The average utilization rate of BI-RADS in mainland China was 87%, which is still unsatisfactory. This finding suggests that the importance of using BI-RADS was not fully recognized by sonologists in Chinese hospitals. Our study found that the high GDP per capita of the province, hospital characteristics, including specialized and Tier 3 hospitals, a high proportion of doctors with master's and doctoral degrees and doctors &#x02264;35 years had a positive correlation with the BI-RADS utilization rate. Doctors &#x02264;35 years old may have received breast ultrasound training since the beginning of standardized training for national residents in 2015, and the use of BI-RADS is higher. Our data show that well-trained and educated sonologists were concentrated in Tier 3 hospitals, which may lead to higher rates of BI-RADS use.</p><p id="para0034">Previous studies showed that the accuracy of breast ultrasound is as high as 69&#x02013;93%.<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> We showed that ultrasound performed well in differentiating breast nodules with an accuracy rate of 74%, which was comparable to reported data. With the unbalanced economic development in various regions of the country, our research results also found that the per capita GDP of a province is a significant positive factor for the accuracy of breast cancer diagnosis. Previous studies also demonstrated that ultrasound diagnostic sensitivity and specificity are higher in high-income countries than in low- and middle-income countries.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> A meta-analysis study, including articles from 2000 to 2018, showed that ultrasound had an overall sensitivity and specificity of 80.1% and 88.4%, respectively. When only data from low- and middle-income country were considered, the sensitivity of ultrasound diagnosis was 75% and the specificity was 69%.<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Although breast cancer incidence is low in low-income countries, mortality rates are high in these regions as a result of defects in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Economic barriers to accurate detection and diagnosis need to be addressed.<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p id="para0035">We observed positive associations between the BI-RADS utilization rate and breast cancer ultrasound diagnostic accuracy.

The number of sonologists per hospital and the workload of each sonologist were higher in Tier 3 hospitals. Moreover, the workload of doctors in regions with a higher GDP per capita was greater than that in regions with a higher GDP per capita. The workload of sonologists in mainland China was not comparable to the data from some countries, such as the United States, because a sonologist in mainland China performs both ultrasounds and are engaged in ultrasound diagnosis and treatment. Some countries, such as Italy and South Korea, have similar practices. In Italy, 1423 examinations (including CT, ultrasound, MRI, etc.) for each employee in the radiology department were performed, whereas the work-charge for each technologist resulted in approximately 2800 diagnostic imaging examinations.<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> There were on average 2.25 sonologists per 10,000 patients in mainland China. Thua, the average annual workload per sonologist was 4444 procedures.</p><p id="para0037">A typical sonologist in mainland China is a 25- to 35-year-old fellow with a bachelor's degree. Our data found that different tiers of hospitals have different compositions of sonologists, and more high-level and highly educated sonologists are concentrated in Tier 3 hospitals. The results also showed that the proportion of Tier 3 hospitals was related to the level of economic development in the region.</p><p id="para0038">There are several limitations to our study. First, although quality control was implemented, the survey was completed by interviewers on the website, which may affect the accuracy of the information. Some hospitals' ultrasound information systems are not compatible with the survey, which may lead to data reporting errors. Equivalently sampled hospitals in the analysis might be misleading for some national (or province-level) statistics. The authenticity and reliability of some data need to be improved. The direct capture of quality control data from various medical institutions will be a key focus in the future. Second, all included hospitals were Tier 3 and Tier 2 hospitals instead of community hospitals, which may have led to selection bias. Third, interobserver variation in BI-RADS categories among different sonologists exists.</p></sec><sec id="sec0018"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="para0039">The use of the BI-RADS template effectively improved the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound. Moreover, this survey summarized the current situation of departments and sonologists providing breast ultrasound diagnosis in mainland China, and discovered the factors affecting the utilization rate of the BI-RADS template and the accuracy of breast cancer ultrasound diagnosis. These findings can help monitor the development of the discipline and provide information for administrators to meet growing demand.</p></sec><sec id="sec0019"><title>Contributors</title><p id="para0040">W-HY and J-YX conceived of and designed the study.

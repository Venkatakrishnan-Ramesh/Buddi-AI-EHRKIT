</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Chronic heart failure (CHF) leads to considerable morbidity, mortality, and health care resource consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Frequent re-hospitalizations due to worsening heart failure (HF) are an important driver of health care costs in this condition. An estimated 1&#x02013;2% of the population of industrialized countries suffer from CHF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A recent systematic review of cost-of-illness studies showed that HF poses a considerable and growing economic burden on health care systems with total annual costs estimated at USD25,532 in Germany (approx. equivalent to &#x020ac;23,992 or Swiss Francs (SFr)&#x000a0;24 on 3 May, 2022) and lifetime costs at USD126,819 (approx. &#x020ac;119,776 or SFr123,154) per patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Costs rise as patients&#x02019; severity of disease worsens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Approximately one in two patients with CHF has iron deficiency (ID), which is associated with increased mortality, increased hospitalization rate, reduced exercise capacity, and reduced quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that intravenous iron substitution with ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) can reduce symptoms and HF-associated hospitalizations and improve QoL and exercise capacity in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, the European Society of Cardiology 2016 guidelines on acute and chronic HF recommended screening for ID in HFrEF patients, and if present, to consider FCM treatment (class IIa indication) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Studies on the cost effectiveness and budget impact of treating HFrEF patients with ID with FCM were carried out in several European countries with divergent results, some showing additional costs and some showing costs savings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The impact of treating HFrEF patients with ID with FCM on health care costs in Switzerland is still unclear. Hence, this study sought to explore the impact of intravenous FCM therapy versus placebo in HFrEF patients presenting with ID with or without anemia (ID/IDA) on health care costs in Switzerland using Swiss data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="Par9">ISPOR&#x02019;s good practice guide for budget impact analysis was used as a basis for conducting and reporting the present analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Model Structure</title><p id="Par10">The perspective of the analysis was that of the Swiss mandatory health insurance system. The budget impact associated with treating HFrEF patients with ID in Switzerland with FCM versus placebo was assessed based on a model originally developed for Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. HFrEF was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction &#x0003c;&#x02009;45%. ID was defined as serum ferritin level &#x0003c;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;ng/mL, or between 100 and 300&#x000a0;ng/mL if transferrin saturation (TSAT) was &#x0003c;&#x02009;20%. The model used clinical trial data to predict New York Heart Association (NYHA) class changes over time, rates of hospitalizations due to worsening HF, and average length of hospital stay for NYHA classes I&#x02013;IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Due to a lack of available data for Switzerland, model results presented here are only based on changes in hospitalization costs and FCM drug costs due to the changes in NYHA class over time due to FCM treatment, without taking into consideration any cost differences which might be due to changes in average length of hospital stay. Placebo is the relevant comparator for Switzerland, as registry data showed that iron status was only determined in 62% of patients participating in a heart failure registry focusing on iron deficiency, only 8.5% of iron-deficient HF patients were treated with iron therapy, and only 2.6% were treated with intravenous iron therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The use of oral iron supplementation in this patient population was further not recommended by Swiss practitioners as the dose typically required to achieve iron repletion in this patient population would require treatment with oral iron over a period of &#x0003e;&#x02009;6 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The timeframe of the budget impact model was 1&#x000a0;year. The cost year of the base case was 2015 in line with a specially commissioned data analysis described in the following section. Updated unit costs for 2019/2020 were used as part of sensitivity analyses.</p><p id="Par12">In line with available efficacy data from clinical trials, all patients were in NYHA classes II and III at the start of the model. Patients were able to stay in the same NYHA class they were in at the start of the model or move to any of NYHA classes I&#x02013;IV during the course of 1 year as observed in the relevant clinical trials.</p><p id="Par13">At baseline, the average age of the pooled trial dataset was 68.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 10.1). Males comprised 50.9% of the patients. The mean hemoglobin of the pooled trial dataset was 12.1&#x000a0;g/dL (SD 1.3) with 67.1% classified as NYHA class III and 32.9% as NYHA class II. As the distribution of NYHA classes in the eligible Swiss population was considered to differ from that of the pooled trial dataset based on clinical expert opinion, this was changed for the Swiss model adaptation.</p><p id="Par14">Clinical expert opinion was sought from three medical specialists working in a range of hospital settings and different language regions of Switzerland, covering a large university hospital and two medium-sized regional hospitals in the German and Italian-speaking regions. Input values for the base-case and sensitivity analyses were decided by consensus. The same three medical specialists were consulted for all aspects of clinical expert opinion described in the Methods section and co-authored this manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Epidemiology and Cost Inputs</title><p id="Par15">A structured literature review was carried out to identify sources of published data to populate the budget impact model with cost and epidemiological data specific to Switzerland. This is described in detail in the Online Appendix (see electronic supplementary material [ESM]). The searches did not identify any publicly available data suitable to populate the budget impact model with Swiss epidemiological or cost data. Publicly available cost data were not suitable for use in the Swiss budget impact model as they did not reflect causality (i.e. costs being incurred &#x0201c;due to worsening of CHF&#x0201d;) and did not allow hospitalization costs to be distinguished by NYHA class. Publicly available epidemiological data were not specific to Switzerland but reflected pooled data from both Germany and Switzerland.</p><p id="Par16">As a result, an analysis of SwissDRG data was specifically commissioned to obtain cost data suitable for use in the Swiss budget impact model, supplemented by expert advice from a diagnosis-related groups (DRG) coding specialist (cs healthcare consult). In addition, Swiss clinical expert opinion was sought regarding epidemiology, cost, and Swiss treatment patterns (e.g. whether patients would be treated at university hospitals or non-university hospitals and which treatments patients in a specific NYHA class might typically receive).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Base-Case Model Inputs</title><p id="Par17">Base case model input parameters and associated values are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Base-case model input parameter values</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Model parameter</th><th align="left">Value (base case)</th><th align="left">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Hospitalization cost, per case, NYHA I</td><td align="left">SFr&#x000a0;15,444</td><td align="left">Specially commissioned analysis of SwissDRG data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hospitalization cost, per case, NYHA II</td><td align="left">SFr&#x000a0;15,519</td><td align="left">Specially commissioned analysis of SwissDRG data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hospitalization cost, per case, NYHA III</td><td align="left">SFr&#x000a0;13,951</td><td align="left">Specially commissioned analysis of SwissDRG data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hospitalization cost, per case, NYHA IV</td><td align="left">SFr&#x000a0;12,263</td><td align="left">Specially commissioned analysis of SwissDRG data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Number of eligible heart failure patients per year</td><td align="left">46,375 patients</td><td align="left">Derived from published sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Swiss clinical expert opinion based on EVITA-RAID register</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Proportion of heart failure patients with NYHA class II</td><td align="left">35%</td><td align="left">Swiss clinical expert opinion based on the international literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">FCM drug costs for 500&#x000a0;mg (10&#x000a0;mL)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">SFr&#x000a0;164.29</td><td align="left">Published price in positive list of reimbursed drugs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xn--spezialittenliste-yqb.ch/">http://www.xn--spezialittenliste-yqb.ch/</ext-link>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">FCM drug costs for 1000&#x000a0;mg (20&#x000a0;mL)<sup>a</sup></td><td align="left">SFr&#x000a0;338.40</td><td align="left">Published price in positive list of reimbursed drugs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xn--spezialittenliste-yqb.ch/">http://www.xn--spezialittenliste-yqb.ch/</ext-link>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Probability to be in specific NYHA class I&#x02013;IV or death over time</td><td align="left">See Online Appendix Table S4 in the ESM</td><td align="left">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Rate of hospitalization due to worsening of CHF</td><td align="left"><p>Placebo 0.0026 per patient-week</p><p>FCM 0.0010 per patient-week</p></td><td align="left">[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>CHF</italic> chronic heart failure, <italic>ESM</italic> electronic supplementary material, <italic>FCM</italic> ferric carboxymaltose, <italic>NYHA</italic> New York Heart Association functional class, <italic>SFr</italic> Swiss Francs</p><p><sup>a</sup>Calculated on basis of the most economical package size</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Number of Eligible Heart Failure Patients</title><p id="Par18">The overall number of HF patients in Switzerland was estimated based on a prevalence of 175,000 per year (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

of treating HFrEF patients with iron deficiency (ID) with FCM in Switzerland. Treatment with FCM in this patient population was estimated to result in net cost savings.</p><p id="Par40">A budget impact model for France demonstrated net cost savings with FCM treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In contrast, a budget impact model for Germany showed that FCM treatment was associated with a small additional cost of &#x020ac;40 per patient from the perspective of the statutory health insurance system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The reason for this difference in results between Germany and Switzerland might have been due to relatively larger differences in hospitalization costs compared with differences in FCM drug costs between the two countries. Cost-effectiveness analyses performed for the UK and Spain showed FCM treatment to be cost effective given usual willingness-to-pay thresholds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This means that FCM treatment in HFrEF patients with ID in Spain and the UK was associated with additional costs, as well as increased efficacy. In contrast, a cost-effectiveness analysis performed for the Nordic countries showed that FCM treatment was associated not only with increased efficacy but also with cost savings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p id="Par41">The current study has several limitations which are mainly related to the scarce availability of data for Switzerland. Indeed, a systematic review did not result in identifying suitable Swiss data to populate the model. Despite the existence of disease registries in Switzerland, none was able to furnish relevant data specific enough to the patient population covered in this budget impact analysis, nor did disease registry data include costs in different sectors of the health care system. The model base case was thus populated with data relating to the inpatient sector only. We explored the inclusion of outpatient costs in one sensitivity analysis based on Swiss clinical expert opinion.</p><p id="Par42">One limitation of the current study is that it does not explicitly take into account FCM administration costs due to the focus on inpatient costs. If FCM were administered in the outpatient sector in line with guideline recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], administration costs for iron doses up to 1000&#x000a0;mg would be estimated at approximately SFr&#x000a0;51 (approx. &#x020ac;49) (Tarmed tariff position no. 00.1430&#x02014;15-min intravenous injection or infusion administered by nurse, associated with 57.09 tax points valued at an average of SFr&#x000a0;0.89 per tax point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). Adverse event costs were not included in the model as serious adverse events are exceedingly rare and the most common adverse events like nausea and minor injection- or infusion-site reactions are self-limiting and would not incur treatment costs in routine clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The model was further populated with data obtained from HF patients overall, including patients with and without ID because of a lack of data for the specific patient group of interest, namely HF patients with ID. The reason for this appeared to be that treating physicians either did not diagnose and/or code ID despite the literature showing that this condition is present in a sizeable proportion of HF patients and is associated with worse prognosis (quality of life, re-hospitalization) and increased costs in comparison with HF patients without ID. This is in line with the findings of the analysis of registry data described in the Methods section reporting that iron status was only determined in 62% of heart failure patients treated in centers participating in a registry focusing on ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A separate analysis of the data of a single Swiss university hospital used for one of the sensitivity analyses showed that HF cases with ID coding were more expensive on average for NYHA classes II&#x02013;IV than HF cases without additional ID coding. However, this was based on very small patient numbers. There were no data available to compare costs for NYHA class I. To account for these limitations, parameter values to populate the budget impact model were chosen conservatively in order to bias against FCM, to avoid overestimating the cost savings associated with FCM treatment (e.g. estimating costs based on a patient without any complications, rather than on a far more costly patient with complications).</p><p id="Par44">There was also uncertainty regarding the number of eligible HFrEF patients. Based on pooled Swiss and German registry data, 54.7% of HFrEF patients were estimated to also have ID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], with expert opinion suggesting that 53% of Swiss HFrEF patients also have ID. International prevalence rates were found to range widely from 37 to &#x0003e;&#x02009;70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Using alternative international data to estimate the prevalence of ID in HFrEF patients resulted in a broadly similar estimate to the Swiss base case estimate of 53% overall, with estimates of ID with or without anemia ranging from 53% in NYHA class I or II patients to 48% in NYHA class III or IV patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To account for the uncertainty inherent in this estimate, as well as a lack of robust data regarding uptake of FCM in this patient population, the budget impact model was also run for just one patient (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1), rather than for the whole HFrEF patient population with ID potentially eligible for FCM treatment in Switzerland.</p><p id="Par45">A further limitation of this study, again relating to the availability of data, is that the clinical efficacy model underlying the budget impact model was based on clinical trials including stable HF patients, whereas the cost data available related only to acute HF patients.</p><p id="Par46">The uncertainty relating to the cost differential between NYHA classes II and III, which may be difficult to discern in clinical practice, was explored in a sensitivity analysis as well. In the course of exploring this, we came across an interesting observation relating to the comparison of costs and hence model results across countries.</p><p id="Par47">The data analysis conducted to identify Swiss hospitalization costs associated with different NYHA classes showed a cost gradient, with NYHA class IV being associated with lower hospitalization costs than NYHA class III. This appears counterintuitive in that one would expect the inpatient treatment of patients with higher disease severity (and therefore higher NYHA functional class) to cost more than that of patients with a lower disease severity, in line with the pattern of hospitalization costs observed in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. One explanation for the observed counterintuitive cost gradient in the Swiss data might be the very small number of cases identified in the data pool of patients with NYHA class I receiving inpatient hospital treatment (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17). It has further been suggested by a medical controlling expert (cs healthcare consult) that the counterintuitive gradient with NYHA class IV patients treated in Switzerland incurring lower average hospitalization costs than NYHA class III patients, which was not observed in Germany, might be due to systematic differences in the way patients are assigned DRG codes within the German and the Swiss DRG systems. In Switzerland, patients are assigned a specific DRG code independently of the NYHA class coded as the main diagnosis. Hence, secondary diagnoses, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures which may not all be a direct consequence of heart failure may determine which DRG code is assigned to an individual patient. In contrast, in Germany, patients are usually assigned a specific DRG code depending on the severity of HF, that is, based on NYHA class. This example of HF hospitalization costs thus illustrates the pitfalls of assuming that results from even such a simple economic model as a budget impact analysis can be transferred directly to countries with seemingly similar health care and reimbursement systems.</p><p id="Par48">The strengths of our analysis are that the budget impact model probably underestimated the effect of FCM treatment on overall costs. The main reason for this was that the base case considered only the effect on costs of overall differences in the rate of hospitalization observed with FCM. Differences in length of stay which were also observed with FCM in the randomized clinical trials were not considered in this analysis due to the lack of suitable Swiss data to represent this in the budget impact model. While a budget impact model may represent a relatively simple form of economic comparison from a methodological point of view, the message it conveys is easy to understand and familiar to Swiss decision makers as budget impact is widely used in the Swiss health care system. This analysis adds to existing knowledge by being the first exploration of the rate and cost of potentially avoidable hospitalizations with FCM treatment in HFrEF patients with ID in Switzerland. It further adds to existing knowledge by being the first analysis of the budget impact of FCM treatment in CHF patients with ID in Switzerland. In addition, it is based on a specifically commissioned data analysis of secondary data in an area with a paucity of published data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par49">Intravenous iron substitution is easy to administer and incorporate in clinical practice.

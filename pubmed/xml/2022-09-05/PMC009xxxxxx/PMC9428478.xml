orthopedic challenges of all musculoskeletal injuries in
horses. Among them, superficial digital flexor tendon
(SDFT) injuries commonly occur in racehorses, which is
associated with considerable time and cost (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Tendon is
a hypo-vascular and hypo-cellular tissue naturally leading
to a low metabolic activity rate which, in turn, slows
down spontaneous tendon repair. Autonomous tendon
regeneration is accompanied by abnormalities, not only
in cellular phenotypes but also in extracellular matrix
(ECM) composition. These abnormalities may result in
scar formation and ectopic calcification, leading to elastic
mismatch and mechanical complications followed by
tendon rupture (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Conventional medical interventions are mainly intended to control pain or destroy damaged
tissue that results in loss of functionality. In recent years, cell therapy strategies using
stem or progenitor cells have received a great deal of attention to improve the efficiency
of tendon regeneration, particularly in horses (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). However, the relatively high risk of
ectopic bone formation, and potential migration of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) from the site of transplantation, suggests that <italic>in vitro</italic> tenogenic
induction before transplantation can improve the healing process and avoid the risks
mentioned above (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) have attracted a great
deal of attention for cell-based regeneration strategies because of their abundance and easy
accessibility and their ability to secrete both tendon ECM components and cytokines (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).
Indeed, different growth factors [such as TGFB, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and
insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF1)] have been applied extensively to overcome challenges of
routine cell therapy strategies (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has become a popular
approach in cell-based therapies, both in humans and animals, because of its exceptional
level of growth factors (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence support the pivotal regulatory
role of transforming growth factor B (TGFB) superfamily
either during the development of musculoskeletal
differentiation or tissue repair via TGFB and/or bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMP) signaling pathways.
Three well-known ligand isoforms of the TGFB family
(TGFB1, TGFB2, and TGFB3) affect cellular activities
via canonical (SMADs 2/3-dependent) or non-canonical
pathways (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The precise regulation of these alternative
pathways is highly dependent on cell type, culture
conditions, and possible cross-talk with other signaling
pathways, which in turn control the overall performance
of stem cells (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>TGFB is a pivotal factor for tendon generation in such
a way that mutation in either the ligands (TGFB2 and
TGFB3) or the receptor (TBR2) prevents tenogenesis
during the early stages of embryogenesis (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). During
natural tendon healing, TGFB1 normally reaches the
peak of expression earlier, while TGFB3 is expressed
through the late stages (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Given the importance of
the TGFB family in tendon development and repair,
most of the applied regenerative approaches trigger the
TGFB signaling pathway as the critical regulator of
musculoskeletal lineage (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). All three known isoforms of
TGFB revealed a positive effect on viability and cologne
synthesis during tendon healing (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Furthermore, it is
evident that TGFB1 causes scar tissue formation, whereas
TGFB3 reduces its creation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).
</p><p>Although TGFB has many important roles in tendon development and differentiation, it also
regulates chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation in which the balance between TGFB and
BMP signaling is important (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In general, BMP signaling restricts SCX expression as the
key trigger signal for tenogenic differentiation. Phosphorylation of BMP receptors activates
intracellular downstream SMADs (SMADs 1/5/8) that form a stable complex associated with
SMAD4, which then translocate into the nucleus and regulate several target genes such as
runt-related transcription factor 2 (<italic>RUNX2</italic>). BMP signaling plays a crucial
role in bone formation, and the knockdown of its receptor (<italic>BMPR2</italic>) inhibits
osteogenesis in MSCs (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The positive impact of some BMP family members (BMP11, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, and
13) on tendon differentiation is also reported (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). </p><p><italic>BMP</italic> antagonizing appears to increase <italic>SCX </italic>expression,
accompanied by reduced calcification (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Among various BMP antagonists, gremlin-2 (GREM2)
presents the notable potential to bind and inhibit BMP-2 and BMP-4 efficiently and block the
activation of Smad1/5/8. Furthermore, sclerostin (SOST) is also a BMP antagonist with a
higher binding affinity to BMP 5/6/7 than BMP2/4 (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). However, SOST is not accepted as a
classical BMP inhibitor but more propounded as an antagonistic ligand for Wnt coreceptor
LDL-receptor-related protein5 and 6 (LRP5 and LRP6). Indeed, SOST can effectively promote
catenin beta1 destruction and down-regulation of the canonical Wnt target genes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Wnt
signaling pathway provides effective crosstalk with the BMPs and is involved in bone
formation and homeostasis. It has also been reported that canonical Wnt mediators are
overexpressed along with tendinopathy injuries (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). </p><p>Besides chemical stimulation, scaffolds also provide a
promising strategy for regulating various cellular behaviors,
such as survival, proliferation, and differentiation
(<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). There are two common members of the poly
(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs): Poly (3-hydroxybutyrate)
(PHB) and its copolymer with 3-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV).
They are known as biological polyesters produced by
microorganisms and used as the intracellular energy
source. So far, PHB/PHBV nanofibrous membranes
have been widely investigated to regenerate connective
tissues (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). In fact, PHB /PHBV nanofibrous scaffolds
attract significant attention to tendon tissue engineering
due to their adaptable mechanical properties, long-term
biodegradation, and relatively similar structure to tendon
ECM (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). It has also been reported that incorporating
collagen into nanofibrous scaffolds effectively improves
the biological responses involved in tenogenesis (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).
</p><p>Our recent data demonstrated that eq-ASCs had
propounded inherent potential to differentiate towards
musculoskeletal lineage amplified in response to TGFB3
treatment (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Regarding the critical role of TGFB during
the tendon development and repair, we investigated how
inhibition of the BMP signaling pathway along with
TGFB activation can modulate the exclusive tenogenic
differentiation of eq-ASCs with the elimination of
undesirable osteo-chondrogenesis. This goal was
followed through the stepwise treatment of eq-ASCs
by TGFB3 and a combination of GREM2 and SOST.
Furthermore, we investigated the impact of PHB /PHBV/
COL1 nanofibrous scaffold on improving the tenogenic
differentiation status of eq-ASCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Eq-ASCs isolation, Culture, and Characterization </title><p>Subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were obtained from a 2-years-old female horse, and

conducted concerning related reports on the different types of MSCs (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Following

regenerating functional tendons are often inefficient. Therefore, <italic>in vitro</italic>
modification for improving the efficacy of cell therapy appears to be highly reasonable
before clinical application. We recently showed that eq-ASCs have inherent differentiation
capacity to musculoskeletallineage (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In the present study, we focused on investigating
an efficient procedure for specific tenogenic induction of eq-ASCs with particular attention
to reducing the chance of osteogenesis.</p><p>During embryogenesis, transcription factors, such as scleraxis (SCX) and sex-determining
region Y-box 9 (SOX9), play a crucial role in the formation of tendon progenitors, whereas
Mohawk (MKX) and early growth response protein 1/2 (EGR1/2) are required for terminal tendon
differentiation. These transcription factors are involved in tenocyte specification and
coding ECM components such as collagen type I (<italic>COL1A1</italic>) and tenomodulin
(<italic>TNMD</italic>) as a late marker of tendon development (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Therefore, we
initially estimate the effective concentration of TGFB3 that induced higher expression of
<italic>SCX</italic>. Since the highest expression level of <italic>SCX</italic> was
achieved on day 1, for further experiments, we treated the cells with TGFB3 only for one
day. </p><p>Literature supports the critical impact of TGFB3 ligands on the up-regulation of
tendon-associated markers, including <italic>MKX</italic> and <italic>COL1</italic>, via
up-regulation of SCX (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The relative expression of these markers was decreased upon the
continuation of treatment with TGFB3 within the following days. This is not unexpected as
the expression of SCX was reduced by further treatment with TGFB3 (after day one). Indeed,
similar to our results, it has been shown that a high concentration of TGFB over time
negatively affects tenogenesis (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Therefore, we decided to treat the eq-ASCs only with
TGFB3 for one day based on these results.</p><p>These results confirmed that TGFB3 efficiently triggered tendon specification of eq-ASCs
while achieving a stable and final tenogenic differentiation status requires complementary
signals. It is important to note that ectopic mineralization, as a major hurdle to tendon
regeneration, takes place in the absence of these secondary signals. Besides, BMP treatment
has an inhibitory effect on <italic>SCX</italic> expression, which was almost reversed by
noggin (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Hence, we focused on inhibiting the BMP signaling pathway by using two
well-known BMP antagonists, GREM2 and SOST, following one-day treatment or induction with
TGFB3. </p><p>Initially, we showed that short-term treatment with
GREM2 for one day and assessment of SCX on day 3
did not improve SCX expression compared to the control
group. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the effect of
TGFB3 for one day, followed by GREM2 from days
2-10. Our result revealed that the expression of SCX,
MKX, and COL1A1 was increased on day 3, followed
by a reduction during additional days. The only signal in
osteo-chondrogenic differentiation was reduced through
treatment with TGFB3 followed by GREM2 was RUNX2.
Therefore, these results suggest that other secondary
signals are required to improve tenogenic differentiation. </p><p>Several lines of evidence verified SOST as an impressive BMP antagonist, which also
negatively regulates the Wnt signaling pathway and inhibits osteogenesis (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Therefore, it
was not surprising that the severe inhibition of BMPR2 induced by GREM2 was partially
reversed in the presence of SOST, which seemed to recover the BMP pathway to some extent.
This is consistent with the observed drastic down-regulation of <italic>RUNX2</italic> by
the combinational treatment with G/S over time (day 10), along with the reduced
<italic>CTNNB</italic> level. Although SOX9 is known as a cartilage-associated marker,
previous studies have suggested that a basal level of <italic>SOX9</italic> expression is
required in a distinct subtype of tendon progenitor cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We also found a primary
overexpression of <italic>SOX9</italic> in T/G and T/G/S groups, which declined over
time.</p><p>Regarding tenogenic related genes, T/G treated cells
showed the highest expression level of SCX, while MKX
showed its highest expression in T/G/S group, both on
day 3. Considering the primary high COL1A1 expression
level in untreared cells, T/G/S showed aoitential to keep
this level constant which underscored the importance of
SOST in tenogenic induction. These results are consistent
with the data obtained by Sirius Red staining showing
almost the same manner for the secretion of collagen
fibers as the major extracellular content in the tendon.</p><p>SCX is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that plays a critical role in the
early stage of development in tenocytes and other dense connective tissues, like periodontal
ligaments and heart valve (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Regarding the force transmitting function of these cells,
SCX is required for modulating cytoskeletal tension via triggering the expression of
proteins linked between actin filaments and integrin molecules (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Nichols et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>)
reported that equine tenocytes transfected with <italic>SCX</italic> siRNA faced a
remarkable decrease in cytoskeletal stiffness and inability to migrate on soft surfaces.
Moreover, several tendonspecific genes, such as <italic>MKX, COL1</italic>, and
<italic>TNMD</italic>, are positively regulated in tenocytes by SCX (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>Unlike SCX, different studies have noticed some severe issues with using TNMD as a reliable
marker for tenogenic differentiation in equines, especially at mRNA level. For instance, an
almost similar expression level of <italic>TNMD</italic> was detected by Taylor et al. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)
in the &#x02018;horse&#x02019;s bone and tendon. Also, Barsby and Guest (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) provided some valuable evidence
about the high degradation of TNMD mRNA in TGFB -treated equine ESCs. Similarly, we also did
not find TNMD expression in the control and tested groups.</p><p>Gene expression analysis was further confirmed at the
protein level, which revealed a more stable expression of
SCX and facilitated the expression of MKX as the result
of T/G/S treatment compared to T/G treatment. Since the
morphological feature of cells is still noted as an important
sign of their state, the spindle-like shape and aligned
arrangement are typically considered for tenocytes, in
contrast with the more rounded shape of tenoblasts with a
large and oval nucleus. At the end of the induction time,
we observed spindle-like cells with elongated nuclei and
thin cytoplasmic protrusions.</p><p>Overall, based on the results of gene expression
analysis, protein expression data, and morphological
analysis, we propose a stepwise protocol to induce
tenogenic differentiation of eq-ASCs within 7 days which
is far shorter than what has been previously reported (14
days) by transient induction with TGFB3 followed by coinhibition of BMP and Wnt signaling pathways. In addition,
one of the main strengths of this procedure was a severe
reduction in levels of ectopic osteo and chondrogenesis
markers. It has been highlighted in several studies in which
the expression of tendon-associated markers were shown
to be down-regulated in mature tenocytes (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). However,
reaching stable mature tenocytes with proper function in
the long term and preventing cellular dedifferentiation
requires further modification of the protocol. Therefore,
we subsequently examined the effects of nanofibrous
PHB /PHBV/COL1 scaffolds on the efficiency and longterm stability of reported sequential tenogenic induction
on eq-ASCs.
</p><p>Both enhanced and more stable expression of tenogenic
markers and the potent inhibition of osteo-chondrogenesis
on PHB /PHBV/COL1 membrane proposed the scaffold
as a suitable substrate for cell transplantation and tendon
regeneration. It seems that incorporating collagen type 1,
as the major content of natural tendon ECM, in addition to
the fibrous and porous topology of PHB/PHBV, provides
a positive impact on tenogenesis (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). </p><p>It is interesting to note that the most successful cell
therapy approaches were reported in the cases of intralesional injection of a cell suspension due to granular
tissue and the enclosed nature of core lesions. The
use of MSC-derived tenocyte progenitors revealed
a notable positive impact on increasing the efficacy
of cell therapy for tendon repair (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Although, for
other forms of tendon-related disorders (like eccentric
lesions), further studies are required to optimize
the condition ,including the use of different types of
scaffolds or self-organizing tendon structures (3D
tendon-like tissue constructs).</p><p>For the first time, we investigated the tenogenic
differentiation of equine adipose stem cells under the
stepwise inductive approach which provides a safe,
valuable alternative for un-induced MSCs for future
intra-lesional injection. This result was verified mainly
by using the scaffold to maintain a tenogenic status.
However, future studies need to be conducted regarding
the damaged condition to choose a scaffold which can be
practicaly delivered into equine tendon injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrated a fast and effective
procedure for reducing the risk of ectopic osteogenesis
in tendon regeneration strategies. We recently provided
evidence that confirmed the remarkable potential of
eq-ASCs for spontaneous differentiation towards

endogenous TGFB1. Here, we established a stepwise

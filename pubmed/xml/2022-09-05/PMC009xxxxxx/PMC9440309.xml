We developed new <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging strategies to combine EGFP expression in microglia with neuronal expression of genetically encoded ratiometric redox sensors (rogRFP2 or roGFP1), and immunohistochemistry to investigate how microglia influence Ox-stress at amyloid plaques in 5xFAD AD mice. By simultaneously imaging microglia morphology and neuronal Ox-stress over time <italic>in vivo</italic> and in fixed brains we found that microglia preferentially enwrapped DNs exhibiting the greatest degree of Ox-stress. After microglia were partially depleted with the CSF1 receptor antagonist PLX3397, Ox-stress in DNs increased in a manner that was inversely correlated to the extent of coverage of the adjacent A&#x003b2; plaques by the remaining microglia. These data suggest that microglia do not create Ox-stress at A&#x003b2; plaques but instead create protective barriers around A&#x003b2; plaques possibly reducing the spread of A&#x003b2;. Intracranial injection of A&#x003b2; was sufficient to induce neuronal Ox-stress suggesting it to be the initial trigger of Ox-stress generation. Although Ox-stress is increased in DNs, neuronal survival is enhanced following microglia depletion indicating complex and multifactorial roles of microglia with both neurotoxic and neuroprotective components. Increased Ox-stress of DNs was correlated with higher LAMP1 and ubiquitin immunoreactivity supporting proposed mechanistic links between lysosomal accumulation in DNs and their intrinsic generation of Ox-stress. Our results suggest protective as well as neurotoxic roles for microglia at plaques and that the generation of Ox-stress of DNs could intrinsically be generated via lysosomal disruption rather than by microglia.</p><p>In Brief: Simultaneous imaging of microglia and neuronal Ox-stress revealed a double-edged role for microglia in 5xFAD mice. Plaque associated microglia were attracted to and enwrapped A&#x003b2; plaques as well as the most highly oxidized DNs. After partial depletion of microglia, DNs were larger with greater levels of Ox-stress. Despite increased Ox-stress after microglia removal neuronal survival improved. Greater Ox-stress was correlated with increased levels of LAMP1 and ubiquitin thereby linking lysosome accumulation and Ox-stress in DNs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Microglia preferentially contact severely oxidized DNs.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Neuronal redox states observed using roGFP1 <italic>in vivo</italic> are preserved in PFA fixed brains allowing for secondary immunostainings.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Intracranial A&#x003b2; injection leads to the accumulation of insoluble A&#x003b2; aggregates which induced localized neuronal Ox-stress.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030">Ox-stress correlates with increased LAMP1 expressions indicating a correlation of Ox-stress and lysosome accumulation.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0035"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0035">Depletion of microglia reduces neuronal death while exacerbating Ox-stress and LAMP1 levels.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Microglia</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>Neurodegeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="pc_kYQVyqYgIpX8iCsWLTp4tjUeCEBVoDbA"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>AD, Alzheimer's Disease</kwd><kwd>A&#x003b2;, Amyloid beta</kwd><kwd>BACE1, Beta-secretase 1</kwd><kwd>DNs, Dystrophic neurites</kwd><kwd>GFAP, Glial fibrillary acidic protein</kwd><kwd>hSyn, human synapsin 1</kwd><kwd>IHC, Immunohistochemical</kwd><kwd>LAMP1, Lysosomal membrane protein 1</kwd><kwd>MAP2, Microtubule-associated protein 2</kwd><kwd>MPO, Myeloperoxidase</kwd><kwd>NEM, N-ethylmaleimide</kwd><kwd>NOX2, NADPH oxidase 2</kwd><kwd>Ox-stress, Oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>PFA, Paraformaldehyde</kwd><kwd>PLX, PLX3397</kwd><kwd>ROI, Region of interest</kwd><kwd>STED, Stimulated emission depletion</kwd><kwd>TREM2, Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0045">Oxidative stress (Ox-stress) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (AD) [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>]. For example, post-mortem brain studies showed that markers of Ox-stress were significantly increased in brains from AD patients with dementia, but not in healthy controls nor in non-demented patients with amyloid neuropathology, indicating that Ox-stress is closely correlated with symptomatic AD [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In previous studies using the genetically encoded redox indicator, roGFP1, the most intense Ox-stress in the brain was observed in the cellular elements termed dystrophic neurites (DNs) that cluster at amyloid beta (A&#x003b2;) plaques [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Long-term <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging also showed that Ox-stress in DNs at A&#x003b2; plaques preceded subsequent neuronal death [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. DNs, first described by Oskar Fischer in 1907 [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] are swollen cellular structures that appear at A&#x003b2; plaques both in patients and in animal models of AD. DNs are abundant in vesicular and granular organelles [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and are believed to be of axonal origin [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>] with connections to viable neuronal cell bodies [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Microglia, the primary immune cells of the brain express many AD risk genes [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and accumulate around A&#x003b2; plaques in human AD patients and in AD mouse models. They were found to closely associate with DNs in the brain of AD mice, but the functional role of this neuron-microglia interaction remains unknown [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The generation of Ox-stress and neuroinflammation at plaques has been hypothesized to be generated by A&#x003b2; acting on microglia [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] based on the expression of ROS generating enzymes in microglia, and reports that microglia secrete proinflammatory cytokines that induce Ox-stress in neurons [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Most recently it was suggested that microglia are the primary source of ROS in 5xFAD mice based on reduced inflammatory phenotypes of microglia <italic>in vitro</italic> by a small molecule which further ameliorates synaptic loss as well as reduced memory impairments [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, a direct causal link between microglial activation and Ox-stress at A&#x003b2; plaques has not been demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p id="p0050">To investigate the relationship between microglia and DN Ox-stress at A&#x003b2; plaques, we developed a strategy to combine <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of the new ratiometric redox sensor rogRFP2 [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] expressed in neurons with EGFP expression in microglia in 5xFAD AD mice. This allowed us to resolve relative degrees of Ox-stress in neurons at A&#x003b2; plaques <italic>in vivo,</italic> with simultaneous imaging of microglial morphology. In addition, we applied a new fixation technique that allowed us to preserve the oxidative state of roGFP1 to combine immunohistochemical (IHC) studies with <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of neuronal Ox-stress. The ability to combine Ox-stress imaging with IHC allowed us to investigate the correlation of other potential stressors to the generation of Ox-stress at A&#x003b2; plaques, such as NOX2 activation, and test the impact of microglia depletion on the degree of neuronal Ox-stress. While microglia are tightly associated with highly oxidized DN, we find that, surprisingly, Ox-stress of DNs was increased after microglia depletion suggesting that microglia are not the primary source of ROS at plaques in aged mice but may instead have a neuroprotective function. Therefore we performed IHC imaging of other potential contributors to ROS generation at A&#x003b2; plaques to investigate their correlation with increased Ox-stress as a first step to evaluating their potential as candidates for generating Ox-stress when microglia are partially depleted [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Multiple sources of ROS may contribute to the AD pathogenesis at A&#x003b2; plaques independently of microglia. For example, A&#x003b2; itself can form ROS catalyzed by redox active metal ions [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Other proposed sources of neuronal Ox-stress in AD are ROS overproduction by dysfunctional mitochondria [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and/or dysfunctional lysosomes that have been observed in DNs [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Redox levels in DNs were highly correlated with lysosome accumulation supporting suggestions they are principal contributors to Ox-stress in DNs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Tight associations between microglia and oxidized dystrophic neurites <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed by roGRFP2 imaging</title><p id="p0055">We first established imaging strategies to simultaneously investigate neuronal redox states with rogRFP2 and microglial cells in acute brain slices prepared from 12 months old 5xFAD x CX3CR1-EGFP mice (see methods, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). Neuronal rogRFP2 expression was induced by intracranial injection of AAV2/9-hSyn-rogRFP2. The promoter human synapsin 1(hSyn) was reported to be exclusively expressed in neurons and not glial cells [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This allowed us to image rogRFP2 redox levels in regions around A&#x003b2; plaques in 5xFAD x CX3CR1-EGFP mice to assess the extent of neuronal Ox-stress as well as the location and morphology of microglia. rogRFP2 expressing DNs can be readily found as swollen cellular structures surrounding A&#x003b2; plaques in these mice. A detailed description and illustration of rogRFP2 redox sensing properties are provided in the methods and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>. We used rogRFP2 because in addition to the green fluorescent redox sensing emission of roGFP2 it also displays a redox sensitive red fluorescent emission via &#x0223c;50% FRET to the linked red fluorescent protein mApple (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1a</xref>) [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, due to these unique properties of rogRFP2 there are two ratiometric redox ratios at different emission wavelengths that are caused by the same two-photon excitation at 800&#x000a0;nm and 900&#x000a0;nm as illustrated in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1a</xref>. The images of the green and red fluorescent output are shown in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1b</xref> and are plotted in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1c</xref>. The green emission of the directly redox sensitive roGFP2 is labeled R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>GFP</sub> and the red emission from the mApple (that is excited by FRET from the redox sensitive roGFP2) is labeled R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>RFP</sub>. rogRFP2 redox fluorescence is either displayed in pseudo colored green-red merged images (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a, left panel) or by showing the calculated redox ratios as a spectrum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a, right panel).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Microglia closely associate with highly oxidized dystrophic neurites (DN) <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed by long-term <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging through a cranial window in rogRFP2 expressing 5xFAD x CX3CR1-EGFP mice. <bold>a:</bold> rogRFP2 expression in 5xFAD mice show increased oxidative stress in DNs (see arrows) around amyloid plaques displaying red rogRFP2 emission (Em. 575&#x02013;640&#x000a0;nm).

We identified plaque associated microglia that only express EGFP in brain regions by digitally performing a raw pixel by pixel subtraction of rogRFP2 fluorescence from the images using FIJI channel subtraction (see methods). The structures expressing rogRFP2 were identified by the overlapping green and red emission (see methods and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1d</xref>). This approach was successful when EGFP expression was not brighter than rogRFP2 fluorescence to ensure successful channel subtraction (see methods). Using this technique, we found that highly oxidized DNs were often enwrapped by microglial cells in live tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b&#x02013;c, arrow). To validate functional rogRFP2 expression in DNs, we bath applied DTT (5&#x000a0;mM, reducing agent) or diamide (2&#x000a0;mM, oxidizing agent) and detected commensurate shifts in rogRFP2 readouts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d), indicating DNs responded to cytosolic redox changes. Shifts in redox ratios were observed using R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>RFP</sub> (red emission: Em. 575&#x02013;640&#x000a0;nm, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d; for green emission and R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>GFP</sub> images see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2</xref>). Although DNs appeared to be severely oxidized, the application of diamide resulted in significantly greater oxidation ratios indicating that DNs were not fully oxidized. We further confirmed that the CX3CR1-EGFP positive cells express P2YR12 and Iba1 identifying them as microglia (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S3</xref>). To further confirm that redox sensitivity is limited to rogRFP2 and not CX3CR1-EGFP we performed bath applications of DTT and diamide in mice with only CX3CR1-EGFP in microglia (i.e. no rogRFP2 expression) and found no shifts in fluorescence emissions of EGFP expressed in microglia using the rogRFP2 imaging settings (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="p0065">Functional rogRFP2 expression in DNs indicates that despite their swollen and peculiar morphology DNs are intact albeit unusual cellular structures. We further confirmed this by showing that DNs in acute brain slices of 12 months old mice do not take up propidium iodide, which labels dead cells (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Figs. S5a&#x02013;b</xref>). By performing patch-clamp experiments on DNs surrounding A&#x003b2; plaques we found that DNs had stable membrane potentials of &#x0223c;-60&#x000a0;mV and displayed potassium as well as sodium currents (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Figs. S5c&#x02013;e</xref>) further confirming their functional properties and intact membranes.</p><p id="p0070">The formation of A&#x003b2; plaques is correlated with a progressive increase in the number and size of oxidized DNs that develop over weeks to months [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. To monitor the spatiotemporal interactions between microglia and neuronal Ox-stress during DN formation, we performed longitudinal imaging of plaques and surrounding DNs and microglia <italic>in vivo</italic>. Chronic cranial windows were implanted into 5xFAD x CX3CR1-EGFP mice injected with the AAV-rogRFP2 vector followed by bi-weekly imaging sessions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>e). We employed our digital image subtraction strategy that we validated in brain slices to visualize microglia separately from DNs around A&#x003b2; plaques <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>f). Using our imaging parameters lipofuscin deposits that are commonly observed in older brains [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] were detected as very brightly autofluorescent puncta that were most pronounced in red emission [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] using 800&#x000a0;nm excitation and were excluded from analysis. We successfully followed 23 individual plaques from 3 mice, aged 8 to 9 months old, over 3-months. We identified DNs, quantified their rogRFP2 redox ratios and established whether microglia were associated with the DNs or not and tracked them over 7 imaging sessions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>g). Redox levels were quantified in two groups of DNs defined as either associated with, or not associated with microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>h). To account for changes in tissue optics at varying imaging depths, all redox ratios were normalized to redox levels from the surrounding neuropil. Interestingly, we found that DNs associated with microglia were substantially more oxidized throughout the entire imaging period (2.2-fold&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.6 vs. 1.48-fold &#x000b1; 0.34, pooled data all timepoints, ****p&#x0003c;0.0001). In addition, the total number of observed DNs increased over time (week 0 to week 12, **p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>i) as well as their size (week 0 to week 10, *p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01, week 0 to week 12, ****p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>i). This was attributed to an increase in DNs that were not associated with microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>j). Over the 12-week observation period only 2 plaques showed decreasing number of DNs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>k). We identified a subpopulation of persistent DNs that were trackable over several imaging sessions, and found location and presence of microglia to be extremely plastic with DNs and their location varying between imaging sessions. Three different regions of interest (ROI&#x02019;s) are marked in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>l, ROI 1 shows a region where both microglia and an oxidized DN were visible during only one imaging session indicating that they appeared and disappeared simultaneously.

ROI 3 shows an oxidized DN surrounded by microglia which appeared to be removed or reduced in size in consecutive imaging sessions.

As a first step we investigated the utility of immunohistochemical (IHC) staining after PFA fixation for identifying cell expression and in the second step we established a PFA fixation protocol that preserved the oxidative state of roGFP1 and was compatible with IHC staining.

One reason for this is the lack of imaging strategies to study microglia and neuronal Ox-stress simultaneously. Here, we employed the 5xFAD mouse model of AD to study redox levels in the vicinity of A&#x003b2; plaques. Plaques in these mice first form at 6 weeks postnatal and continued amyloidosis leads to increased plaque loads with memory deficits and neuronal loss as early as 9 months of age [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We utilized new methods to simultaneously image neuronal redox states and microglial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, in acute brain slices, and in PFA fixed tissue using the redox sensors rogRFP2 and roGFP1. Using these novel imaging strategies, we identified highly oxidized DNs surrounding A&#x003b2; plaques in 5xFAD mice. Our experimental approaches allowed us to examine the critical factors associated with the high level of Ox-stress in DNs. We found that microglia were preferentially associated with highly oxidized DNs. Surprisingly, removal of microglia from the brain exacerbated Ox-stress suggesting a neuroprotective role. However, depletion of microglia also rescued neuron loss confirming earlier reports [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The severity of Ox-stress in DNs correlates with the accumulation of lysosomes.</p><p id="p0170">DNs surrounding amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 were reported to be highly oxidized using the redox sensor roGFP1 [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Ox-stress was hypothesized to subsequently lead to neuronal death. Microglia were found to closely associate with DNs [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but the impact of microglia on Ox-stress in DNs was not previously investigated. A major obstacle for simultaneous neuronal redox and microglia imaging is that GFP expression, commonly used in microglia reporter mice, such as Csf1r-EGFP and CX3CR1-EGFP [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], does not allow for simultaneous imaging with roGFP redox sensors. Recently a variety of red fluorescent ratiometric redox sensors have been developed [<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>]. As an alternative approach, we employed rogRFP2, a next generation of a FRET-based roGFP-RFP fusion sensor [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] that allows for ratiometric redox imaging in both the green and red emission spectra. Expression of rogRFP2 in neurons of 5xFAD x CX3CR1-EGFP mice allowed us to simultaneously image microglia morphology as well as neuronal Ox-stress <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using repeated <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings of oxidized DNs and microglial cells, we found a dynamic turnover of DNs around plaques consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We conclude that microglia are attracted to highly oxidized DNs potentially triggering their removal by microglia.</p><p id="p0175">To further understand ROS generation in DNs and microglia interaction, we investigated roGFP1 redox ratios in PFA fixed brain tissue, allowing us to perform immunostaining while preserving the redox states of roGFP1. Previous studies demonstrated preservation of roGFP1 redox signals after fixation in mice [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and drosophila [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] when tissue fixation was combined with NEM which binds reactive thiol groups. Inclusion of NEM prevents future oxidation thereby locking roGFP in its oxidative state in the PFA fixed tissue. We successfully applied this technique in 5xFAD mouse brain slices to confirm the close interaction between microglia and severely oxidized DNs by staining for microglial marker proteins such as Iba1.</p><p id="p0180">We initially hypothesized that microglia are the major source of ROS generation leading to Ox-stress in DNs and subsequent neuronal damage. Surprisingly, after depleting brain microglia in 5xFAD mice using PLX3397 [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], we observed an increase in DN oxidation and their physical size. We also confirmed that PLX3397 treatment reduced neuron loss in 5xFAD mice as previously described [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These data indicate that microglia are not the primary source of neuronal Ox-stress in DNs surrounding A&#x003b2; plaques and further suggest that neuroprotective as well as neurotoxic phenotypes of microglia act in parallel since removal of microglia also reduces neuronal loss and improves memory formation [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, PLX induced depletion in younger (4 months) 5xFAD mice drastically reduced plaque formation in multiple brain regions, including cortex [<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Recently, it was suggested that microglia produce ROS in 6 months old 5xFAD mice based on the observation that a small molecule reduces inflammatory phenotypes in microglia <italic>in vitro</italic> and further reduces synaptic loss, whole tissue redox stress and astrogliosis while improving memory function <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These apparent contradictions will guide future studies because they may arise due to the following reasons: 1. Our observations of Ox-stress using roGFP1 and rogRFP2 are limited to the immediate plaque environment and only to neuronal Ox-stress. We cannot exclude substantial Ox-stress in microglia and astrocytes which we would not detect with our method but could be detected with whole tissue assays. 2. The age of the mice was different (6 months [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] vs. 12 months in our study) and it is possible that microglia phenotypes vary substantially by age. 3. Multiple potential pathways of ROS generation exist in AD. 4. Our PLX treatment may have depleted a specific population of microglia with a distinct function regarding ROS generation different than the surviving microglia. 5. Microglia depletion might lead to increased infiltration of peripheral immune cells such as CD3<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells as shown in PLX5622 treated APP/PS1 mice [<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The interaction of T-cells with the surviving population of microglia in the immediate plaque area could have impacted microglial ROS production leading to increased Ox-stress in DNs similar to reports of respiratory bursts of neutrophils after direct contact with activated T-cells [<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] adding another potential layer of complexity.</p><p id="p0185">Future experiments will test how earlier microglia depletion affects redox states in 5xFAD mice in different brain regions and what precise role non-microglial immune cells play in the generation of ROS in AD.</p><p id="p0190">In contrast to a previous study in APP/PS1 mice [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] we normalized roGFP1 redox ratios of DNs to the redox ratios in surrounding healthy neurons or the neuropil. Changes in tissue transparency both <italic>in vivo</italic> and in fixed tissue preparations could have a significant impact on redox ratios. The rational for using this particular normalization was based on the following two observations: 1) The resting redox states of healthy neurons appeared to be fully reduced because there was no further changes in their baseline redox states when DTT was applied (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1c</xref>); 2) Ox-stress was predominantly limited to the direct vicinity of A&#x003b2; plaques and redox ratio values of neuronal cell bodies and the neuropil were similar to that of non-tg controls in areas distant to plaques (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>d&#x02013;e). Note that the PLX induced increase in DNs Ox-stress was significant with and without normalization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>b,e).</p><p id="p0195">To further understand the underlying mechanisms of Ox-stress in DNs we imaged roGFP1 in parallel with immunostaining of putative contributors to ROS generation in 5xFAD tissue. We show that the initially high BACE1 activity declined as oxidation became more severe. The continued accumulation of A&#x003b2; in and around DNs suggests that A&#x003b2; itself is a likely player in generating Ox-stress around A&#x003b2; plaques of 5xFAD mice. To support this hypothesis, we investigated the impact of intracranial A&#x003b2; injection into the cortex of wild-type mice and found that A&#x003b2; alone was sufficient to induce Ox-stress in neurons. In addition, in the transgenic 5xFAD mice, we found a negative correlation between DN Ox-stress and microglia coverage around A&#x003b2; plaques. This suggests that microglia shield surrounding tissue from A&#x003b2; exposure as previously proposed by Condello et al. [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The formation of this &#x02018;microglia barrier&#x02019; surrounding A&#x003b2; plaques was suggested to be neuroprotective evident by increased expression of protofibrillar A&#x003b2;-42 in subregions of plaques which were not covered by microglia which also correlated with increase in DNs in areas lacking microglia coverage [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This supports our hypothesis that a lack of microglia coverage leads to more A&#x003b2; exposure to DNs and subsequently is a plausible cause of increased Ox-stress. The discovery of mutations leading to partial loss of function of TREM2, a transmembrane receptor exclusively expressed in microglia in the brain, have highlighted neuroprotective functions of microglia in AD in recent years [<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Loss of function in TREM2 was found to result in reduced numbers of microglia surrounding plaques and an almost complete loss of microglial encapsulation leading to increased severity of DN formation [<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It was suggested that the neuroprotective effect of this microglial function stems from accelerated aggregation of A&#x003b2; rather than increased phagocytic activity [<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p id="p0200">We investigated the potential links between lysosomal dysfunction and DNs based on previous studies [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The accumulation of LAMP1 positive lysosomes was strongly correlated with Ox-stress severity in DNs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>e&#x02013;f). In addition, the lysosome enriched DNs were very immunopositive for ubiquitin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>g&#x02013;i) which could indicate the presence of dysfunctional lysosomes in these structures [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Based on previous reports that lysosomes are highly oxidized at rest [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we hypothesize that membrane permeabilization in dysfunctional lysosomes [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] could be central to Ox-stress in DNs surrounding A&#x003b2; plaques. Most recently, lysosomal membrane permeabilization surrounding amyloid plaques was linked to neuron loss in 5xFAD mice [<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In addition, lysosomal accumulation, and upregulation of lysosomal enzymes in oxidized DNs could also be a compensatory mechanism to counterbalance ROS as a key function for lysosomes is the degradation of dysfunctional organelles and proteins [<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Microglia depletion with PLX led to higher LAMP1 levels in enlarged DNs. This increase in lysosomal numbers and lysosomal enzymes could be due to increased uptake and subsequent degradation of A&#x003b2; inside DNs due to reduced microglial coverage around plaques.</p><p id="p0205">We propose that deciphering the causal relationship of lysosomal accumulation in either generating or responding to Ox-stress in DNs should be a key avenue for future research. Recent reports that Ox-stress only occurs in symptomatic AD patients but not in non-symptomatic patients with AD neuropathology [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] strongly underline the need to further understand the detailed underlying mechanisms of how Ox-stress is generated in AD.</p><p id="p0210">Our observation that depleting microglia from the brain increased the degree of Ox-stress of DNs, suggests microglia may promote redox homeostasis of DNs. However, paradoxically neuronal death was also reduced illustrating the difficulties in attributing neuroprotective versus neurotoxic functions of microglial cells in AD [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. When Ox-stress in DNs surrounding A&#x003b2; plaques was first reported the authors suggested that Ox-stress precedes a Caspase-3 dependent cell death pathway in neurons [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since Ox-stress in DNs can persist for several weeks or even months it appears likely that a cell death pathway is not triggered immediately after Ox-stress occurs. We propose that A&#x003b2; is a key initial trigger for Ox-stress generation in DNs. The generation of DNs, and their subsequent lysosome accumulation, was suggested to occur due to A&#x003b2; induced dysfunction in the cytoskeleton of axons [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, stabilizing microtubules was shown to reduce the number of DNs and to improve memory functions in AD mice [<xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Depletion of microglia might therefore increase A&#x003b2; exposure to neurons and subsequently exacerbate Ox-stress in DNs due to more cytoskeleton dysruptions and lysosome accumulation in our aged 5xFAD mice. Alternatively, microglia may acquire neurotoxic phenotypes in later stages of amyloidosis in AD and AD models [<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] that could explain why the depletion of microglia reduces the loss of neurons in 5xFAD. This age dependent neurotoxic phenotype may ultimately overshadow the neuroprotective effects. Understanding the exact pathways of these underlying phenotypes will be a crucial aim for future studies to pharmacologically target microglial functions to both ameliorate Ox-stress and to reduce neuron death in AD.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Animals</title><p id="p0215">All animal care protocols were approved by the University of British Columbia&#x02019;s Animal Care Committee in compliance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. 5xFAD mice [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] were either crossbred with C57BL/6 mice (experiments using roGFP1) or crossbred with CX3CR1-EGFP mice (experiments using rogRFP2).

This involved expressing in 5xFAD x CX3CR1-EGFP transgenic mice, the recently developed rogRFP2, a second-generation FRET based fusion ratiometric redox sensor. The rogRFP2 FRET sensor is a fusion of roGFP2 with the red fluorescent protein mApple [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The reduction-oxidation sensitive protein roGFP2 is the redox sensing part of the construct, linked to mApple via a fixed length amino acid sequence, and serves as an excitation ratiometric sensor [<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. roGFP (both roGFP1 and roGFP2) contains specific insertions of cysteines in close proximity to the fluorophore which allow for the formation of disulfide bonds upon protein oxidation. Disulfide bond formation shifts the excitation maximum to a lower wavelength (excited with &#x0223c;800&#x000a0;nm for 2-photon imaging) while the excitation properties of reduced roGFP is closer to native GFP (excited with &#x0223c;900&#x000a0;nm for 2-photon imaging). However, the roGFP emission spectrum is not altered by its oxidation state. Thus, rogRFP2 is alternately excited by 800 and 900&#x000a0;nm to allow for time series or z-stack recordings (for 2-photon imaging, channel I and II respectively) and the green fluorescence (Em. 500&#x02013;550&#x000a0;nm) is acquired for both channels. The advantage of rogRFP2 is that the green fluorescence emission of roGFP2 generates red fluorescence (Em. 575&#x02013;640&#x000a0;nm) emission from mApple via FRET transfer of &#x0223c;50% of the redox sensitive green emission of roGFP2 [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The emission is acquired for both excitation wavelengths (channel III and IV). Since the two proteins are linked via a fixed spatial distance the redox sensitive green emission is transferred into a ratiometric red emission. This has the advantage of expanding the redox sensing properties to the red emission spectrum (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1a</xref>) and allows analysis of the EGFP-microglia that only exhibit green fluorescence but do not show the overlapping red fluorescence that occurs with rogRFP2.</p><p id="p0245">First, functional neuronal expression of rogRFP2 was validated by injecting AAV2/9-hSyn-rogRFP2 (2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L each hemisphere, somatosensory cortex, 1&#x000a0;mm deep) into C57BL/6 mice following 2-photon imaging in acute brain slices 4 weeks post-injection. After stable redox ratios were observed in rogRFP2 expressing neurons, the intracellular oxidizing agent diamide (2&#x000a0;mM) was bath applied following by washout and superfusion with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT, 5&#x000a0;mM). This progressive bath application of diamide followed by DTT demonstrated that rogRFP2 ratios in expressing neurons and dendrites were modified by reducing and oxidizing agents thereby validating functional expression (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1c</xref>). For every time frame of the recording a redox ratio was quantified for both the green (R<sub>OX</sub>F<sub>GFP</sub>, dividing channel I by II) and red emission (R<sub>OX</sub>F<sub>RFP</sub>, dividing channel III by IV) of rogRFP2. As reported earlier, rogRFP2 dynamic range is lower in the red emission channel due to incomplete FRET and contamination of intrinsic redox-insensitive mApple fluorescence [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1c</xref>). We confirmed that only green and red emission of rogRFP2 in DNs and neurons (but not EGFP in microglia, see also <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4</xref>) were sensitive to DTT or diamide by analysing redox changes in DNs associated with microglia. Shifts in rogRFP2 were only detected in DNs with no measurable changes in EGFP-expressing microglia (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1e</xref>).

Microglia in these mice exhibit only green fluorescence whereas rogRFP2 expressing neurons exhibit both green and red fluorescence with this dual excitation at 800 and 900&#x000a0;nm. Therefore, post-hoc analysis entailing the digital subtraction of the red emission from the green emission channel removed signals from neurons and allowed us to observe the microglial-specific green fluorescence to reveal their location and morphology in the tissue with respect to neurons expressing the redox sensor (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1d</xref>). The fluorescence intensity values of both red emission channels (III and IV) were combined and added together by raw channel addition using FIJI (in order to cover both oxidized and reduced neuronal rogRFP2) and subsequently subtracted from green emission channel II. Channel II was chosen for this because microglial EGFP emission is much brighter using 900&#x000a0;nm instead of 800&#x000a0;nm excitation wavelengths and therefore offers much better channel subtraction results. To avoid any potential contamination of neuronal Ox-stress by microglial EGFP fluorescence, we chose to restrict our rogRFP2 analysis to the red fluorescence spectrum and R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>RFP</sub>. Note that for the channel subtraction to effectively reveal microglial morphology the rogRFP2 expression and brightness can not exceed microglial EGFP expression. Therefore, we carefully selected regions in the cortex in which rogRFP2 fluorescence intensities were similar to EGFP. In future studies the use of a red fluorescent microglia reporter mouse in conjunction with roGFP1 would be useful for separating microglial morphology from neuronal Ox-stress.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.8"><label>4.8</label><title>Long-term <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging</title><p id="p0255">After the AAV-rogRFP2 vector was injected into 5xFAD x CX3CR1-EGFP mice chronic cranial windows (4&#x000a0;mm diameter) were inserted during the same surgery.</p><p id="p0260">Mice were allowed to recover for 4 weeks before 7 consecutive bi-weekly 2-photon imaging sessions were conducted.

AAV2/9-hSyn-rogRFP2 was injected into CX3CR1-EGFP expressing non-tg or 5xFAD mice. Schematics of the FRET-based fusion sensor rogRFP2 consisting of the redox sensing roGFP2 that is linked with a fixed length amino acid linker to the red fluorescent mApple. roGFP2 is alternatingly excited with 800 or 900&#x000a0;nm (using 2-photon (2p) microscopy) and the resulting redox sensitive green emission (Em. 500&#x02013;550&#x000a0;nm) is partially transferred to the mApple by FRET resulting in red emission (Em. 575&#x02013;640&#x000a0;nm) that varies in accordance with the redox sensitive roGFP2 portion of the rogRFP2. Green emission is highlighted by dashed green boxes and red emission by dashed red boxes. This sensor allows ratiometric redox imaging using red shifted emission wavelengths. Switching excitation wavelengths allows for live time series or z-stack recordings. <bold>b:</bold> Acute imaging of rogRFP2 in brain slices of non-tg mice following diamide and DTT exposure confirms that both green and red emissions of rogRFP2 are redox sensitive and two redox ratios can be quantified (R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>GFP</sub> and R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>RFP</sub>). Note that pseudocoloring is used to always display redox states in green and red merged images for both R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>GFP</sub> and R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>RFP.</sub> All imaging channels are displayed in the upper part whereas the resulting redox ratios are shown in the lower part. Quantification of the time series recording is shown in <bold>c</bold>. <bold>d:</bold> Inducing rogRFP2 expression in CX3CR1-EGFP mice results in fluorescent neurons and microglia. Microglia are green fluorescent while neurons are both green and red fluorescent. Digitally subtracting the red fluorescence emission that is only emitted from rogRFP2 neurons from the green fluorescence emission channels subtracts the fluorescence emission from neurons leaving only the green fluorescence from EGFP expressing microglial cells. As a result, microglia morphology and neuronal redox states (either R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>GFP</sub> or R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>RFP</sub>) can be imaged simultaneously and analyzed separately. Microglia cell is indicated with an arrow. <bold>e:</bold> A zoomed in image of a DN is shown next to a microglia in a 5xFAD mouse brain. Only the green and red emission from the small DN is redox sensitive while there are no redox sensitive changes in EGFP fluorescence in the microglial process. <bold>f:</bold> roGFP1 allows ratio metric redox imaging using two different excitation wavelengths, either 405/488&#x000a0;nm for confocal 1-photon microscopy (1p) or 800/900&#x000a0;nm for 2-photon imaging. The ratio of the green emission (Em. 500&#x02013;550&#x000a0;nm) acquired after exciting with both wavelengths (channel I/ channel II) is defined as the redox ratio (R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>GFP</sub>) the same way R<sub>ox</sub>F<sub>GFP</sub> was calculated and generated for rogRFP2. Mice, non-transgenic (non-tg) or 5xFAD, were intracranially injected with AAV2/9-CBA-roGFP1 to induce neuronal expression of roGFP1.

<bold>Why is the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) important?</bold>
</p><p>MDD is a leading cause of disability worldwide and in China, where it often remains undiagnosed and undertreated. The impact of MDD on a person&#x02019;s ability to function in work, social life, and family life can be significant. Therefore, improvements in a patient&#x02019;s symptoms and ability to function throughout the day are important for increasing the chances of overall recovery.</p><p>
<bold>What question does this study answer?</bold>
</p><p>Clinical trials have shown that the antidepressant vortioxetine is safe and effective for the treatment of MDD. These trials were performed in a controlled environment with a small group of similar people, and therefore may not provide clear answers for all people living with MDD. The current study helps fill this gap by evaluating vortioxetine in a large population of patients with MDD seen in routine clinical practice in China, leading to a broader understanding of how vortioxetine works in a real-world setting.</p><p>
<bold>What did we find and what does it mean?</bold>
</p><p>Patients treated with vortioxetine showed improvement in overall ability to function at 24 weeks compared with baseline, including functioning within work/school, social life, and family life/home responsibilities. Patients also showed improvement in depression severity, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms, such as attention, concentration, and organization. These findings are consistent with previous studies and support the real-world effectiveness of vortioxetine in people living with MDD in China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0002"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common condition, affecting more than 163 million people worldwide,<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and its prevalence is increasing.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Estimates of the lifetime prevalence of MDD in China vary, ranging from 1.8% to 6.9%.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> As the second-leading cause of years lived with disability in China, MDD imposes a substantial burden on patients, impairing both functioning and quality of life.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> MDD also exacts a significant societal burden through both direct and indirect costs.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, the majority of patients with MDD remain undiagnosed,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and MDD is often undertreated.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A meta-analysis of 15 studies of patients with MDD in China indicated that only 19.5% of patients are treated, possibly due to patients not disclosing their symptoms to healthcare professionals and not seeking specialist mental health support to avoid stigma and discrimination associated with a diagnosis of MDD.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Accordingly, the National Health Commission of China released an action plan in 2020 for the prevention and control of depression to address the growing burden of depression in China.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Patients with MDD frequently experience significant functional impairment, including reduced physical function (eg, the ability to engage in sports or perform activities of daily living), lower work productivity (eg, absenteeism), and poor psychosocial functioning (eg, the ability to recognize social cues).<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The cognitive symptoms associated with MDD can also contribute to MDD-related social, functional, and work-related disability.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;18</xref> Approximately three-quarters of patients with MDD in China present with cognitive impairment, which continues for approximately one-third of patients after 6 months of treatment,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> resulting in impaired quality of life and productivity, independent of the severity of depressive symptoms.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> Therefore, both symptomatic and functional improvement during treatment of MDD are desirable for increasing patients&#x02019; chances of recovery and restoration.</p><p>Vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant authorized for use in patients with MDD in the United States since 2013, is approved in more than 80 countries worldwide.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Vortioxetine has demonstrated efficacy, safety, and an ability to improve cognitive symptoms in patients with MDD in a large clinical development program;<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;26</xref> it also has a significant effect on overall patient functioning.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> These randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of vortioxetine in controlled environments according to strict protocol criteria that limit patient eligibility, and thus heterogeneity and investigator discretionary treatment; however, the effectiveness of vortioxetine in real-world clinical practice remains to be determined because RCTs tend to be highly selective, homogeneous, and based on a predefined set of inclusion criteria to support regulatory approval of the drug.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Accordingly, the results potentially lack generalizability to the diverse patient populations encountered in clinical practice, including Asian patients.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Thus, observational studies are conducted to improve understanding of treatment outcomes in a real-world setting.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>This observational study complements the findings from RCTs by providing valuable data on the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of vortioxetine in a real-world clinical setting.

Patients were excluded if they had a comorbid ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other neurodegenerative disease that significantly affected cognitive functioning. Patients were also excluded if their current MDE was resistant to treatment with 2 other antidepressants or if they had attempted suicide within the last 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="s0003-s2002"><title>Study Assessments</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the change from baseline to weeks 8 and 24 in overall functioning as measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; range: 0&#x02013;30; higher scores indicate greater impairment in functioning). Secondary objectives included assessment of change from baseline to weeks 8 and 24 in depression severity, cognitive symptoms, functioning subdomains, and severity of anxiety symptoms. Depression severity was assessed by the patient using the Patient Health Questionnaire&#x02013;9 items (PHQ-9) and by the physician using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale&#x02013;17 items (HAM-D17), Clinical Global Impressions&#x02013;Severity (CGI-S), and Clinical Global Impressions&#x02013;Improvement (CGI-I), with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Cognitive symptoms were assessed using the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire&#x02013;Depression (PDQ-D) total score, while 3 subdomains of the SDS were used to assess function in work, social life, and family life. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale&#x02013;7 items (GAD-7) total score was used to assess anxiety symptoms. Response (&#x02265;50% decrease in HAM-D17) and remission (HAM-D17 &#x02264;7) rates were also calculated.</p><p>Adverse events (AEs) were assessed and recorded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 23.0. Vortioxetine doses of &#x0003e;10 to 20 mg were coded as a &#x0201c;prescribed overdose&#x0201d; because dosing at this level was not approved by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration until the conclusion of the study in August 2020.</p></sec><sec id="s0003-s2003"><title>Statistics</title><p>The study planned to enroll 1000 participants, assuming that information would not be available for 40% of participants at week 8 and 38% at week 24.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> These participant numbers were expected to result in a precision of 8% and 7% for SDS assessments at weeks 8 and 24, respectively.

However, the current study population observed was younger than the population found to have an MDE or depressive symptoms when screening &#x0003e;500,000 Chinese people (33 vs 51 years).<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The National Health Commission of China&#x02019;s action plan to implement a screening program to improve the diagnosis of MDD in China will no doubt identify a significant proportion of the population who are currently undiagnosed and may benefit from vortioxetine therapy.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Importantly, despite approximately 80% of Chinese people with an MDE reporting loss of interest, insomnia, tiredness, and difficulty concentrating, &#x0003c;10% of individuals are receiving specific medications for their symptoms.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Given the high proportion of patients in China diagnosed with MDD and presenting with cognitive impairment, which often continues in patients after receiving antidepressant therapy,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> vortioxetine offers an important treatment option to address these symptoms.

Therefore, any prescribed dosage of &#x0003e;10 mg to 20 mg of vortioxetine has been coded as a prescribed overdose in the context of this study, even though this dosing regimen was approved in many jurisdictions outside China. However, the interim results of this study<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> demonstrated safety of the higher dose, and the need for higher dosing to achieve adequate effectiveness in some patients, directly supporting the need for an expanded label for vortioxetine in China.</p><p>While the mechanisms of action of many herbal medicines used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have not been fully characterized, they are hypothesized to involve some pathways also targeted by antidepressants.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Therefore, the absence of drug-drug interaction&#x02013;related AEs is important in a real-world population of patients in China, where TCM has historically been used to treat depression, and many patients use herbal medicine, vitamins, and other health products to manage MDD.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>This study has several strengths, including a large sample size and long-term follow-up over 6 months.

However, this study was limited by its observational nature, the lack of a comparator arm, and patients being enrolled both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have affected treatment and visit patterns. The lack of a comparator arm also means that the relative effectiveness of vortioxetine versus other treatment options could not be assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study supports the short- and long-term effectiveness of vortioxetine in patients with MDD in a real-world setting in China and was consistent with the efficacy and safety profile of vortioxetine observed during RCTs. Particularly, patients treated with vortioxetine demonstrated reduced functional impairment as assessed by SDS score, which was associated with a high remission rate, and depression severity decreased after initiating treatment. Cognitive symptoms and anxiety symptoms also improved. Vortioxetine was well tolerated in this large population of patients with MDD, with no new safety concerns observed compared with prior RCTs. These findings support the effectiveness of vortioxetine in the treatment of patients with MDD in China in a real-world setting.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank all participants in the study, as well as the investigators and sites involved in conducting the trial including Yuping Ning, Tianmei Si, Yanqing Tang, Yonggui Yuan, Xiancang Ma, Hanping Bai, Daihui Peng, Lina Wang, Tao Li, Chunxue Wang, Lingjiang Li, Bin Zhang, and Yi Xu.</p></ack><sec id="s0007"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article.

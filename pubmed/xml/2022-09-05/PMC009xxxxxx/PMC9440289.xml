The authors presented a set of secondary data from the Federal State Statistics Service and the Investment Projects Digital Platform, which reflect the cost of implementing projects in the Far Eastern Federal District. These data were presented to characterize the region as deeply diversified, with a predominance of the livestock and fishing sectors. The authors identified the most promising investment projects in various regions of the Far Eastern Federal District and assessed their attractiveness in terms of accessibility to transportation. The result was a map of the implementation of the main areas of investment activity, taking into account transport connectivity.

Today, investment portals have been created in the region and strategies have been adopted. Active work is underway to improve the investment climate in all constituent entities of the Far Eastern District. First, the authorities have begun to implement the investment standard. The &#x0201c;one-stop-shop&#x0201d; mode has been introduced almost throughout the region, and investment councils are working under the governors&#x02019; offices <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. There is a methodology for selecting priority investment projects, as well as projects planned for implementation in the Far East with the attraction of funds from the federal budget <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The Far East is a promising region of Russia. Based on geographical and climatic characteristics, the competitive advantages of the Russian Far East are more than 50 types of natural, volcanic, and effusive formations, polymetallic and iron ores, and other minerals; rich biological resources. This macroregion has reserves of valuable timber and medicinal plants. The territory is home to rare animals. Different kinds of fish and seafood are harvested. Mariculture is developed; in the temperate zone, the climatic conditions are favourable for agriculture; vegetables, grains, root crops, and others are grown; in dense river networks and fast rivers, which have great potential for the construction of hydroelectric plants. The large rivers have transport importance (Amur, Zeya, Selemdzha, Bureya, Ussuri, Amgun). There are exits to the seas and oceans; - energy resources; - a high potential to have recreational resources; - a favourable geographical location to major markets in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan, China, and South Korea; however, there is no single highway. There are only two railroads and; an underdeveloped telecommunications system <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The authors note that all subjects of the district are very different from each other in terms of the conditions of business <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

The data characterize production as multidirectional, with fish production predominating. The dynamics of basic food production in the subjects of the FEFD is multidirectional. Production of meat from 2017 to 2019 decreased by 22.1%, cereals by 12%, and bread and bakery products by 6.3%. Production growth occurred in such products as milk - by 11.3%, vegetable oil - by 9.5%, processed and canned fish, crustaceans and mollusks - by 5.4%, butter - by 9.8%. Flour production increased 2.9 times. It is obvious that the FEFD can provide itself with many types of products. And investment and development of agro-projects will help to improve the state of agriculture both within the region and to improve the quality of work in the international market, for example, in the markets of China and India. According to the table, we are seeing strong growth in the production and processing of fish and marine products. The Russian Far East specializes in this, all of its coastal part. In 2017, the catch of fish and marine products was 2448 thousand tons, and in 2019 by 131 thousand tons, productivity increased. The second most produced and demanded product in the Far East is bread and bakery products. But the dynamics for three years shows a decrease by 22 thousand tons. Production of drinks and bottled water is steadily growing for three years at an average of 37 million half-liters. Production of butter and oil pastes is in the least demand, but there is a positive trend (by 0.4 thousand tons) in this period. In general, the food basket is fully represented, but the northern regions of the FEFD do not provide themselves with vegetables and fruits, which also provides an opportunity to invest in these sectors of crop production for self-sufficiency in food security.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0001">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Products</th><th valign="top">2017</th><th valign="top">2018</th><th valign="top">2019</th><th valign="top">2019 to 2017, %</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Meat, thousand tones.</td><td valign="top">76.8</td><td valign="top">75.6</td><td valign="top">55.2</td><td valign="top">71.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sausage products, thousand tones</td><td valign="top">99.0</td><td valign="top">100.0</td><td valign="top">99.4</td><td valign="top">100.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Processed fish and canned fish, crustaceans and mollusks, thousand tones.</td><td valign="top">2448.0</td><td valign="top">2560.0</td><td valign="top">2579.0</td><td valign="top">105.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Vegetable oils and their fractions unrefined, thousand tones</td><td valign="top">63.3</td><td valign="top">75.8</td><td valign="top">69.3</td><td valign="top">109.5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Milk, other than raw milk, thousand tones</td><td valign="top">159.0</td><td valign="top">162.0</td><td valign="top">177.0</td><td valign="top">111.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Butter and butter pastes, thousand tones</td><td valign="top">4.1</td><td valign="top">4.3</td><td valign="top">4.5</td><td valign="top">109.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Flour, thousand tones</td><td valign="top">10.7</td><td valign="top">15.7</td><td valign="top">30.7</td><td valign="top">286.9</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cereal, thousand tones</td><td valign="top">21.7</td><td valign="top">17.4</td><td valign="top">19.1</td><td valign="top">88.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Bread and bakery products, thousand tones</td><td valign="top">300.0</td><td valign="top">290.0</td><td valign="top">278.0</td><td valign="top">92.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Beer, millions of decaliters</td><td valign="top">30.4</td><td valign="top">31.2</td><td valign="top">30.2</td><td valign="top">99.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Drinking water, million half-litres</td><td valign="top">277.0</td><td valign="top">321.0</td><td valign="top">351.0</td><td valign="top">126.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Source: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gks.ru/bgd/regl/b20_14p/Main.htm" id="interref0007">https://www.gks.ru/bgd/regl/b20_14p/Main.htm</ext-link></p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="para0024">The dynamics of basic food production in the subjects of the FEFD is multidirectional.

And investment and development of agro-projects will help to improve the state of agriculture both within the region and to improve the quality of work in the international market, for example, in the markets of China and India.</p><p id="para0025">According to the table, we are seeing strong growth in the production and processing of fish and marine products. The Russian Far East specializes in this, all of its coastal part. In 2017, the catch of fish and marine products was 2448 thousand tons, and in 2019 by 131 thousand tons, productivity increased. The second most produced and demanded product in the Far East is bread and bakery products. But the dynamics for three years shows a decrease by 22 thousand tons. Production of drinks and bottled water is steadily growing for three years at an average of 37 million half-liters. Production of butter and oil pastes is in the least demand, but there is a positive trend (by 0.4 thousand tons) in this period. In general, the food basket is fully represented, but the northern regions of the FEFD do not provide themselves with vegetables and fruits, which also provides an opportunity to invest in these sectors of crop production for self-sufficiency in food security.</p><p id="para0026"><xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>.

The characteristics of the categories of agricultural enterprises in the regions of Russia, especially in the Far Eastern Federal District, make it possible to assess whether the category of farms is linked to a certain type of agricultural structure and their relationship between them. As for the regions of the Far Eastern Federal District, a breakdown by crops makes it possible to assess which areas are involved in their production. So, for example, in grain cultivation, out of 11 territories, only eight regions participate in this. The main share falls on large agricultural enterprises. Grain is not grown in the Sakhalin and Magadan Regions and the Chukotka Autonomous Area. Also, for the cultivation of sunflower for the period from 2005 to 2019, in 6 areas of the Far Eastern Federal District out of 11, sunflower is not grown at all, which is associated with harsh natural and climatic conditions. In the remaining five regions, sunflower is cultivated only in households. Also, concerning potatoes, these crops are grown in all 11 regions of the Far Eastern Federal District, and the primary share of its production falls on households. The same situation is with growing vegetables. In the livestock sector, all 11 regions of the Far Eastern Federal District are involved in the producing meat, dairy, and poultry products, and households also account for the pivot share.

The northern areas of the Khabarovsk and Trans-Baikal Territories, the Amur Region, and the Republic of Buryatia fall out of this pattern, which can be attributed to the high transaction costs in these locations for processing products. The prospects are related to the technological development of the main lines, declared in the speed of movement along the Trans-Siberian Railway, the new stage of the Baikal-Amur mainline, which will attract investors from the processing position in the production sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0007"><title>Ethics statements</title><p id="para0075">The article is an original research work, is not published anywhere, and consists of 9 pages of text, 2 tables, 7 figures, and an additional table in the Harvard Dataverse repository (second materials), all authors have read and approved and know the idea.</p></sec><sec id="sec0007a"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="para0075a"><bold>Inga Nikolaevna Ryumkina:</bold> Validation, Visualization. <bold>Vitaly Viktorovich Aleschenko:</bold> Methodology, Project administration, Supervision. <bold>Olga Alexandrovna Aleschenko:</bold> Software, Data curation, Writing &#x02013; original draft. <bold>Evgeny Vladimirovich Rudoy:</bold> Formal analysis, Resources, Funding acquisition. <bold>Marina Sergeevna Petukhova:</bold> Investigation, Formal analysis. <bold>Sergey Vladimirovich Ryumkin:</bold> Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="para0078">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that have, or could be perceived to have, influenced the work reported in this article.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0001"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gunya</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kolbovsky</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gairabekov</surname><given-names>U.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>GIS-modeling and mapping for sustainable development of mountain regions</article-title><source>InterCarto.

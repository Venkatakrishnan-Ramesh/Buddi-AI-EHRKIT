But experts say it is still worth wearing a mask to protect yourself, even if no one else does.</p><p>While public health messaging has tended to emphasize the importance of wearing a mask to protect others, numerous studies have demonstrated that the right mask protects the wearer, too.</p><p>&#x0201c;We have collectively done a poor job at communicating the strong efficacy of N95 respirators,&#x0201d; according to Lisa Brosseau, a bioaerosol scientist and industrial hygienist at the University of Minnesota&#x02019;s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.</p><p>Recent data from the United States shows that people who always wore a face mask in indoor public settings were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 than those who never wore a mask.</p><p>Better quality masks offered greater protection. Wearing an N95 or KN95 respirator lowered the odds of infection by 83%, whereas wearing a surgical mask or cloth mask lowered the odds by 66% and 56%, respectively.</p><p>Fit matters, too. Properly fitted N95 respirators should filter at least 95% of virus particles. That&#x02019;s notably better than the protection offered by universal masking with cloth and surgical masks, which would have fallen on the lower end of 75%&#x02013;91% at the height of compliance with mandates.</p><p>Even a loose-fitting N95 can filter 57%&#x02013;86% of particles, according to Japanese research. In comparison, surgical masks filtered 47%&#x02013;50% of particles, while a simple cotton mask filtered 17%&#x02013;20%.</p><p>However, the protection masks offer is time-limited.</p><p>In 2021, Brosseau and colleagues estimated it would take up to 1.25 hours for a person wearing a non-fit-tested N95 to receive an &#x0201c;infectious dose&#x0201d; of SARS-CoV-2 from an unmasked infectious person. In contrast, it may take just 15 minutes if both people are unmasked, or 20&#x02013;30 minutes if one of them wore a cloth or surgical mask.</p><p>Brosseau has since cautioned that these estimates don&#x02019;t account for highly infectious variants like Omicron and should not be taken as a &#x0201c;bright line between when you&#x02019;re safe and when you&#x02019;re not safe.&#x0201d;</p><p>The findings of a more recent modelling study suggested that a person has a 90% risk of infection within a few minutes of speaking to someone with SARS-CoV-2 if neither is wearing a mask, even if they&#x02019;re standing three meters apart. Wearing the European equivalent of an N95 mask dropped that risk to 20%, even after one hour.</p><p>&#x0201c;Just wearing a mask &#x02014; it helps, but it is not going to turn being indoors into something that has no risk,&#x0201d; Jose-Luis Jimenez, an aerosols scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder, told <italic>NPR</italic>. When it comes to crowded indoor environments with poor ventilation, &#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t think it can be made very safe,&#x0201d; he said.</p></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-194e682"><p>Posted on <ext-link xlink:href="http://cmajnews.com" ext-link-type="uri">cmajnews.com</ext-link> on April 29, 2022</p></fn></fn-group></back></article>

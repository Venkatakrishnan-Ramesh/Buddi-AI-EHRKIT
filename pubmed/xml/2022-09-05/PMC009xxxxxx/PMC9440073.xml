Although numerous postoperative therapeutic strategies have already been developed, including radiotherapy, tumors inevitably recur after several years of treatment. The coinhibitory molecule B7&#x02013;H4 negatively regulates T cell immune responses and promotes immune escape. Exosomes mediate intercellular communication and initiate immune evasion in the tumor microenvironment (TME).</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>This study aimed to determine whether B7&#x02013;H4 is upregulated by radiation and loaded into exosomes, thus contributing to immunosuppression and enhancing tumor growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Iodixanol density-gradient centrifugation and flow cytometry were used to verify exosomal B7&#x02013;H4. Na&#x000ef;ve T cells were differentiated into Th1 cells, with or without exosomes. T cell-secreted cytokines and markers of T cell subsets were measured. Mechanistically, the roles of B7&#x02013;H4, and ALIX in GBM were analyzed using databases and tissue samples. Co&#x02010;immunoprecipitation, and pull-down assays were used to tested the direct interactions between ATM and ALIX or STAT3. <italic>In vitro</italic> ATM kinase assays, western blotting, and site-directed mutation were used to assess ATM-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation. Finally, the contribution of exosomal B7&#x02013;H4 to immunosuppression and tumor growth was investigated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Exosomes from irradiated GBM cells decreased the anti-tumor immune response of T cell <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> via delivered B7&#x02013;H4. Mechanistically, irradiation promoted exosome biogenesis by increasing the ATM-ALIX interaction. Furthermore, the ATM-phosphorylated STAT3 was found to directly binds to the <italic>B7&#x02013;H4</italic> promoter to increase its expression. Finally, the radiation-induced increase in exosomal B7&#x02013;H4 induced FoxP3 expression during Th1 cell differentiation via the activated STAT1 pathway<italic>.

Our results suggest that co-administration of radiotherapy with anti-B7-H4 therapy could improve local tumor control and identify exosomal B7&#x02013;H4 as a potential tumor biomarker.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>B7-H4</kwd><kwd>Exosome</kwd><kwd>Tumor microenvironment (TME)</kwd><kwd>Glioblastoma (GBM)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Background</title><p id="p0015">Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable and fatal tumor among adults, which originates from the central nervous system (CNS). GBM is the most common primary malignant brain tumor with an incidence rate of 3.20 per 100,000 population in the USA [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Current standard treatment for newly diagnosed GBM comprises surgical resection, adjuvant radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Despite these aggressive strategies, radio-resistance leads to tumor recurrence in most patients and results in a median overall survival (OS) of only 12&#x02013;15 months after diagnosis [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, it is imperative to investigate the underlying mechanism of tumor recurrence after irradiation to improve patient prognosis.</p><p id="p0020">Components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) have pivotal roles in determining radiotherapy outcomes [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In GBM, the TME is infiltrated with leukocytes, mostly T helper (Th) cells, and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells. It has been found that effector CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells promote tumor destruction, while Treg cells are associated with poor prognosis in GBM through their inhibition of the antitumor responses [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Moreover, radiation has been shown to have immunological effects, including the occasional induction of systemic antitumor response, the so-called &#x0201c;abscopal effect&#x0201d;, and enhanced immunosuppression [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the relationship between irradiated GBM and tumor-infiltrating T cells is undetermined.</p><p id="p0025">The B7&#x02013;H4 (v-set domain containing T cell activation inhibitor 1, VTCN1, also known as B7x), expressed on various tumor cells, is a member of the CD28/B7 family of immune co-inhibitory molecules. B7&#x02013;H4 activity is associated with a decreased inflammatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response and increased Tregs within the TME [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Meanwhile, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), another co-inhibitory molecule, is found on the surface of exosomes [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Exosomes comprise a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous structures of &#x0223c;40&#x02013;160&#x000a0;nm in diameter [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Exosomes are involved in GBM tumor progression and TME modification, and are thus emerging as potential therapeutic targets of tumors [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Whether exosomal B7&#x02013;H4, which might induce local immunosuppression, can be detected in irradiated GBM cells is unknown.</p><p id="p0030">Therefore, the present study investigated the role of irradiation in GBM cells secreting exosomal B7&#x02013;H4 and in the T cell immune response. Exosomes from irradiated GBM cells were observed to inhibit the anti-tumor immune potential of T cells and promote tumor growth. Furthermore, irradiation promoted exosome production by increasing the interaction between the kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and apoptosis-linked gene 2-interacting protein X (PDCDIP, also known as ALIX) and induced B7&#x02013;H4 expression via ATM-mediated phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Finally, exosomal B7&#x02013;H4 enhanced Foxp3 expression of differentiating Th1 cells via STAT1 pathway inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p id="p0035">Murine GL261, human GBM cells LN229 and LN308, and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were purchased from the cell bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).

Such findings are consistent with our result that irradiated GBM cells lead to a heightened immunosuppressive environment and subsequent tumor radio-resistance.</p><p id="p0195">Exosomal PD-L1 levels correlate with disease progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. GL261 cell-released exosomes express PD-L1 on their surface and play an important role in blocking T cell activation and proliferation in response to T cell receptor stimulation [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The coinhibitory molecule B7&#x02013;H4, which is overexpressed in many human cancers, is an important member of the B7/CD28 family. However, B7&#x02013;H4's presence in cancer cell-derived exosomes and its role in tumor progression are largely unknown. Our results indicated that increased exosomal B7&#x02013;H4 from irradiated GBM cells induces FoxP3 expression during Th1 cell differentiation. To our knowledge, no study has reported the involvement of tumor cell-derived exosomal B7&#x02013;H4 in Th1 conversion to Tregs.</p><p id="p0200">B7&#x02013;H4 is upregulated in various types of cancers and is associated with poor clinical outcome [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic>, <italic>B7&#x02013;H4</italic> is transcriptionally upregulated in cell lines in response to hypoxia and transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;), via hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) 1&#x003b1; and STAT3 [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Functionally, B7&#x02013;H4 overexpression in tumor cells plays a dominant role in inhibiting T cell antitumor responses through multiple pathways [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Similarly, our results indicated that B7&#x02013;H4 expression is associated with glioma grade and poor prognosis of GBM patients, partly by increasing FoxP3 expression during Th1 cell differentiation. Mechanistically, STAT3 binds to the <italic>B7&#x02013;H4</italic> promoter and upregulates <italic>B7&#x02013;H4</italic> expression in GBM cells. We speculated that B7&#x02013;H4 could be a promising biomarker for immunotherapy in patients with glioma. Generally, when activated, the fate of na&#x000ef;ve T cells is dictated by the cytokines they receive from the inflammatory milieu. Many factors can regulate Th1 differentiation and IFN-&#x003b3; production [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; however, the role of B7&#x02013;H4 in Th1 differentiation was unknown. This study presents evidence that B7&#x02013;H4 induces Foxp3 expression, which inhibits Th1 cell differentiation, providing a mechanism for the effect of B7&#x02013;H4 on T cell antitumor immune responses.</p><p id="p0205">ATM kinase is required for PD-L1 upregulation in response to radiation-induced DNA damage [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the relationship between ATM signaling and B7&#x02013;H4 expression in cancer cells is still unexplored. In this study, we showed that irradiation upregulates B7&#x02013;H4 expression via the ATM/STAT3 signaling pathway. The transcription factor STAT3 is often upregulated in tumor cells and is a recognized negative prognostic factor [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly, our results indicated that STAT3 expression is associated with poor survival. Further study indicated that ATM directly phosphorylates STAT3, increasing B7&#x02013;H4 expression. Moreover, we showed that ATM phosphorylates STAT3 at S181 and S691 residues. However, the exact mechanism as to how phosphorylated STAT3 regulates its interaction with the <italic>B&#x02013;7H4</italic> promoter warrants further studies. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying B7&#x02013;H4 expression in cancer cells may contribute to improve the efficacy of combined anti-B7-H4 therapy and radiotherapy.</p><p id="p0210">Overall, the results of the present study showed that irradiated GBM cells inhibit the anti-tumor immune responses of T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mechanistically, irradiation promotes exosome production by increasing the interaction of ATM with ALIX, and induces the expression of exosomal B7&#x02013;H4 via ATM-phosphorylated STAT3. In turn, the exosomal B7&#x02013;H4 induces FoxP3 expression in differentiating Th1 cells via STAT1 pathway inactivation. However, some potential limitations in this study should be noted. Our findings support the co-administration of radiotherapy with anti-B7-H4 therapy to improve local tumor control. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical basis for exosomal B7&#x02013;H4 as a potential tumor biomarker; however, further investigation in blood or cerebrospinal fluid is required.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0215">Author contributions are listed as follows: Yunhong Tian, Chunshan Liu, Zhiyong Li, and Meiling Ai did the experiments and analyzed the data.

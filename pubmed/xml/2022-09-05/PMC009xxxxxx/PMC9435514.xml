With Ontario&#x02019;s recent investment in centralized surgical wait-list management, we sought to understand the views of health system leaders on the role of SEMs in managing the elective surgery backlog.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the qualitative method of interpretive description to explore participant perspectives and identify practical strategies for policy-makers, administrators and clinical leaders. We conducted semistructured interviews with health system leaders from across Ontario on Zoom between March and June 2021. We used snowball and purposive sampling. Inclusion criteria included Ontario health care leaders, fluent in English or French, in positions relevant to managing the elective surgery backlog. Exclusion criteria were individuals who work outside Ontario, or do not hold relevant roles.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Our interviews with 10 health system leaders &#x02014; including hospital chief executive officers, surgeons, administrators and policy experts &#x02014; resulted in 5 emergent domains: perceptions of the backlog, operationalizing and financing SEMs, barriers, facilitators, and equity and patient factors. All participants emphasized the need for clinical leaders to champion SEMs and the utility of SEMs in managing wait-lists for high-volume, low-acuity, low-complexity and low-variation surgeries.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation:</title><p>Although SEMs are no panacea, the participants in our study stated that they believe SEMs can improve quality and reduce variability in wait times when SEMs are designed to address local needs and are implemented with buy-in from champions. Health care leaders should consider SEMs for improving surgical backlog management in their local jurisdictions.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>COVID-19 has overwhelmed many health systems that were already having difficulty meeting public need before the pandemic.<xref rid="b1-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> One of the areas most affected in Canada has been the backlog in elective surgeries. <xref rid="b2-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In Canada, &#x0201c;elective&#x0201d; refers to any surgery that is scheduled in advance.

I mean, you can&#x02019;t do surgery, big surgery, if there&#x02019;s no ICU bed available or if you can&#x02019;t do the case. So you&#x02019;re gonna have a single entry, but can&#x02019;t do the case so it won&#x02019;t end up making a difference. There&#x02019;s a lot to this and I don&#x02019;t want to discourage you, but the concept of everybody waiting for one doctor, unless it is a very specialized process.

There are procedures where you want one or two people&#x0201d; (P2)<break/>&#x0201c;Having a standardized framework across the board will be helpful. One, one barrier to that will be every hospital has totally different &#x02026; Given the independence of individual hospitals in the province, compared to other jurisdictions, every hospital might have their own policies that they&#x02019;re empowered to make on their own &#x02026; So having a central policy when it comes to surgeries, and SEM will likely be challenging given how the hospital system currently operates.

So we would actually really have to craft the messaging clearly around how does this benefit patients, how does this benefit you and how does it benefit [our organization], and really understand the downsides of those SEMs. And to really tackle those barriers head on, whatever they may be, I think many surgeons have this misconception that it will, they&#x02019;ll lose income, or lose patients out of it&#x0201d; (P7)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1">Facilitators to implementing SEM</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Benefits of SEM</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0201c;So we have what are called rapid access clinics in each LHIN, where family physicians refer to one place, and then assess the patient. I think it&#x02019;s regarding lower back pain they&#x02019;re first assessed by advanced practice physio, and then if they are deemed eligible for surgery then they&#x02019;re referred to the first available surgeon. So that&#x02019;s, that&#x02019;s kind of a good example of a successful SEM because, not only is it triaging folks to the most available surgeon, but it&#x02019;s also identifying before they get to the surgeon, whether they actually need surgery or not. Because surgeons get a lot of inappropriate referrals, and a lot of people don&#x02019;t need surgery and you settle down into an alternative pathway of conservative management&#x0201d; (P6)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Getting a win-win-win</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0201c;I think if you really want something to work well, it&#x02019;s great to have a win-win-win.

There&#x02019;s a win for them. And then for surgeons. If the win can be, you know, that it will kind of make your life easier, because you&#x02019;re not struggling to find, find OR time for somebody who&#x02019;s a little bit more urgent or something like that &#x02014; you see what I mean. So, like, I think you can make an argument that for a single entry that there, there is an argument that there is a win-win-win there. And I think if that happens then it&#x02019;ll be successful. If it&#x02019;s not a win-win-win &#x02014; like, if it&#x02019;s a lose for somebody &#x02014; it&#x02019;s probably gonna fall apart&#x0201d; (P1)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Impact on wait times</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0201c;So will it flatten the disparity of wait-list from surgeon to surgeon?

And there&#x02019;s much better data around how long you&#x02019;re waiting, depending on where you live, so on. And we have things like the first available surgeon program so that if there&#x02019;s two of us working in the hospital, my waiting list is a year and the guy next door&#x02019;s waiting list is three months, the patient&#x02019;s given the option of seeing the three-month guy&#x0201d; (P5)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1">Operationalizing and financing a SEM</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Improving capacity</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0201c;Another initiative that we&#x02019;ve been working on is surgical smoothing to increase efficiency and throughput for operating rooms, so we&#x02019;re enabling better scheduling systems for individual hospitals in order to maximize all scheduled surgeries to ensure there&#x02019;s no time that&#x02019;s lost. We&#x02019;re also leveraging public hospital and private clinic partnerships, or community clinic partnerships. And a number of hospitals have essentially put together their own independent partnerships with clinics in their regions. So I know, for instance, one hospital has a partnership with a cataract clinic, and that hospital now oversees all operations of that clinic and it&#x02019;s essentially extra OR time, extra labour, and they have that partnership that the ministry doesn&#x02019;t oversee&#x0201d; (P3)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Performance management</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0201c;Obviously, you really want to know about qualitative data like patient acceptance and quality of care in the eyes of the patient and in the eyes of the caregivers.

That&#x02019;s the sort of thing that&#x02019;s going to change attitudes if it could be shown for the government that yes, we can do more and more efficiently for hospitals, that yes, we can do these on an outpatient basis and we can still look after our patients with COVID-19 and the other disasters that come in.

Okay. So the family doctor would send somebody to me, and they&#x02019;d say, well, maybe you need your knee operated on, I&#x02019;ll send you to see the orthopedic surgeon. So months later, they would see the orthopedic surgeon, right, because he had this huge waiting list.

And in this case, you gotta take everyone. An eye is an eye is an eye. And I mean, that&#x02019;s the truth of it. I&#x02019;m not suggesting surgeons do that now or are malicious or deliberate about doing it. But as we know, through this pandemic, with all the other social issues that have come into play, there is a, there&#x02019;s a bias. There&#x02019;s a bias and this allows individuals from marginalized communities to get world-class eye care. Why should they be denied or cherry-picked? They shouldn&#x02019;t.

One participant mentioned an &#x0201c;after-the-earthquake effect,&#x0201d; in which patients flood the system when it opens up. Participants agreed that Ontario&#x02019;s model of elective surgical care delivery before the pandemic contributed to current problems: There is no &#x0201c;cushion&#x0201d; against these disruptions; the system was unable to cope with a major stress. Funding models whereby certain procedures, such as cataracts or arthroplasties, are incentivized over others were cited as a contributing factor, as well as a shortage of nurses.</p></sec><sec><title>Facilitators to implementing SEMs</title><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Impact on wait times</title><p>All participants agreed that implementing SEMs would improve wait times overall and increase efficiencies across the board. One participant who designed an SEM and trialled it in Toronto said that wait times went down dramatically. The number of patient visits not resulting in surgery also decreased. However, participants acknowledged that SEMs are no panacea to fundamental issues with the health system. All participants believed that health care leaders should respond urgently to the pandemic&#x02019;s disruptions and not let a crisis pass them by.</p></sec><sec><title>Getting a win-win-win</title><p>Single-entry models could succeed if they present a &#x0201c;win-win-win&#x0201d; for patients, family physicians and surgeons. Existing funding models for surgery promote competition and the need to acquire patients and market share, rather than the equitable dispersion of patients that might occur in SEMs. Most participants believed that piloting SEMs and scaling up is key to ensuring success and assuaging skeptics. Stakeholder engagement is also crucial to SEM sustainability, which may include patient choice to opt in.</p></sec><sec><title>Benefits of SEMs</title><p>Participants spoke about team-based care as vital to SEMs. The benefits of shared-care SEMs ranged from patient outcomes to tangible benefits to surgeons&#x02019; lifestyles. All participants agreed that SEMs would make elective surgical care more efficient and also decrease the indirect costs of care by lowering costs associated with patients not being in pain, as an example. Participants also agreed that SEMs would be most effective when complemented by other strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Barriers to implementing SEMs</title><sec><title>Engaging providers</title><p>Participants agreed that surgeons&#x02019; concerns are the largest barrier to implementing SEMs. Long wait-lists were perceived as a source of pride for surgeons, and to give that up would be a &#x0201c;blow to their ego.&#x0201d; Many participants mentioned that maintaining long wait-lists provides surgeons with financial security. Convincing referring physicians to adopt SEMs was seen as another barrier: It might prove difficult to ask family physicians to disregard their personal connections and history of referrals.</p></sec><sec><title>Concerns about standardization</title><p>Participants cited the lack of a standard model or definition for SEMs as a barrier to adoption. Hospitals and surgeon groups operate in silos, so metrics must be developed to ensure surgeons provide consistent quality. This change management and cultural shift would require tremendous leadership. The current system, in which hospitals advocate and compete for surgeries, makes it difficult for stakeholders to collaborate.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Operationalizing and financing SEMs</title><sec><title>Improving capacity</title><p>Participants felt that improving capacity is necessary to shorten wait times. One participant noted that the current system does not easily adjust to larger volumes. Although all participants agreed that there is a place for SEMs, many argued that SEMs would work only with capacity adjustments. Suggested adjustments included designating centres for outpatient surgery, providing hospitals with premium and one-time funding to open operating rooms (ORs) on evenings and weekends, and investing in diagnostics to enable a higher volume of surgeries. Surgical smoothing &#x02014; or deliberately scheduling elective surgeries to decrease variability in case volumes &#x02014; was discussed as another strategy for running ORs more efficiently. One participant (a surgeon-administrator) mentioned appropriateness: Will an operation necessarily improve patients&#x02019; functioning and quality of life?</p></sec><sec><title>Performance management</title><p>Single-entry models require an iterative process of quality improvement in which patients, referring physicians and surgeons provide feedback on their experience with central intake forms and triage. Participants agreed that SEM performance should be measured with quantitative and qualitative data, including patient acceptance and quality of care.<xref rid="b12-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Quantifiable measures mentioned by participants included case numbers, case efficiency and wait times.</p></sec><sec><title>Resource availability</title><p>Participants discussed resource availability with respect to 3 subtopics: administrative capacity, financing and personnel. One participant stated that training staff to adopt changes presented an administrative burden. Others expressed that a single booking system might alleviate the administrative burden for physicians and administrators. Participants proposed funding to incentivize more hospital-to-hospital transfers and transfers of volumes rather than hospitals acting as independent corporations. One participant characterized SEMs as shared-care models, which divide responsibilities and may include income-sharing practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical type considerations</title><p>Participants agreed that high-volume, low-acuity and low-complexity, low-variation procedures or surgeries &#x02014; including hernia repair or joint replacement &#x02014; are most suitable for SEMs. Participants noted the unsuitability of SEMs for low-volume and complex procedures. The question of prioritization was also discussed &#x02014; whether priority would be based on timestamp or urgency &#x02014; and which parties are involved in making this determination. These decisions directly affect outcomes and timeliness of care received through SEMs.</p></sec><sec><title>Ways to motivate stakeholders</title><p>Most participants identified the role of champions in SEM implementation. One participant recommended formal consultations with groups such as the Ontario Hospital Association, the Ontario Medical Association and specialty groups to ensure widespread stakeholder support. Physician leadership is needed to champion SEMs, from someone who is a trusted and recognized senior opinion leader in their field. Participants emphasized consensus, saying surgeons would &#x0201c;buy in&#x0201d; if they saw evidence of benefit to surgeons and patients. Finally, one participant recommended carefully listening to and addressing critics, as their insights can prevent errors during implementation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Equity and patient factors</title><p>Participants agreed that implementing SEMs would increase equity and access to care, given that SEMs triage patients based on objective criteria such as urgency and necessity. However, all participants acknowledged that SEMs are vulnerable to the biases of their developers. However, following the principles of pooled wait-lists, single point-of-entry and a fair and objective triage would be a step forward, according to many participants.</p><p>There was likewise an overwhelming sentiment that SEMs would increase equity among surgeons &#x02014; particularly for young, female or racialized surgeons. SEMs could help reduce the inequitable distribution of referrals by reducing the influence of social ties.</p><p>Respondents expressed that successful SEM implementation is contingent upon the patient&#x02013;family physician relationship. When family physicians imply that they are referring their patients to &#x0201c;the best surgeon,&#x0201d; it increases fears that others are less competent. However, if family physicians endorse SEMs, it would increase patient trust and acceptance.</p><p>Finally, participants emphasized patient autonomy. Giving patients the freedom to decide whether to wait for a surgeon or receive timely care was considered important to the provision of patient-centred care.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Interpretation</title><p>In this study, we investigated stakeholder perspectives on SEMs&#x02019; role in managing elective surgery backlogs. Domains included perceptions of the backlog, operationalizing and financing SEMs, facilitators, barriers, and equity and patient factors. All participants reiterated the transformative potential of SEMs and their utility in managing wait-lists for &#x0201c;commodity&#x0201d; procedures (using &#x0201c;commodity&#x0201d; in the economic sense, signifying a mass-produced unspecialized product): high-volume, low-acuity, low-complexity and low-variation surgeries. Although SEMs will not alleviate the backlog entirely, participants believed they would be a useful tool for managing it. Single-entry models would prove most beneficial if implemented in tandem with other strategies, especially to improve system capacity.</p><p>Ontario&#x02019;s July 2021 surgical recovery plan explicitly included central intake, which our findings can inform how to operationalize. Milakovic and colleagues found that SEM implementation was reliably associated with a decrease in wait times for initial outpatient visit to a specialist.<xref rid="b13-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The reduction in wait times was even more pronounced for surgeries and other high-priority referrals.<xref rid="b13-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> While previous studies have found that SEMs decrease wait times and wait-list length,<xref rid="b11-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b14-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> new evidence is available which demonstrates potential benefits of SEMs beyond surgery and in relation to implementation strategies, as well as for patient and provider satisfaction.<xref rid="b13-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b30-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>Most studies investigating SEMs have had largely similar conclusions to the domains explored by our study participants. Lopatina and colleagues conducted a symposium on Canadian SEMs and found that there are multiple interpretations on how SEMs should be designed.<xref rid="b12-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Their interview participants highlighted how SEMs are similar in that they have a single point of entry, but that the way in which patients transit through a system varies beyond the common intake point. A question that arose in our interviews was how the quality appropriateness of referrals would be affected by SEM implementation; an American study evaluating a centralized rheumatology referral and triage program found that the appropriateness of referrals improved post-SEM introduction.<xref rid="b31-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, it has also been reported that referring doctors&#x02019; sense of ownership over their patients may suffer when referring into a centralized system.<xref rid="b11-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b13-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Although our study participants did not identify this concern, it should surely be accounted for when implementing SEMs.</p><p>Implementing SEMs will require support from champions and appropriate incentives for stakeholders. Despite consensus that SEMs can help manage the backlog, there remains concern about SEMs&#x02019; potential consequences for surgeon&#x02013;patient relationships, surgeon autonomy and surgeons&#x02019; financial security.<xref rid="b10-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Referring physicians overwhelmingly prefer SEMs,<xref rid="b32-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and patients prefer the next available provider if it means more timely access,<xref rid="b11-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> yet surgeons remain hesitant. To overcome this discrepancy, our findings highlight how buy-in from senior leaders and surgeons is essential to implementing SEMs.</p><p>The literature on SEMs contains few Canadian examples. <xref rid="b10-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Further, SEMs were originally developed and studied in western Canada.<xref rid="b14-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b16-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Some of our participants were involved in designing and implementing SEMs studied by other researchers.<xref rid="b11-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b13-cmajo.20210234" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has several limitations. As is common for qualitative research, we have a small sample size. Our sample was also pre-eminently Toronto based, with significant experience in SEMs or wait-list management broadly. Although our participants spoke with authority given their experience and content expertise, we received less data directly from younger and more rural surgeons who would be directly affected by the implementation of an SEM in their jurisdiction. Given the small number of SEMs that have been developed in Ontario, the pool of local content experts was not large. However, we achieved thematic saturation with this number of participants. Moreover, any potential selection bias of participants was mitigated by a robust sampling framework to source participants with diverse experiences relating to SEMs, health administration and wait-list management.</p><p>We acknowledge our own biases as well in study design and analysis. Our participants and researchers are based in Ontario, and as such our findings should be considered in light of the province&#x02019;s unique cultural and political context. Further research should incorporate the perspectives of patients and referring physicians.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although SEMs are not a panacea, our study participants believe they can improve quality and reduce variability in wait times when designed to address local needs, and implemented with buy-in from champions. Single-entry models are one strategy that can be used to manage the elective surgery backlog in Canada. Given the unique opportunity to implement transformational changes as we enter the postpandemic world, clinical leaders and policy-makers should consider SEMs for improving the management of surgical backlogs in their local jurisdictions.</p><p>Our results can inform future studies and guide policymakers and stakeholders as they design and implement SEMs. Future research should evaluate how SEMs function in practice, furthering the data generated from this exploratory study. Other strategies to manage surgical backlogs should also be evaluated. Finally, further research should incorporate the perspectives of patients and referring physicians.</p></sec></sec>

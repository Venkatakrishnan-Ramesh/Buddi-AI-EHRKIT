Although some successes have been achieved in development of TE-ATMPs, such as tissue-engineered bladder, skin, cartilage, trachea and blood vessels, towards replacing damaged organs or restoring their function, an enormous challenge remain regarding to the rational construction of TE-ATMPs with robustness and predictive outcomes [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To address it, a &#x0201c;developmental engineering&#x0201d; strategy conceptual and technical merging of developmental biology and biological engineering is arising, which strive to mimic developmental events such as cellular self-assembly and condensation to guarantee the predictive function and robustness of the constructed TE-ATMPs [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. By this way, appropriate cellular self-assemblies are pivotal initiators for the formation of geometric and functional tissue structures that capable of executing developmental programs to advocate and facilitate the organogenesis processes including the auto-proliferative differentiation and extracellular vesicles (exosome) release [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, it can be anticipated that developmentally engineered bio-assemblies can tackle the hurdle of the limited predictive <italic>in vivo</italic> performance of tissue-engineered medicinal products in the repair of complex tissues such as nervous system.</p><p id="p0015">Spinal cord injury (SCI), one of the toughest central nervous system injuries to treat, occurs with a worldwide incidence of over one ten-thousandth annually [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cruelly, patients suffering from this complicated neuropathological condition have to endure not only the physical functional dysfunction and even paralysis but also the heavy mental burden to their individuals as well as their families [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To bail out this dilemma and promote functional recovery of spinal cord, two general strategies have emerged: 1) surgical operation in conjunction with intravenous high-dose neuritepromoting factors such as antagonists to extracellular inhibitory molecule, neurotrophic factors, neuroprotective factors and permissive substrates [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>], and 2) stem cell and/or TE-ATMPs transplantation towards replacing the nerve defect and promoting the axon regeneration [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Over the past decade, the first therapeutic strategy resulted in over 35% drop in SCI deaths, because that the popularity of the surgical decompression as well as connection technique in SCI healing treatment and the development of the adjuvant medical therapy promote the neuroplasticity derived from axonal sprouting and synaptic remodeling. <sup>8, 14</sup> However, this therapeutic strategy has so far failed to make an impact on the course of the SCI and on clinical outcomes in reversing the physical functional dysfunction and even paralysis of patients [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As for the second strategy, by the way of the stem cell and/or TE-ATMPs transplantation, some positive clinical progresses have been achieved [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>], in especial of chronic SCI therapy [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], whereas significant challenges remain with regard to robust regeneration of injured axons and substantial functional recovery from severe or even complete SCI. Indeed, only a small amount of transplanted stem cells extremely fortunate to survive and a tiny part of them actually differentiate into neural cells in injured spinal cord [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Recently, accumulating evidence revealed that therapeutic efficacy recognized to stem cells attributed to the auxo-action of neuroplasticity profiting from their extracellular secretion in especial of extracellular microvesicles rather than cell replacement [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">After SCI, to cope with the demands of neuronal activity and connective neurofeedback, neuroplasticity can occur whereby the transected axons spontaneously regrow across a lesion site in various forms encompassing collateral axonal sprouting as well as structural synaptic remodeling [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Theoretically, in this case, the fractured neural circuit can be reorganized, and the physiological function can be restored as a consequence [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Nevertheless, few axons actually regenerate successfully, especially for long distances, due to the troublesome physical and molecular barrier - Astrocyte scar [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. After SCI, as limitans border between the lesion core and adjacent viable nerve, narrow astrocyte scars can restrict the spread of inflammation but block axon growth, invalidating the neuroplasticity [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Fortunately, neural stem cells (NSC)- and/or mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived exosomes, a class of natural extracellular microvesicle of endosomal origin with grain diameter range from 50 to 150&#x000a0;&#x0200b;nm, have been identified the strong biological function for promoting axons growth and suppressing astrocyte scars as well as inflammation [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>]. As MSC is easy to obtain from funicle, endodontium, fat and et&#x000a0;al. in sharp contrast to the intricate and destructive separation and extraction of NSC, increasing researches have revealed the potential of MSC and MSC-derived exosomes in SCI therapy [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, two high hurdles remain to overcome: 1) there exists limited knowledge about which kind of MSC exosomes is the best choice for SCI repair, and 2) exosomes therapeutics entails the use of time-consuming and laborious extraction process. Presumably because of these two hurdles, none of exosomes or their derivatives has so far been approved for clinical application towards promoting neuroplasticity.</p><p id="p0025">During the embryonic development, neural plate invaginates to form the neural tube and the subsequent spinal cord [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], which was facilitated by the extracellular microvesicle derived from pluripotent cell at the margin of the neural plate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A) [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Herein, we firstly approved the optimal auxo-action in axons regeneration of exosome derived from pulp-derived MSC (DPMSC) that developed from these pluripotent cells at the margin of the neural plate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Next, Under the guidance of the embryonic development theory that appropriate cellular coarctations or aggregations are pivotal initiators for the formation of geometric and functional tissue structures [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], a developmentally engineered strategy was established to assemble DPMSCs into a bio-assembly through a three-level sequential induction programme including reductant, energy and mechanical force stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Excitingly, in possession of the similar geometric construction and mechanical property with spinal cord, this bio-assembly is employed as a biomimetic <bold>spin</bold>al rest<bold>or</bold>er, thereby terming <bold>Spinor</bold>. More importantly, the Spinor-derived exosome showed its predictive <italic>in vivo</italic> performance in facilitating axonal sprouting and synaptic remodeling through releasing exosomes with the optimal quantity and auxo-action for promoting axons growth and suppressing astrocyte scars as well as inflammation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A). As a spinal cord fascia and exosome mothership, Spinor supported the reemergence of electrophysiological activity as well as behavior in rats with complete spinal cord injury and enabled them walking functional recovery. Collectively, Spinor will provide a promising clinical therapeutic application for severe or even complete SCI, and supported a new thought to amplify the intrinsic capabilities of stem-cells-derived exosome. More importantly, the developmentally engineered strategy established here will likely have a broad impact on the development of tissue-engineered advanced therapy medicinal products and reinvigorate the efforts for employing stem cells as well as their ramifications in the repair of complex tissues including nervous system.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The design and characterization analysis of the developmentally engineered bio-assembly termed Spinor.

Firstly, dental pulp-derived MSC (DPMSC), umbilical cord-derived MSC (UCMSC) and bone marrow-derived MSC (BMMSC) were identified by the paralleled expression of the MSC markers CD73, CD146 and CD105 and the concomitant absence of other cell-type markers CD11b, CD34 and CD45 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1A</xref>). Next, four important neurotrophic factors were semi-quantified at transcriptional level by RT-PCR in the three MSCs, and it can be found in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1B</xref> that the relative expression of BDNF, b-FGF, CTNF and NT-3 were significantly greater in DPMSC than BMMSC and UCMSC. This result compelled us further investigated the action of exosomes from DPMSC. Towards this end, exosomes were extracted from DPMSC, BMMSC and UCMSC by isodensity centrifugation immediately following by size exclusion chromatography. Co-incubating with neuronal cells, DPMSC-derived exosomes showed the strongest effect on promoting the axonal sprouting in contrast to UCMSC-derived exosomes and BMMSC-derived exosomes (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1C</xref>&#x00026;D). As shown in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1E</xref>, DPMSC exosome statistically significantly increased the branch points and neurite counts of neurons comparting with UCMSC and BMMSC exosome. Meanwhile, DPMSC-derived exosomes facilitate the elongation of the neuron length (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S1E</xref>), further suggesting the auxo-action of DPMSC exosome in promoting the regeneration and differentiation of neurons.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Establishing developmentally engineered strategy to assemble DPMSCs into a bio-assembly</title><p id="p0035">Firstly, the pluripotent stem cell characterization of DPMSCs were identified through their capacity of single-colony clusters formation (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S2A</xref>) and osteogenic differentiation (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S2B</xref>). Next, these DPMSC cultured with medium containing 10% FBS, increasing in number about 100-fold after 3 passages. Following these preparatory work, under the guidance of the embryonic development theory that appropriate cellular coarctations or clustering are pivotal initiators for the formation of geometric and functional tissue structures [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], a three-step developmentally engineered strategy was performed to assemble DPMSCs into a bio-assembly: step 1) simulating germ cell clustering and developing to induce DPMSCs assembly into MSC-derived thin file (MSCF) by the ascorbic acid (AA) stimulation, 2) simulating tissue development to induce MSCF coarctation into DPMSCs congeries (DM<sub>C</sub>) <italic>via</italic> the triphosadenine (ATP) stimulation, and 3) simulating organogenesis to induce DMc crispation to Spinor through mechanical force (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A and B). In details, AA was added into the medium to stimulate the self-assembly of DPMSC into a thin-film structure in this first step (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>A&#x00026;B), because of the auxo-action of AA in the intercellular adhesion <italic>via</italic> collagenous fiber formation [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, to optimize the formation of MSCF, various concentrations of AA was applied, and it can be found that about 100&#x000a0;&#x0200b;&#x003bc;g/ml AA had the strongest effects on the film construction (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S3A</xref>) and collagen secretion (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S3B</xref>). Moreover, AA at the dosage of 100&#x000a0;&#x0200b;&#x003bc;g/ml induced the most collagen accumulation after 5-days incubation (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S3C</xref>). After that in the second step, ATP was added into the culture medium of MSCF to induce the formation of stacked arrangement [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] termed DMc, as evidenced by the photo and H&#x00026;E staining in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>B and C.

As evidenced by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>D), Spinor possessed well-interconnected pore internal structure that is analogous to the internal anatomical structure of spinal cord, which were desired to support neural stem cells attachment, proliferation, differentiation and migration, thereby guiding and promoting the axon regeneration [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>]. Furthermore, atomic force microscope (AFM) measurement in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>E revealed that the longitudinal section of Spinor had the similar surface topography and mechanical property with the spinal cord, suggesting the splendid biological and tissue compatibility of Spinor.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Spinor-derived exosomes possessed optimized properties both in quantity and quality</title><p id="p0040">It has been known that stem-cell-derived exosomes play crucial roles for the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which compelled us to investigate the quantity and quality of the Spinor-derived exosomes. Towards this end, exosomes from Spinor and DPMSC were comparatively characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S4A</xref>), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA, <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S4B</xref>) and the identified markers of exosomes (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig.&#x000a0;S4C</xref>). To quantify the amount of exosome, we continuously determinated the total protein content by ELISA in exosomes derived from 1 million cells both in the form of DPMSC and Spinor.

in assisted reproductive technology (ART) for several
reasons including fertility preservation before initiation of
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and vasectomy, for patients
with diabetes and autoimmune disorders (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). It could also
be used for people with azoospermia without affecting
ART outcomes in comparison with fresh controls (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).
However, cryopreservation may have detrimental effects
on spermatozoa including cold shock, formation of
intracellular and extracellular ice crystals, osmotic shock,
and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that
may affect sperm motility (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Spermatozoa are unique
cells with a high level of polyunsaturated fatty acid in
their plasma membrane, a high number of mitochondria,
a low volume of cytoplasm, and antioxidant potential that
make the spermatozoa vulnerable to cryopreservation (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). </p><p>Encapsulation technology has lately been suggested as a
potential favorable method to preserve spermatozoa during
cryopreservation. Alginate, an anionic polysaccharide
derived from brown seaweed, has been extensively used
for several biomedical applications because of its high
biocompatibility, relatively low cost, and low toxicity
(<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Supplementation with sodium alginate also helped
the metal chelating capacities and free radical scavenging
to preserve buffalo sperm during cryopreservation (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).
More importantly, cell encapsulation in alginate is an
encouraging approach during cryopreservation as cells
could be protected against mechanical destruction during
ice crystallization (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It has been shown that alginate
mimics the extracellular matrixes for spermatogonial
stem cells supporting the potential of their stemness
during the cryopreservation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Also, the fertilizing
potential of cryopreserved sperm using alginate
encapsulation did not change in buffalo (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It was shown
that microencapsulation could mechanically inhibit
spermatozoa movement. However, it did not negatively
impact the intracytoplasmic sperm injection results
and a high rate of the vitality of immotile spermatozoa
was observed. Also, alginate microencapsulation could
preserve spermatozoa from the risk of contamination with
foreign material, either spermatozoa or genetic material
(<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Controlled-release alginate capsules having boar
spermatozoa have also been utilized to increase the time of
spermatozoa preservation and maximize the effectiveness
of single artificial insemination (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Also, the alginate
microencapsulation method has been used successfully
to cryopreserve canine sperm by extending the post-thaw
motility, viability, and acrosomal integrity (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>There are limited data about the cryoprotective effects
of alginate on human spermatozoa. Herrler et al. only
evaluated the effects of human cell encapsulation on sperm
motility and viability (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). They showed that alginate
encapsulation using a slow freezing technique decreased
human sperm motility while no difference was observed
for sperm viability. It seems that using sperm encapsulation
in cryopreservation needs to be adjusted. This study aimed
to evaluate the effects of alginate encapsulation on human
sperm motility, viability, acrosome reaction, and DNA
integrity during rapid freezing. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Collecting and preparing samples</title><p>Twenty-five normozoospermic semen samples were
included in this prospective study. Heavy smokers and
patients who received antioxidants were excluded from
this study. The specimens were obtained from patients
who were referred to the Gandhi IVF clinic for infertility
workups. The abstinence period was 3-5 days. This study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tarbiat Modares
University (IR.MODARES.REC.1397.198). The direct
swim-up method was used to prepare the spermatozoa.
The mean age of men was 33.29 &#x000b1; 3.85.</p></sec><sec><title>Sperm encapsulation into alginate hydrogel</title><p>Sperm containing alginate microcapsules were prepared
according to the previously described method (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
Briefly, 50 &#x003bc;L of sperm solution was mixed with 50 &#x003bc;L
of Quinn`s Advantage Sperm Freeze (SAGE, USA) for
3 minutes which then was added to 100 &#x003bc;L sterilized
alginate solution (1% w/v, sodium alginate, SigmaAldrich, USA). For polymerization, 50-100 &#x000b5;L aqueous
calcium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) with a
concentration of 102 mmol/L was added dropwise to the
as-prepared suspension. After 1 minute, the remaining
unreacted crosslinker was removed through washing with
50 &#x003bc;L of 0.9% w/v sodium chloride. Finally, microcapsules
were transferred into the cryotubes containing 100 &#x003bc;L
cryoprotectant medium containing sodium chloride for 3
minutes before cryopreservation.</p></sec><sec><title>Scanning electron microscopy and <italic>in vitro</italic> sperm release </title><p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the morphology of the prepared
hydrogels without sperm. Samples were first freeze-dried (ALPHA 1-2 LD, UK) overnight
before being sputtered with gold for SEM analysis. Evaluation of the <italic>in
vitro</italic> rate of sperm releasing was also performed using the previously reported
protocol with modification (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This test was done to estimate the <italic>in
vitro</italic> release of spermatozoa after gel encapsulation. For this test, alginate
microcapsules were incubated in four-well plates containing 200 &#x003bc;L of F10 Ham&#x02019;s medium at
37&#x002da;C (n=3). After incubation for 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours, the entire medium was removed and
checked for detection of released spermatozoa. Sperm number was detected by light
microscopy with a Neubauer chamber in at least 5 fields. Three replications were assessed
for each time point. The percentage of spermatozoa released versus time was calculated
using the following formula: </p><p>Percentage of released sperm=(number of spermatozoa
counted in the medium at a specified time/total number of
encapsulated spermatozoa)&#x000d7;100.</p></sec><sec><title>Freezing and thawing sperm</title><p>In this study, the samples were frozen using the rapid
freezing method. As previously described (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), the
samples inside cryotubes were first placed horizontally
3 cm above the surface of liquid nitrogen for 30 minutes
in the nitrogen vapor and then immersed in the liquid
nitrogen. The samples were stored in liquid nitrogen for
at least two weeks. During thawing, the cryotubes were
first placed in a water bath at 35&#x000b0;C for 2 minutes after
removal from the nitrogen tank. In the control group, a
pre-warmed culture medium supplemented with human
serum albumin was added dropwise and centrifugated. In
the alginate group, 150 &#x003bc;L of 119 mM/L sodium citrate
solution (pH=7.5) was added to the cryotube. After 30
seconds, the pre-warmed culture medium supplemented
with human serum albumin was added dropwise. After
that, the samples were centrifugated. After centrifugation
in both groups, the supernatant was removed and the
pellet was used for analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Sperm motility, viability, and morphology
</title><p>Sperm motility was examined according to the WHO
guidelines. In each slide, at least 200 spermatozoa were
evaluated at six microscopic fields. Each sample was
evaluated twice by two different expert technicians and
the mean percent was reported for rates of progressive
and non-progressive motile and immotile spermatozoa
and total sperm motility (progressive+non-progressive).
Sperm viability was measured by evaluating sperm
membrane integrity using the eosin-nigrosin staining
method. The spermatozoa with red/dark pink and white
heads were considered live and dead cells, respectively
(light microscope 1000x). At least 200 cells were assessed
and the rate of sperm viability was reported as percentage.
Papanicolaou staining method was used to evaluate
the sperm morphology. At least 200 spermatozoa were
evaluated reporting morphological abnormalities in the
head, midpiece, and tail percentages (light microscope
1000x) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
</p></sec><sec><title>Acrosome reaction
</title><p>The double staining method was used to evaluate the
acrosome reaction. First, samples were fixed in a 1:1 ratio
with 3% glutaraldehyde for 30 minutes followed by being
centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 minutes. Slides were then
stained with 8% Bismarck Brown for 10 minutes, and
after rinsing, were being stained with 8% Rose Bengal
for 20 minutes. A minimum of 200 spermatozoa was
evaluated and the cells with healthy light brown or pink
acrosome areas were reported as percentages (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DNA denaturation</title><p>Acridine orange staining was used to test denatured
sperm DNA. First, the sperm sample was placed in
Carnoy&#x02019;s fixative solution in a ratio of 3:1 methanol/acetic
acid for 2 hours at 4&#x000b0;C and then stained with acridine
orange for 10 minutes in the dark. Using a fluorescent
microscope, the green spermatozoa were considered
healthy (native), and yellow to red spermatozoa were
considered abnormal (denatured). A minimum of 200
spermatozoa was examined by a fluorescent microscope
(1000x, 460 nm filter) and the rate of spermatozoa with
healthy DNA was reported (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sperm chromatin dispersion</title><p>Sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) was used to evaluate
the DNA integrity using Sperm DNA Fragmentation
Assay [IDEH VARZAN FARDA (IVF Co.), Tehran,
Iran]. First, a 20 &#x000b5;L of sperm suspension (15-20 million
mL-1) was added to 25 &#x000b5;L of low melting agarose. In the
next step, a smear was prepared on a pre-coated glass
slide with 65% agarose and kept in the refrigerator at
4&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. The lysis buffer solution containing
hydrogen chloride (HCl) was then poured on the samples
in the dark for 7 minutes. After washing the lysis buffer,
the slides were immersed in the mercaptoethanol lysing
solution, which separates nucleoproteins, for 15 minutes.
The slides were then rinsed in distilled water for 5
minutes and the dehydration process was performed with
70, 90, and 100% ethanol. After staining with Wright
color, at least 200 spermatozoa were examined for each
sample (light microscope 1000x). According to the size
of the halo around the head of spermatozoa, the degree
of DNA fragmentation was considered. Spermatozoa with
no halo or small halo were considered abnormal, while
spermatozoa with medium or large halo were considered
normal DNA (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).
</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis </title><p>Quantitative data were reported as mean &#x000b1; standard
deviation, median (maximum-minimum). ShapiroWilk test was used to evaluate the distribution of data.
To analyze the data between the three groups before
freezing, alginate, and control, one-way ANOVA with
the Tukey test was used. In cases where the distribution
was not normal, the Kruskal-Wallis test with the
Dunn test was used. The hypothesis was considered
one-tailed and the significance level was considered
P&#x0003c;0.05.

in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Sperm motility was significantly decreased
after thawing compared to before freezing. The rates of
progressive motility and total motility were significantly
lower in the alginate group compared to the control group.
Sperm viability had a significant decrease after thawing
but there was the same in the two groups of control and
alginate. The percentage of sperm normal morphology
after thawing was significantly lower than before
freezing. Additionally, after thawing, sperm morphology
was preserved in the alginate group compared to the
control group, but no significant difference was observed
between the two groups. The cryopreservation induced the
acrosome reaction. However, the rate of spermatozoa with
intact acrosome was significantly higher in the alginate
group compared to the control group. The rate of native
DNA in spermatozoa after thawing was significantly lower than before freezing. This reduction was improved in the
alginate group and a significant difference was observed
between the alginate and control groups. The rate of DNA
fragmentation significantly decreased after thawing. This
reduction improved in the alginate group but there was no
significant difference between the alginate group and the
control group (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Figure 3 shows acridine orange,
acrosome reaction, and SCD tests.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Semen characteristics included in this study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><th colspan="5" rowspan="1">

during cryopreservation. Our results showed that, after thawing, the rate of sperm
progressive motility was significantly lower in the alginate group compared to that of the
control group which was in line with a previous study that used 7 mg/dL alginate to
encapsulate human sperm <italic>in vitro</italic> under slow freezing (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It seems that
one of the factors that decrease sperm motility may be the presence of alginate particles on
the surface of sperm. The cytoskeletal structure of the sperm flagella is composed of
fibrous sheaths which play an active role in sperm motility (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). When the alginate
residue is retained on the sperm, it may impair the active movement of the sperm tail and
reduces motility. Torre et al. encapsulated porcine semen with 0.5% alginate and reported a
decrease in sperm motility due to the remaining residual alginate particles on the sperm
which impaired sperm motility (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In fact, alginate hydrogel may be affected by many
factors such as crosslink concentration, type of alginate, alginate concentration, cell
encapsulation method, and protocol of hydrogel degradation. Each of these factors can affect
sperm motility alone. Moreover, most damages occur rapidly after the thawing stage (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).
During thawing, cryoprotectants inside the cell cannot leave the cell quickly, but water
enters the cell faster leading to osmotic shock causing cell swelling and sperm damage.
Alginate, which acts as a matrix around the spermatozoa and protects the sperm membrane, is
removed during thawing. </p><p>According to the results of the present study, the sperm viability was the same between the
alginate and control groups. As mentioned earlier, alginate is a biodegradable polymer with
high biocompatibility, with a prominent potential to form a three-dimensional matrix around
the cell similar to the extracellular matrix. This type of porous matrix can maintain the
desired level of cell viability in any <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in
vivo</italic> environment (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Alginate creates a unique structure that facilitates the
transport of signaling molecules and nutrients. It was shown that poly (propylene
fumarate)-co-alginate resists the penetration of ROS (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). However, according to Pirnia et
al., spermatogonia stem cell viability in the alginatecontaining group was significantly
reduced compared to the control group. According to this study, the probable cause of the
decrease in viability is in the thawing step after removing alginate hydrogel and exposure
to ROS (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In addition, Kumar et al. (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), supplemented semen extender of buffalo with
alginate and cryopreserved the samples with a programmable biological freezer. They showed
that alginate maintains membrane integrity and increases sperm viability.</p><p>Regarding sperm morphology, the rate of normal sperm
morphology in the alginate group was similar to the control
group. Osmotic stress may affect sperm morphology.
Permeable cryoprotectant agents must penetrate the cell
to play protective roles and this addition before freezing
and removal in the thawing step causes severe osmotic
volume changes, which in turn may cause cell injury (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).
These rapid changes in cell osmolality have caused the
shape and structure of the sperm membrane to change
especially in the form of deformities in the sperm head
and the twisting of the sperm tail. According to Torre et
al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) the percentage of porcine sperm morphological
abnormalities in both encapsulated and control groups was
not significantly different concluding that the presence of
sperm morphological abnormalities does not depend on
the storage process in the alginate.</p><p>Based on our results, the acrosome reaction rate after
the freeze-thawing process was significantly decreased in
the alginate group compared to that of the control group.
During the cryopreservation, due to temperature changes
and increased ROS, the structure of polyunsaturated
fatty acids and cholesterol is disrupted, which in turn
increases the membrane&#x02019;s permeability to calcium and
ROS, subsequently activating phospholipase A2, leading
to the onset of an acrosome reaction (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). It was shown
that adding sodium alginate to the cryopreservation
medium prevents sperm membrane changes and maintains
membrane integrity, which in turn preserves the acrosome
membrane and prevents premature acrosome reaction (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Our data showed that acridine orange and SCD results were not in line with each other in
the alginate group. In the group containing alginate, the rate of DNA denaturation and DNA
fragmentation decreased compared to the control group, which significantly differed in DNA
denaturation. It was shown that there was a lack of relationship between SCD and acridine
orange (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The cut-off value of acridine orange (native DNA) is greater than 50% (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) and
all groups in our study had native DNA greater than the cut-off value. It suggested that
acridine orange is reliable when there is a high level of DNA damage (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Two important
factors of DNA fragmentation and DNA damage are oxidative stress and apoptosis (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In
fact, the increase in ROS production during cryopreservation is the cause of oxidative
stress leading to DNA fragmentation. In the thawing step, various factors such as
temperature, osmotic stress, and the use of centrifuges cause defects in the sperm
mitochondrial membrane and ROS production (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Removing alginate at the thawing step makes
the spermatozoa more prone to oxidative stress compared with the control group. According to
Pirnia et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), the use of 1% alginate hydrogel for encapsulation of spermatogonia stem
cells can regulate the differentiation of these cells and maintain their pluripotency of
them during slow freezing by regulating <italic>Lin28a</italic> and <italic>Sall14
</italic>genes. The potential role of encapsulation is to maintain sperm viability while
allowing their gradual release (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Our data showed that <italic>in vitro</italic> sperm
release was very low and the corresponding value reached constant within 24 hours confirming
the stability of the hydrogel structure in F10 Ham&#x02019;s medium over time (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).
Microencapsulation of semen has been suggested as a method of choice for a gradual release
of spermatozoa within the female reproductive or extended storage (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The latter was
regarded in this study. Here, we did not observe the fast release and the total <italic>in
vitro</italic> sperm release was very low. We do not expect many releases after effective
crosslinking of the hydrogel as the calcium chloride is making links between the alginate
branches. This observation confirms the great integrity of the prepared hydrogels preventing
the burst effect of the sperm release. We also achieved gradual release which further
approves the stability of the hydrogel structure. More importantly, different parameters
including concentrations of calcium ions for making the capsules could affect gel strength
and thickness of the alginate membrane which in turn impacts the spermatozoa release
behavior (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Further studies are required to evaluate the effect of sperm species,
alginate type, and the crosslinkers as well as their concentration for optimal sperm
release. In this study, we evaluated the impact of alginate encapsulation on normozoospermic
samples. It should be noted that pre-cryo sperm parameters including motility and viability
are useful to predict post-thaw outcomes (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). It is suggested to evaluate the probable
effects of alginate encapsulation on abnormal sperm samples in the next research. </p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>According to the results of this study, alginate can

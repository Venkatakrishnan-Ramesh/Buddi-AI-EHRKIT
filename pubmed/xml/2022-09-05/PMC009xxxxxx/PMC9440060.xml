Myofibrillar protein (MPs) are predominant among muscle proteins, and account for approximately 50&#x000a0;% of the total protein content <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Benefiting from their fibrous flexible structure and abundant side-chain functional groups with high surface activity <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, MPs have great potential as special nutritional ingredients for application in liquid foods. Once successful, the emergence of MP-based beverages or soft foods can meet the meat protein needs of the elderly, infants, and dysphagic patients. Nevertheless, due to their poor solubility in water or low-ionic strength media, MPs have not been utilized as much as plant-derived proteins. Although MPs can be adequately solubilized in a highly concentrated salt solution (0.47&#x02013;0.68&#x000a0;M NaCl), this is not recommended for a healthy diet <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. It is thus necessary to explore strategies for improving the solubility of MPs in low-ionic strength media.</p><p id="p0035">The molecular behavior of myosin (one of the main proteins among MPs) in low-salt media is considered responsible for the poor water solubility of MPs <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In low-salt media, monomeric myosin regularly assembles into insoluble filamentous polymers (termed myosin filaments) <italic>via</italic> electrostatic interactions in rod regions, thereby resulting in poor solubility of MPs <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. To solve this problem, many attempts, including physical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments, have been made to suppress the assembly of myosin filaments in low-ionic strength media <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p id="p0040">One promising strategy to improve the functional properties of proteins is the direct conjugation with a hydrophilic polymer <italic>via</italic> glycation, which is carried out in mild and safe conditions without any extraneous chemicals <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The solubilization effect of glycation was initially attributed to the grafting of hydrophilic residues and the shift of the protein isoelectric point <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, while its effect on the assembly process of myosin molecules in food processing media of low ionic strength has rarely been mentioned. The role of glycation in interfering with the assembly of myosin into filaments is well documented in the field of biomedicine. The changes in myosin behavior due to nonenzymatic glycation <italic>in vivo</italic> have been suggested to play a major role in diabetes and aging-related muscle degenerative diseases <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A reduced rate of muscle contraction resulting from the suppression of myosin assembly is one of the main causes of this condition <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, few studies have addressed this topic in food systems. Hence, in this study we aimed to test the hypothesis that glycosyl units may serve as interference factors to suppress the self-assembly of myosin molecules in food systems with low ionic strength.</p><p id="p0045">In a recent study, Li et al. <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> reported that approximately 75&#x000a0;% of rabbit MPs could dissolve effectively in a low-ionic strength medium <italic>via</italic> glycation under dry-heating conditions (52.4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 23.1&#x000a0;h); however, the shortcomings of this method are that it involves time-consuming procedures and requires precise temperature control. In our previous work <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, we found that the solubility of MPs in water was significantly improved by glycation with dextran (DX) under wet-heating conditions (37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, 8&#x000a0;h), which resulted in the solubility of the glycated MPs to reach approximately 50&#x000a0;%. However, it should be noted that the solubility of glycated MPs is still far from complete, due to the low grafting efficiency of traditional wet-heating glycation. On the one hand, the polymeric structure of filamentous myosin limits exposure to most of the active binding sites; on the other hand, most of the non-disaggregated myosin filaments remain in an insoluble state. Thus, ideal techniques should be applied to enhance the efficiency of glycation.</p><p id="p0050">High-intensity ultrasound (HIU) shows great potential in promoting the glycation reaction. The cavitation effect of HIU can increase the flexibility of proteins, which enables the grafting of hydrophilic groups onto the protein molecules <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Our previous research showed that the physical force exerted by HIU can disrupt the filamentous myosin structure, thus exposing the internal reactive groups on the myosin surface <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the subsequent assembly of myosin molecules is still inevitable. An interesting hypothesis is that the destruction of the myosin filament induced by HIU, combined with the suppressing effect of glycation on the myosin assembly process, could further improve the water solubility of MPs. Furthermore, some studies have found that HIU can affect the glycation of proteins, although the conclusions of different investigations were largely inconsistent. It was reported that HIU increased the glycation reaction rate and significantly improved the solubility and foamability of ovalbumin <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In contrast, HIU pretreatment was found to induce the aggregation of &#x003b2;-lactoglobulin, partially burying glycation sites <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Hence, investigating the enhancement effect of different ultrasonic parameters on the glycation reaction is a highly important task.</p><p id="p0055">Dextran (DX) is a flexible polysaccharide with high solubility and poor aggregation ability <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Compared to glycated proteins with small carbohydrate molecules, the polysaccharides provide strong steric hindrance and low reducibility, preventing excessive color development and protein polymerization <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In the present work, the effect of HIU pretreatment on the glycation reaction between MPs and DX was compared with that of the traditional wet-heating method. Moreover, we determined the solubility, structural characteristics, and filament-forming ability of the treated MPs. The objective was to verify the hypothesis discussed above and apply the obtained insights to expand the applications of MPs in food processing media of low ionic strength as well as hydrophilic and colloidal food systems.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Materials</title><p id="p0060">Fresh porcine longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle was collected at 24&#x000a0;h post-mortem from a local supermarket (Harbin, Heilongjiang, China).

The amide I and amide II peaks of glycated MPs exhibited an increasing trend, which was attributed to the glycation reaction, because this process involves the formation of new compounds (C<private-char name="E00C" description="bond, double bond"><glyph-ref glyph-data="pc-E00C" /></private-char>N, C<private-char name="E00C" description="bond, double bond"><glyph-ref glyph-data="pc-E00C" /></private-char>O, C&#x02014;N) <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

These results show that the DX molecules were covalently bonded to the MPs.

As expected, the solubility of the native MPs in water was relatively low (3.7&#x000a0;%). This was consistent with previous reports; the adjacent myosin monomers tend to form self-assembled filamentous polymers in low-ionic strength media, which make it insoluble and unstable <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. After glycation with DX, the solubility of MPs showed a significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) increase to 50.62&#x000a0;% (MP-DX). This improvement may be attributed to the incorporation of more hydrophilic groups, facilitating the protein&#x02013;water interaction, and to the grafting of DX, which suppressed the formation of filamentous myosin <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It is interesting to observe that HIU pretreatment further improved the solubility of glycated MPs. According to Liu et al. <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, the intense physical forces generate by ultrasound lead to the depolymerization of filamentous polymers, thereby improving the solubility of MPs in water. Consequently, we speculate that the HIU pretreatment may expose more reactive sites that were originally located inside the filamentous polymeric structure, increasing the subsequent glycation degree of the protein; in this way, the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance caused by the grafted DX would effectively hinder the polymer formation. Notably, UMP-DX-400 showed the highest solubility (78.21&#x000a0;%), which was attributed to the fact that the higher DG provided better solubility, in agreement with the results of the DG analysis. However, with the ultrasound power was further increased to 500&#x000a0;W, the solubility of glycated MPs decreased significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), likely due to the relatively high ultrasound power causing a reaggregation of protein particles <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Correspondingly, the aggregation of proteins could bury a fraction of the glycation sites inside the aggregates, which may reduce their accessibility to polysaccharide molecules in the subsequent glycation reaction.<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Changes in solubility of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) in water (A) and appearance of MP solutions (B) after different treatments.

As shown in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A, in which green fluorescence areas represent the proteins, several intact and linear structures with relatively large particle size were observed in the native MP sample, which were attributed to the self-assembly of myosin, consistent with our previous report <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.

These results suggest that the introduction of the glycosyl units could suppress the formation of ordered filamentous myosin structures to a certain extent, thus reducing the particle size of MPs. This could be attributed to the changes in surface hydrophobicity, electrostatic interactions, and steric hindrance induced by glycation <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

The most uniform distribution and smallest particle size were observed for the UMP-DX-400 conjugate (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), probably because it exhibited the highest grafting degree, causing a larger steric hindrance and suppressing self-assembly to the largest extent. Notably, the UMP-DX-500 conjugate showed a marked increase in particle size, and a large peak appeared in the corresponding distribution, which may be due to the &#x0201c;over-processing&#x0201d; effect at higher power leading to protein reaggregation <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) micrographs (A), particle distribution (B), average particle size (C), and zeta potential (D) of aqueous suspensions of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) subjected to different treatments.

Interestingly, the intensity of the large- and small-particle peaks appeared to decrease and increase, respectively, in the glycated MP samples, particularly in the UMP-DX-400 conjugate. The small-particle peak was ascribed to oligomer or monomer species in the MPs, whereas the large-particle one was probably due to the filamentous myosin polymers <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In general, the formation of filamentous myosin polymers in low-ionic strength media are mediated by charged clusters periodically distributed in the bipolar tail of myosin <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It is therefore reasonable to speculate that the introduction of polysaccharide units interferes with the assembly of myosin molecules and suppresses the formation of filamentous myosin polymers, causing a decrease in the peak area corresponding to large particles. Furthermore, the present results suggest the occurrence of a moderate synergistic effect between HIU and glycosylation, and the MPs subjected to the combination of the two treatments showed a smaller particle size and a more uniform distribution (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B, C). However, no further increase in the small-particle peak was observed when the HIU power increased to 500&#x000a0;W. On the contrary, the peak area corresponding to the large particles increased, which could be attributed to the aggregation of protein particles, as discussed in section 3.1.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><label>3.5</label><title>Zeta potential analysis</title><p id="p0180">The zeta potential is an important parameter reflecting the stability of MPs, which can be used to characterize the dispersion or aggregation of protein particles <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. As shown in <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D, all MP suspensions exhibited a net negative charge, because of the deprotonation of amino acids contained in the MPs at neutral pH <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Notably, the MP-DX samples possessed a significantly higher net negative charge than the native MPs (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). This was consistent with a previous study reporting that the net negative charge of whey proteins increased after glycation <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The increased negative charge can be attributed to the introduction of negatively charged sugar units and the consumption of positively charged lysine after glycation, resulting in a more negative charge on the particle surface. After the combined treatment, the net negative charge of glycated MP samples showed a further increase. The highest zeta potential value (&#x02212;24.68&#x000a0;mV) was obtained for glycated MP samples pretreated by 400&#x000a0;W ultrasound (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), in agreement with the results of particle size (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). A reasonable interpretation of this result is that HIU pretreatment induced the dissociation of myosin filaments and the unfolding of proteins, culminating in the exposure of more charged residues and glycation sites, whose combination promoted the observed increase in negative charge <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p id="p0185">The myosin contained in MPs is characterized by bipolar rod domains that, driven by electrostatic interactions, tend to stack up against each other, assemble in a regular fashion, and eventually form filamentous polymers in low-ionic strength media <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Changes in the MP charge thus reflect a broken electrostatic balance between myosin rods, suppressing the self-assembly of myosin. The higher negative zeta potential of the UMP-DX-400 conjugate indicates a stronger electrostatic repulsion, which is expected to effectively suppress the molecular assembly behavior of myosin by hindering rod&#x02013;rod electrostatic interactions <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. As a result, the UMP-DX-400 conjugate had a more uniform particle size distribution and higher solubility in water (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><label>3.6</label><title>Changes in the secondary structure of MPs</title><p id="p0190">The above results indicate that HIU pretreatment can promote the subsequent glycation reaction and further improve the dispersion stability of MPs, which may be related to the depolymerization of filamentous polymers and the unfolding of the protein structure. Further analysis focused on determining the effect of the combination of HIU pretreatment with glycation on the conformation of MPs. The secondary structure of the protein was assessed using CD spectroscopy (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A). The CD spectrum of MPs displayed two negative bands corresponding to the &#x003b1;-helix structure near 208 and 222&#x000a0;nm, reflecting the predominance of the &#x003b1;-helix structure of myosin rods <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Obviously, the intense negative troughs of each of these two peaks were present in the native MPs, due to the superhelix conformation formed by the aggregation of myosin rods, and indicating the presence of many myosin filaments in the aqueous MP suspension <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. After glycation, varying degrees of intensity attenuation of the peaks at 208 and 222&#x000a0;nm were observed in the CD spectrum; this effect was more pronounced after ultrasound pretreatment, denoting significant disruption and loss of the helical structure of filamentous myosin <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

In general, the &#x003b1;-helix structure is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen (&#x02013;CO) and amino hydrogen (NH&#x02013;) of single polypeptide chains, while the &#x003b2;-sheet structure is supported by hydrogen bonds between peptide chains <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, the decrease in the &#x003b1;-helix and &#x003b2;-sheet contents revealed that the grafting of polysaccharides induced protein unfolding and denaturation, possibly disrupting both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds and consequently altering the secondary structure of the protein. The samples in the combined treatment groups (UMP-DX) showed more extensive changes in the secondary structure of MPs than those in the individual treatment groups (MP-DX). This may be attributed to the intense physical force induced by sonic cavitation, which destroyed the protein&#x02013;protein interactions, resulting in the dissociation of more hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the glycation reaction might introduce complex groups into the hydrogen bonding sites of protein molecules, and ultrasound pretreatment further enhanced this phenomenon. In addition, the steric hindrance caused by the grafted DX could further shield the intermolecular hydrogen bonds <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, a further increase in ultrasound power to 500&#x000a0;W resulted in a significant increase in &#x003b1;-helix and &#x003b2;-sheet contents, at the expense of the &#x003b2;-turn and random coil contents (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).

In this study, the fluorescence intensity of MP-DX samples was lower than that of the native MP samples (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C), indicating that the protein structure stretched and unfolded after glycation, which exposed tryptophan residues previously buried in the hydrophobic inner regions of the protein. The HIU pretreatment, especially at 400&#x000a0;W power, led to a further reduction in fluorescence intensity, indicating further protein unfolding and DX grafting onto MPs. On the other hand, as a water-soluble polysaccharide, the presence of DX would enhance the polar environment and partially shield the fluorescence signal. In addition, the maximum emission wavelength (<italic>&#x003bb;</italic><sub>m</sub>) of the native MPs was 331.0&#x000a0;nm, while MP-DX, UMP-DX-200, UMP-DX-300, UMP-DX-400, and UMP-DX-500 were red-shifted to 332.4, 332.8, 334.2, 336.4, and 333.6&#x000a0;nm, respectively.

This aspect was consistent with the zeta potential results and further supported the solubility analysis. It should be noted that the surface hydrophobicity of glycated MPs pretreated by ultrasound was markedly lower than that of MPs subjected only to glycation. Moreover, the surface hydrophobicity of glycated MPs gradually decreased with increasing ultrasonic power.

The MP salt solution (0.6&#x000a0;M NaCl) was dialyzed against 0.3&#x000a0;M and 1&#x000a0;mM NaCl solutions. Different uppercase (A&#x02013;C) and lowercase (a&#x02013;c) letters indicate significant differences in solubility and turbidity, respectively, after different treatments (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig></p><p id="p0220">Finally, the microscopic morphology of MPs in solutions of different ionic strength was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Before dialysis, the native MP, MP-DX, and UMP-DX-400 samples were predominantly present as monomers in high-salt solutions (0.6&#x000a0;M NaCl) <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. As the NaCl concentration decreased from 0.6&#x000a0;M to 1&#x000a0;mM, the native MP monomers polymerized and eventually formed highly ordered filamentous polymers, confirming that in low-ionic strength media the myosin in the native MPs would assemble into myosin filaments <italic>via</italic> rod&#x02013;rod electrostatic interactions <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Notably, MP-DX displayed a more dispersed microstructure in 0.3&#x000a0;M NaCl solution, while some shortened, disordered, and irregular filamentous polymers were observed in 1&#x000a0;mM NaCl solutions; this suggested that the glycation suppressed the formation of integrated filament structures, forming some small filamentous fragments instead. Interestingly, no filamentous polymers were observed in the UMP-DX-400 samples at both 0.3&#x000a0;M and 1&#x000a0;mM NaCl concentrations. Some myosin monomers, as well as their dimers and oligomers, were clearly identified in 1&#x000a0;mM NaCl solution, in good agreement with previous results based on particle size and CLSM measurements (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). These observations confirmed that the combination of HIU pretreatment and glycation could improve the solubility of MPs by destroying or suppressing the assembly of myosin filaments at low ionic strength.<fig id="f0030"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the native MPs (MP), glycated MPs (MP-DX), and glycated MPs pretreated with high-intensity ultrasound at 400&#x000a0;W (UMP-DX-400) during dialysis.

Myosin is at the center of this mechanism, as the main protein in MPs and thus responsible for their solubility. According to previous studies, myosin has a rod-like structure, with two spherical head regions and a tail region consisting of a coiled helix <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Native myosin is usually polymerized in low-salt media to form insoluble filamentous polymers (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and 6) with large particle size (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A) and low absolute zeta potential (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). After glycation, the net negative charge (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B) and electrostatic repulsion increases, due to the covalent binding of positively charged lysine residues of the protein with dextran (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, B). As a result, the electrostatic balance of the myosin tail is broken, and the assembly process of filamentous polymers is disrupted (<xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A and 6), which improves the solubility of MPs in water (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). After HIU pretreatment, the grafting degree of the glycated MPs increases (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). This is because HIU pretreatment destroys the filamentous polymerization structure, induces protein unfolding, and exposes more residues and glycation sites. Under this condition, ultrasound combined with glycation can provide a stronger electrostatic repulsion to suppress filament assembly at low ionic strength (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In addition, the grafting of more hydrophilic residues can provide a stronger steric hindrance, which may effectively prevent subsequent aggregation of MPs. Thus, the combination of HIU pretreatment with glycation further improves the solubility and stability of MPs in water.<fig id="f0035"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism for solubilization of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) in water by high-intensity ultrasound pretreatment combined with glycation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s0150"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0230">In conclusion, HIU pretreatment promoted the subsequent glycation between MPs and DX. The HIU pretreatment, especially at 400&#x000a0;W power, significantly improved the solubility of glycated MPs in water, as evidenced by their increased grafting degree, reduced particle size, and more uniform size distribution. In particular, the 400&#x000a0;W ultrasound pretreatment significantly increased the net charge of glycated MPs. The stronger inter/intramolecular electrostatic repulsion was responsible for the loss of &#x003b1;-helix structures and the suppress of myosin filament formation in low-salt media. In addition, the steric hindrance produced by the grafted polysaccharides would destroy existing filamentous myosin aggregates and hinder further aggregate formation, resulting in the solubilization of MPs. Overall, the covalent bonding of MPs with DX through ultrasound pretreatment combined with glycation might be a promising method to improve the water solubility of MPs; this approach opens a new avenue for the development of muscle protein-based products with desirable properties.</p></sec><sec id="s0155"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0235"><bold>Ge Han:</bold> Data curation, Writing &#x02013; original draft. <bold>Yuexin Li:</bold> Investigation, Formal analysis. <bold>Qian Liu:</bold> Data curation. <bold>Qian Chen:</bold> Software, Resources. <bold>Haotian Liu:</bold> Conceptualization, Visualization, Supervision. <bold>Baohua Kong:</bold> Conceptualization, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Methodology, Funding acquisition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0240">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Solangi</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zan</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effects of sodium hexametaphosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium pyrophosphate on the ultrastructure of beef myofibrillar proteins investigated with atomic force microscopy</article-title><source>Food Chem.</source><volume>338</volume><year>2021</year><fpage>128146</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">33091990</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Z.</given-names></name><name><surname>Badar</surname><given-names>I.H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Q.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Q.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Combination of high-intensity ultrasound and hydrogen peroxide treatment suppresses thermal aggregation behaviour of myofibrillar protein in water</article-title><source>Food Chem.</source><volume>367</volume><year>2022</year><fpage>130756</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">34388633</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b0015"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>X.</given-names></name><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Q.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Water-soluble myofibrillar protein-pectin complex for enhanced physical stability near the isoelectric point: Fabrication, rheology and thermal property</article-title><source>Int.

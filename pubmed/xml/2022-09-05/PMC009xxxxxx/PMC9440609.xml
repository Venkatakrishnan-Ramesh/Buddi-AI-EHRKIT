Inclusion criteria consisted of a clinical diagnosis of corneal endothelial dystrophy/degeneration by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist or resident and a supporting description of corneal edema as part of the ophthalmic examination. Patients were excluded if they had a history of intraocular surgery, chronic anterior uveitis, glaucoma, anterior lens luxation, and/or glaucoma. Because all control dogs demonstrated at least one eye with corneal edema as part of the inclusion criteria, dogs in the ripasudil treatment group with bilaterally compensated disease (lacking corneal edema bilaterally) were excluded from this analysis. Based on the gathered information from the medical records, each ripasudil-treated eye was matched with an eye from the retrospective study with similar age, breed/size, and severity corneal edema at baseline to include in comparative analysis. Controls were selected based on signalment and baseline disease stage alone without knowledge of progression at the time of selection. Ripasudil-treated and control eyes were further classified using the previously described corneal edema progression criteria by Leonard et al.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Progression criteria were described as follows: &#x0201c;Criterion 1: Eyes recorded as having clear (non-edematous) corneas during the first visit, but showed signs of CED in the contralateral globe, subsequently progressing to any degree of corneal edema in the unaffected globe at later visits. Criterion 2: Eyes recorded as having mild corneal edema during the first visit and subsequently progressing to severe corneal edema at later visits. Criterion 3: Eyes recorded as having focal corneal edema during the first visit and subsequently progressing to diffuse corneal edema in later visits.&#x0201d; Kaplan-Meier curves were generated to demonstrate time to corneal edema progression for each group, defined as the time from initial examination to when an eye met any of the three progression criteria.

The study population consisted of four Boston terriers, one Jack Russell terrier, one Australian terrier, one keeshond, one West Highland white terrier, and four small mixed breed dogs. The three eyes not included in the study were enucleated prior to enrollment. Age at enrollment ranged from 4 to 13 years with a mean age of 10 years. Five dogs, the Boston terriers and Jack Russell terrier, were presumed to have corneal endothelial dystrophy based on breed and age of onset, whereas the remaining seven dogs were diagnosed with age-related endothelial degeneration. Eleven eyes were characterized as having mild disease at baseline, and 10 eyes were characterized as having moderate to severe disease at baseline based on the extent of corneal edema. Nine eyes of seven dogs concurrently received topical hypertonic saline ointment (Muro 128, Sodium chloride hypertonicity ophthalmic ointment 5%, Bausch &#x00026; Lomb Incorporated, Laval, Quebec, Canada) during the treatment period.

Eyes classified as having mild disease at baseline were more likely to exhibit favorable outcomes than more severely affected eyes. Specifically, mildly versus severely affected eyes demonstrated improvement in 36% and 10% of eyes, respectively. Although 40% of severely affected eyes demonstrated stable disease in comparison to 36% of mildly affected eyes, this outcome is considered less favorable in severely affected eyes as vision and comfort are often already compromised at advanced stages of disease. Therefore, this study suggests a potential benefit of ripasudil in early disease, as supported by findings in previous studies of human patients with FECD.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p><p>Whereas statistically significant progression of central corneal thickness was found with USP measurements, a previous study demonstrated that manual FD-OCT measurements demonstrate less variability than USP measurements of corneal thickness in eyes with corneal disease.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Therefore, the relevance of the statistically significant difference in corneal thickness by USP when no significant differences were identified using FD-OCT should not be overstated.</p><p>A retrospective study by Leonard et al. documented disease progression in CED-affected dogs based on the extent and severity of corneal edema over time.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Using the same progression criteria applied to eyes in the current study, we demonstrated a statistically significant difference in corneal edema progression with and without ripasudil therapy. Eyes receiving topical ripasudil demonstrated less edema progression over time, further supporting a potential therapeutic benefit. Although several eyes treated with topical ripasudil still progressed, ripasudil may offer a nonsurgical option to stabilize or prolong disease progression in patients with endothelial degeneration.</p><p>This study investigates the use of a topical ROCK inhibitor without disruption of the existing corneal endothelium. However, ROCK inhibitors have more routinely been used as an adjunctive or rescue therapy after surgical disruption of the corneal DM-endothelium complex through DSO in human patients.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Previous studies have shown favorable responses to ripasudil following DSO with improved endothelial cell densities in ripasudil-treated eyes compared to those who underwent DSO without ripasudil therapy.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Excision of abnormal endothelial cells and the associated Descemet's membrane is thought to allow for peripheral endothelial cells to proliferate and migrate to restore corneal deturgescence.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Alleviation of contact-inhibition through physical denudation of the corneal endothelium may enhance the benefit of ROCK inhibition. The clinical benefit observed with ripasudil without endothelial disruption in the current study may be related to reduction of endothelial cell apoptosis or improved endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion following loss of endothelial cells, as have been seen in vitro and in ex vivo tissue models.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Future studies may investigate the use of ROCK inhibitors in PCED-affected dogs following corneal endothelial denudation with or without the injection of cultured endothelial cells. As graft-sparing and cell-based therapies for endothelial dysfunction continue to gain traction, further investigation of ROCK inhibition as an adjuvant to these techniques is warranted.</p><p>There were several limitations to this study that should be considered. First, this was an open-label trial without a placebo control group. Spontaneous improvement in dogs with PCED has not previously been reported. Thus, any improvement in corneal thickness, corneal edema, or corneal ECD was attributed to the administered treatment. To account for the lack of a placebo control group, additional Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses were performed to compare disease progression of ripasudil-treated eyes to age- and breed/size-matched historical controls from a previously published retrospective study using the same progression criteria. Admittedly, the inclusion criteria of the current study differed from the retrospective study, as advanced imaging was included in confirming the diagnosis of PCED prior to initiating ripasudil therapy. Therefore, dogs that would be excluded based on the inclusion criteria of the retrospective study (i.e. dogs with bilateral compensated disease) were excluded from this additional analysis.</p><p>One theoretical confounding factor was the use of topical hypertonic saline in some eyes with corneal edema. However, a previous study demonstrated only a 2% to 4% decrease in corneal thickness following the application of hypertonic saline ointment in healthy dogs,<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> whereas we used a cutoff of 20% to denote clinically significant improvement or progression of corneal thickness. Additionally, only one of the five eyes that improved during the treatment period received hypertonic saline, and seven of nine eyes that received hypertonic saline progressed during the treatment period. This suggests that the administration of topical hypertonic saline alone cannot account for the favorable responses encountered in a subset of eyes.</p><p>Dogs with marked variation in disease stage at baseline were enrolled, and sample sizes were relatively small, which reduced statistical power. To address variation in disease stage and progression, affected eyes were considered individually using clinical response criteria. The underlying cause of corneal degeneration differed between enrolled dogs, with some dogs, such as Boston terriers, presumably having heritable corneal endothelial dystrophy whereas others demonstrated age-related corneal degeneration. It is possible that the etiology of endothelial degeneration may affect response to therapy, although subgroup analysis could not be performed due to the small sample size in each group. Future randomized, controlled, and double-blind studies with stricter inclusion criteria to limit the variation in disease stage and underlying cause of corneal degeneration are warranted.</p><p>Topical ripasudil was well-tolerated in PCED-affected dogs with conjunctival hyperemia being the most common adverse event observed, consistent with previous tolerability studies.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> An additional adverse event was the development of reticular bullous epithelial edema, which has also been reported in a series of human patients receiving the topical ROCK inhibitor netarsudil.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> However, unlike in human patients, the reticular bullous epithelial edema was transient in these dogs and resolved without discontinuation of ripasudil as this change was appreciated at some visits but not all. The cause of reticular bullous epithelial edema remains unknown but may involve ROCK-inhibitor induced disruption of actin cytoskeleton organization and tight junctions of corneal epithelial cells.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> The disappearance of the bullae without cessation of ripasudil may indicate that the edema was present as a result of the underlying disease rather than an adverse drug event, that the adverse event was truly transient or occurred only shortly after administration, or that topical hypertonic saline ointment may have aided in resolution of the bullae. Corneal stromal hemorrhage is a rare occurrence reported in humans receiving ROCK inhibitors, including a case report of a 76-year-old man with pre-existing peripheral corneal neovascularization and concurrent primary open angle glaucoma treated with topical netarsudil.<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Interestingly, both dogs that demonstrated corneal stromal hemorrhage also had pre-existing corneal neovascularization as seen in image C of&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. One of the dogs that experienced corneal stromal hemorrhage also had diabetes mellitus, which has been shown to increase vascular permeability.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> It is suspected that conjunctival hyperemia occurs due to ROCK inhibitor-induced vascular smooth muscle relaxation and modulation in vascular endothelial cells.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> We hypothesize that blood vessels in the cornea undergo similar changes in vascular permeability with ROCK inhibition, predisposing to corneal hemorrhage. Therefore, the use of ROCK inhibitors in patients with underlying corneal vascularization or concurrent conditions resulting in increased vascular permeability should be avoided. Finally, no difference in IOP was found across time points, consistent with previous studies showing lack of clinically significant IOP reduction with netarsudil in normotensive dogs<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> and in dogs with primary open angle glaucoma.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref></p><p>In summary, eyes with PCED demonstrated variable responses to therapy, though overall, eyes treated with topical ripasudil demonstrated less corneal edema progression than untreated historical controls. Additionally, eyes with mild disease showed more favorable responses to ripasudil therapy, suggesting a potential benefit in dogs with early PCED without significant decompensation. Stage of disease at baseline was one factor found to be associated with a positive outcome, but additional investigation is necessary to determine other factors that may be predictive of an individual's response. This open-label pilot study serves as a guide for the development of future clinical trials evaluating the use of ROCK inhibitors in canine disease models of corneal endothelial degeneration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Monica Motta, Megan Gragg, Carina Pasqualino, and Michelle McCorkell for assisting with the patient examinations and David Maggs, Steven Hollingsworth, Andrea Minella, Kelly Knickelbein, and Kirsten Steele for case referral.</p><p>Supported by the National Institutes of Health R01EY016134, P30EY12576, and K08EY028199, the Center for Companion Animal Health at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, and the Jane Lin Fong Ophthalmic Clinical Trial Support Fund.</p><p content-type="COI-statement">Disclosure: <bold>S.R.

Furthermore, because of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) restrictions by the host immune system, therapies with cells from human donors are restricted to auto-transplantation of, eg, stem cells from wounded patients. Human cell therapy with universally applicable donor tissue does not yet exist.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>A common medical problem is impaired healing of skin wounds, resulting in chronic, nonhealing wounds. For example, aging populations are increasing in numbers, resulting in increased numbers of patients with pressure (or decubitus) sores. In Europe and the US, elderly with decubitus wounds represent cohorts of millions of often hospitalized patients. The estimated prize of pressure sore treatment amounts to an annual recurrent cost of more than 10 billion dollars in the US alone.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Aside pressure ulcers, common in immobilized elderly, diabetic foot ulcers, burns, traumata, impaired healing after radiotherapy, vascular insults (eg, venous thrombosis) and infections create necrotic wounds in urgent need of better treatments. As an alternative to the time-consuming and costly cell therapies, the application of various growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other cytokines have been probed with limited success. A possible explanation is the insight that the natural healing process of acute wounds is fine-tuned in time and space. In addition, with single host cell types or molecules it is impossible to mimic the synchronized healing process, involving multiple cell types, or to force it towards physiological healing with its sequential appearance and disappearance of specific leukocyte types.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Solutions to advance our knowledge are (i) definition of locoregional and temporal cellular changes and molecular expression levels, and (ii) testing and modifying various pharmacological agents to efficiently aid wound healing.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Histologically, sterile acute skin wounds, for instance after skin abrasion or excision for skin transplantation purposes, develop a rich dermal granulation reaction. In addition, such wounds are wet, rather than dry and, at the edges, keratinocytes grow as to fill the epithelial layers. Some of these processes in acute wounds are comparable to those of severe inflammatory reactions or skin infections.</p><p>Intact skin is a perfect antimicrobial barrier against bacteria and viruses and is, at the external side, inhabited by the so-called skin microbiome. When the skin as an integument is broken and the wound is not properly disinfected and treated, infection is imminent, in particular with common papillomaviruses causing warts and with bacterial species including <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains. Skin infections need to be avoided, as these impair the healing process and contribute to the development of chronic wounds.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The most frequently encountered bacteria in skin infections are <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains including the methicillin resistant variant &#x02500; MRSA.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Other bacteria mostly related to skin infections are <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter</italic> spp., and coagulase-negative staphylococci such as <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Antibiotic resistance is a crucial problem in the management and treatment of infected wounds.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, the interest in the search and development for alternative antimicrobial agents, including capped nanocomposites and platelet-rich plasma, acting also on resistant bacterial strains has recently been significantly increased.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> Antimicrobial properties of several polysaccharides from bacteria and fungi have been studied. Two major targets of their action that have been pointed out in recent literature are biofilm formation and membrane integrity of microbes.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> As discussed later for comparison, polymers, hydrogels and other scaffolds may possess intrinsic antibacterial activities.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>We have previously studied the antiviral mechanism of action of a chemically modified polysaccharide-derivative, chlorite-oxidized oxyamylose (COAM) against lethal mengovirus in mice. This antiviral agent was demonstrated to recruit myeloid cells through binding of granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2/CXCL6).<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Next, we demonstrated that COAM acted as a mimetic of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and exposed chemokines more efficiently, due to its higher affinities towards the chemokines than those of GAGs. Remarkably, the exposed chemokines remained functionally active and, thereby, COAM may direct cells to specific body compartments.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Within the context of skin inflammation, leukocyte recruitment by COAM has already been studied in the mouse air pouch model.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> After 24 h, COAM dose-dependently induced maximal local neutrophilia (60% of infiltrated leukocytes) and a relative decrease in mononuclear cell numbers, both macrophages and lymphocytes. It needs to be stressed that these observations represent measurements of pharmacological inflammatory effects of COAM in normal skin with intact epidermal and dermal layers.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Here, we investigated the role of the polysaccharide-derivative COAM as a novel antimicrobial agent against skin-related bacteria and as immunomodulatory compound in skin wound healing. As target bacteria, we mostly addressed <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> species, as they are commonly present in infected wounds. Inflammatory effects of COAM on mice with induced skin wounds as a comparison of the above-mentioned inflammation in skin with an intact epithelial barrier were investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Bacterial Strains and Media</title><p>Bacterial strains <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> subsp. <italic toggle="yes">aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538), <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> subsp. <italic toggle="yes">aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538P), methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> subsp. <italic toggle="yes">aureus</italic> (MRSA, UZ Gasthuisberg collection, Belgium), <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (ATCC 12228), biofilm-forming <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (ATCC 35984), <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (ATCC 15692), <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (ATCC BAA-47), <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus subtilis</italic> (EEUT VIL; CELMS microbe collection, Estonia), <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus cereus</italic> (ATCC 11778), <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> (EEUT EY; CELMS microbe collection, Estonia), were maintained on agar plates of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, and grown at 30&#x000b0;C or 37&#x000b0;C on LB or Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth.

In a second step of oxidation by sodium chlorite, the aldehyde functions are converted into carboxyl functions. The final product is referred to as chlorite-oxidized oxyamylose or COAM. COAM batches prepared were free of endotoxin and of protein contaminants, determined by Limulus amebocyte lysate test and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver staining, respectively.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Cytotoxicity of COAM on cell cultures was previously studied, and, related to antiviral activity, COAM has a safety index (toxic versus active concentration) in excess of 10.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2003"><title>Antimicrobial Tests</title><p>For bacteria growth curve determination, cultures grown overnight in MH medium were diluted to a final OD<sub>600</sub> 0.01 in Corning polystyrene clear flat-bottom 96-well microplates. The final volume per well was 0.1 mL. COAM was previously dissolved in Milli-Q water under sterile conditions to prepare a stock solution that was further diluted in the media to reach the final concentration of 1000 &#x000b5;g/mL per well. As a positive control, the bacterial strains were grown under the same conditions but without COAM. Tetracycline was used as antibiotic control at a final concentration of 50 &#x000b5;g/mL. Microplates were shaken at 30&#x000b0;C for 24 h and OD<sub>600</sub> was recorded using InfiniteM200 PRO microplate reader (Tecan Group Ltd.) equipped with Tecan i-control 1.7 software.</p><p>For minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, mid-log phase cultures at final OD<sub>600</sub> 0.01 were incubated with different concentrations of COAM in MH or LB medium. Corning polystyrene clear flat-bottom 96-well microplates were used and the final volume per well was 0.1 mL. Two-fold serial dilutions of COAM with final concentrations ranging between 15.6 &#x000b5;g/mL and 4000 &#x000b5;g/mL were used. The microplate was incubated for 20 h at 37&#x000b0;C and bacterial growth was determined by OD<sub>600</sub> measurement. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of COAM resulting in no detectable bacterial growth in the above-mentioned conditions.</p><p>To determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), colony-forming units (CFU/mL) were determined in bacterial suspensions from MIC analysis (after 20 h incubation with or without COAM) and in the initial inoculum. Briefly, 80 &#x000b5;L of bacterial suspensions treated with COAM (2000 &#x000b5;g/mL, 4000 &#x000b5;g/mL and 8000 &#x000b5;g/mL) which showed no visible sign of growth were sub-cultured by the spread plate technique on sterile MH agar plates. For CFU determination of the initial inoculum and of control samples (without COAM), 10-fold dilutions (range of 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> &#x02013; 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> dilutions) were plated to allow the counting of colonies. The plates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h, colonies were counted in the optimal dilution, and CFU/mL were calculated by the formula: CFU/mL = (number of colonies x dilution factor)/volume plated. For viability calculations, CFU/mL of the initial inoculum was taken as 100%. MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of COAM able to reduce 99.9% of bacterial viability compared with initial inoculum.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2004"><title>Wound Induction Models and Treatments</title><p>All procedures on mice conducted at KU Leuven were in accordance with the regulations of the European Union, Belgian and Flemish legislation, and approved by the local Ethics Committee (License number P270/2015, P128/2019, Belgium). Procedures performed at Uppsala University were approved by the Uppsala Regional Laboratory Animal Ethical Committee. Procedures with the use of bacteria strains were performed in agreement with the Belgian legislation on biosafety and supervised by the KU Leuven Health and safety department (VGM). Excisional wounds of the full thickness of the skin were induced in the back of C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory) mice to evaluate the effect of COAM on the wound and its healing.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and all hair was removed from skin areas with the use of a shaver and hair removal cream. The skin was lifted in the mid-dorsal line, folded and punched through with a 4 mm disposable sterile biopsy punch (Robbins Instruments), creating one wound on each side of the dorsal midline. The procedure was repeated two more times, generating 6 wounds per animal at locations that were inaccessible by the individual animals. After wound induction, single mice were housed in individual cages, to avoid confounding animal interactions, including biting and licking of wounds by other animals.</p><p>For the experiments of wound infection, <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> and MRSA infections were induced immediately after injury and investigated.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The experiment consisted of two groups of animals for each bacterial strain: a negative control group and a COAM-treatment group.

COAM-treated animals received COAM (1000 &#x000b5;g diluted in saline) together with bacteria inoculum (1x10<sup>4</sup> CFU) in a final volume of 10 &#x000b5;L per wound. Additionally, there were two control groups of non-infected animals: one receiving only saline and the other group receiving COAM treatment.</p><p>For the experiments aiming to investigate the effect of COAM on neutrophils, the wounds were topically treated with COAM immediately after injury.

Similar MIC values have also been described for sulphated EPS against <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>. Interestingly, this chemically modified EPS was shown to possess higher antimicrobial activity than its non-sulphated form (MIC values of 2 mg/mL and 6 mg/mL, respectively).<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Another widely recognized polysaccharide with good antibacterial activities is chitosan. Although chitosan has stronger antimicrobial activity than COAM and EPS, its use is limited to acidic conditions due to poor solubility in neutral environment.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> To overcome this limitation, chemical modifications are also commonly applied to chitosan.

Our data suggest that other mechanisms may be involved in the antimicrobial effect of COAM. Indeed, the activities of antibacterial polymers, hydrogels and scaffolds provide alternative explanations of action mechanisms, as recently reviewed. These mechanisms include decrease of biofilm formation, disturbance of bacterial membrane integrity, harmful impact on metabolism and other toxic effects.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Although in many studies COAM was confirmed to possess a broad antiviral spectrum and a good safety index, it was not further developed as an antiviral agent and its mechanism of action has remained controversial for a long time.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> With recent technologies and better views on immune cells and molecules against viruses, it was shown that COAM potently activates an innate cellular antiviral response.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Aside from chemokine induction, COAM also binds to chemokines. Because COAM has higher affinities for specific chemokines than endogenous GAGs, it may locally concentrate bound chemokines. This occurs in such a way that the COAM-bound chemokines retain their chemo-attractive activity.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition, because of its polymeric nature and in contrast to chemokines, COAM has limited tissue diffusion, retaining it at the site of application (eg, injection in wound edges). In this way, COAM-bound chemokines create strong local gradients, and COAM may therefore have additional activities as an immunomodulator in topical applications. With all combined characteristics, COAM creates strong chemotaxis in vivo into mouse skin with intact epithelial and dermal layers.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>In the present study, no changes were observed in neutrophil numbers after supplementation of COAM to the open wounds, in comparison with the vehicle.

Indeed, COAM amplified the endogenous signals evoked by wound induction, thus significantly recruiting more CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 monocytes/macrophages to the wounds compared to what was observed in control mice. In addition, increased macrophage recruitment coincided with an accelerated early wound healing process. Aside from the number of macrophages, their functionality is essential for skin wound repair. The phenotypic switch from a pro-inflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory profile contributes to the resolution of the inflammatory phase and consequently the transition into the proliferative phase.<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Lucas et al (2010) clearly showed through conditionally macrophage-depleted mice that the role of these inflammatory cells differs according to the wound healing phase.<xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Although we have not further characterized the phenotype of infiltrated macrophages, the expression of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 regulates multiple reparative processes in skin wound healing and is associated with a more resolutive profile in macrophages.<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> For instance, the failure of maturation into CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>hi</sup> macrophages, observed in diabetic wounds, contributes to a persistent inflammatory stage and impairment of the resolution of inflammation.<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Therefore, the use of COAM to promote CX<sub>3</sub>CR1 monocyte/macrophage recruitment may be an attractive strategy in chronic inflammatory environments. Future experiments will be directed at defining the molecular mechanisms involved in this observation. Additional limitations exist in the present work. First, follow-up studies will be needed to fully demonstrate the clinical effects of COAM on wound healing and whether its antiviral or antibacterial effects are useful. Because open skin wounds already provide maximum neutrophil influx, the effects of COAM may be limited to mononuclear cells, including hematopoietic precursor cells. Hematopoietic precursor cells are claimed to possess regenerative capacities. Alternatively, the neutrophil-potentiating effect of COAM may only become relevant in neutropenic patients, who form only a small subgroup of the cohort of skin wound patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Aside from its broad antiviral activity, COAM has an antibacterial effect in vitro which was selective against Gram-positive bacteria but not detected for tested Gram-negative bacterial species.

Furthermore, COAM has immunomodulatory effects in vivo, which are here extended to skin wound healing, and these effects deserve further exploration.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s0006"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors made substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; took part in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; agreed to submit to the current journal; gave final approval for the version to be published; and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0007"><title>Disclosure</title><p>Professor Mia Phillipson reports personal fees from Ilya pharma, outside the submitted work;</p><p>Dr Triinu Visnapuu reports personal fees from the University of Tartu, outside the submitted work;</p><p>Professor Ghislain Opdenakker reports grants from the Research Foundation of Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen), during the conduct of the study.

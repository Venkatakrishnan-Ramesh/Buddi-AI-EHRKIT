This power imbalance makes women vulnerable when having sexual relationships with their partner. However, no measurement tool has been developed to measure female sexual resourcefulness, which measures women&#x02019;s self-perceived sexual right to self-determination. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the female sexual resourcefulness scale (FSRS). Convenience sampling was conducted using social networking services. The participants were 217 women in their early 20s. Validity and reliability were examined using item analysis, factor analysis, and correlation with self-efficacy on condom use and self-efficacy in refusing sex, and Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha. Twelve items were selected for the study. Three factors were extracted through factor analysis, explaining 62.03% of the variance and showing a good model fit in the K-FSRS. Reliability was high, as indicated by a Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha of 0.85. These results indicate that the K-FSRS may be an appropriate instrument for measuring sexual resourcefulness among young Korean women.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>factor analysis</kwd><kwd>methodology</kwd><kwd>sexual behavior</kwd><kwd>validation study</kwd><kwd>women</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

Especially, gender and power inequalities in sexual relationships remain a major social issue: women have less control in sexual relationships than men do.</p><p>Traditional gender norms that prevent women from rejecting men in sexual relationship have left women vulnerable to unwanted sex.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The South Korean double-gender standard continues to exist under the patriarchal system with more permissive standards for men, and strict standards for women in sexual practices.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> According to a study of unmarried college students in South Korea, women with patriarchal sexual norms experienced difficulties in practicing contraception and had passive sexual behaviors. On the other hand, women with flexible gender norms showed positive attitudes toward high contraceptive practices and contraceptive self-efficacy.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, looking specifically at the double-gender standards as an example of sexual resourcefulness among younger generation will contribute to the understanding of the reproductive health at large.</p><p>Some of the important worldwide factors are gender and power in sexual and reproductive health behaviors and outcomes.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Efforts to improve gender and power equality in sexual relationships continue to be made at all levels, from individual to the national. Men are more dominant than women also in sexual relationships.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Previous studies have shown that women have less control over decisions about risky sexual behavior and condom use than men.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Differences in relationship power can prevent successful negotiations on the use of condoms for safe sex, as decisions vary depending on whether partners with more power want to use condoms or not.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> One study found that women with more power in relationships were significantly more likely to consistently use condoms than women with less power in relationships.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In this regard, women exposed to these factors have less power in practicing safe sex behavior, because they are less likely to have authoritative influence and control in their relationships. A study by Kim et al<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> also asserted that women with high sexual self-assertion are less likely to have unsafe and risky sex with their partners. However, studies exploring the link between relationship power and condom use in Korea are limited. Since the power imbalance in sex still exists in South Korea, such as men taking the lead in decision-making regarding sexual relationships,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> it seems necessary to try to understand the power imbalance related to sexual assertiveness.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, traditional gender norms and power imbalances in sex can indirectly or directly increase vulnerability to partner violence, as well as reduce contraceptive method use.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Sexual violence is often caused by unilateral coercion during a date without the consent of the partner.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The domestic dating violence report rate is increasing from 13.0% in 2014 to 19.9% in 2017. It was reported that the suspects of partner violence were mainly men, and those in their 20s experienced more partner violence than other groups.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> One study found that women with traditional gender norms were more likely to experience sexual assault by their partner due to lower self-efficacy in sexual assertions and relationships.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This means that individuals with low sexual assertions are vulnerable to the physical and psychological damage caused by unwanted sexual behavior, and are unable to act or make decisions for themselves during sexual relationships.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Therefore, in order to prevent sexual violence during dating, women should have the right to sexual self-determination to protect themselves from unwanted or unsafe sexual experiences.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>However, there are limited tools for measuring women&#x02019;s sexual self-determination rights in South Korea. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to translate Humphreys and Kennett&#x02019;s<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Female sexual resourcefulness scale (FSRS) into Korean to measure the sexual self-determination rights of unmarried women in their 20s in South Korea and evaluate the reliability and validity of the Korean FSRS version.

The instrument translation procedure was done by the World Health Organization [WHO] instrument translation and application guidelines. The FRFS was translated from English to Korean using the parallel back-translation supplemented with committee review to reflect culture. First, two Korean-American bilingual translators translated the scale from English to Korean. Then, the authors discussed the expressions and vocabulary for the translation, the clarity of translation, and whether they require correction due to cultural differences. Then, another independent translator fluent in English and Korean undertook the task of back-translation. After that, both versions were reviewed by the authors of this study to identify and resolve inconsistencies between the original English and translated Korean versions. Then, two new independent translators native to the original FRFS repeated the procedure. Finally, a committee of authors re-examined the social and cultural aspects of the forward and back translations. After the agreed discussion, there were no minor modifications to account for improved grammar clarity and item equivalence. The instrument was finalized based on the suggestions. Finally, 19 questionnaires of the Korean version of the FRFS (K-FRFS) were produced.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2005"><title>The Validation Process</title><p>To create a K-FRFS, the authors explained the goals of the study to an instrument developer and received permission to verify its validity and reliability.</p><sec id="s0002-s2005-s3001"><title>Content Validity</title><p>Four experts, two of whom were experts in women&#x02019;s health and sexual behavior and the other two, lecturers who taught nursing, assessed the validity of the content to evaluate the appropriateness of the forward-backward-translated questionnaire. At this stage, pre-testing and cognitive interviewing were processed by the experts not only for clarity and flow but also for social and cultural considerations. Item-level Content Validity Index (I-CVI) was used. According to Polit et al,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> I-CVI is a method of calculating the ratio of the number of experts who selected 3 points (relevant, but item correction is required) and 4 points (very relevant) among the evaluators for the tool item. If it is more than 0.80, it is evaluated that adequate content validity is secured. No ratings less than 3 were selected (none were deleted). After verifying content validity, the final version of the K-FRFS consisted of 19 items. In addition, some words and phrases were revised to fit Korean culture more appropriately.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2005-s3002"><title>Construct Validity</title><sec id="s0002-s2005-s3002-s4001"><title>Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)</title><p>EFA with Varimax rotation was performed below oblique rotations.

Women who were highly sexually resourceful were less likely to give in to unwanted sexual activities. Also, higher sexual resourcefulness uniquely correlated with higher learned resourcefulness, higher sexual self-efficacy, and fewer reasons for consenting to unwanted sexual activity. That is, it is important to suggest that women with lower sexual resourcefulness are at higher risk associated with unwanted sexual behavior. However, in non-Western countries, especially East Asian countries, there has not been much discussion on or examination of this and no appropriate tool exists to measure sexual resourcefulness in South Korea. The twenties, a period of young adulthood, is a period in which sexual identity, autonomy, and independence are formed, especially when gender norms are formed.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>People in their 20s, during a period of active sexual behavior, have had more than one sexual partner in the past year.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Nevertheless, it was found that women had low self-efficacy and sufficient information about sex. For example, there is a lack of knowledge about sexual health and contraception and mainly males talk about their responsibility for contraception and testing for STDs in their sexual behavior.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> This suggests that women&#x02019;s right to sexual self-determination is low. Therefore, in order to mediate sexual resourcefulness for women, a tool to measure it must be developed.</p><p>In the case of South Korea, which is included in the Asian culture, not the Western culture, studies related to sex mainly focused on sexual knowledge, sexual attitudes, and education.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, most studies have focused on measuring fragmentary variables or identifying the effects of interventional studies; however, significant studies on the right to sexual resourcefulness have not been conducted.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Understanding the sexual self-determination rights of women during this period is essential as a basis for future intervention studies.</p><p>This study aimed to apply K-FSRS to Korean women and confirmed the validity and reliability of the Korean version. The K-FSRS has the advantage of being able to easily measure the degree of sexual resourcefulness for Korean women with a total of 12 items. For this purpose, the tool developed in the previous study of Western<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> was applied to Korean. In order to reflect the tools developed abroad in Korean culture and awards, social and cultural differences were reflected in the translation and reverse translation process. This study, a number of experts and 217 women in their 20s participated in this study to verify validity and reliability. As a result, K-FSRS was completed as a tool of 19 items with the final three sub-factors. The sub-domains of this tool are &#x0201c;Adjust to situation&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Use of rejection skills&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;Thinks about coping strategies&#x0201d;. In the case of the original tool, it was a one-dimensional scale with no sub-regions, but in this study, it was found to consist of a total of three sub-factors. This is thought to be due to cultural and linguistic differences. In particular, this study is significant in that Asian women play a more passive role than Western women in sexual situations.</p><p>Factor 1 is &#x0201c;Adjust to situation&#x0201d;, which exhibits characteristics such as conformity, obedience, and submission to undesirable situations. These traits are sometimes thought to be due to power imbalance,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and low sexual resourcefulness due to power imbalance could serve as a factor that increases the risk of sexual activity. Various factors have a complex effect on the norm related to sexual behavior.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> For example, institutional, individual, social, and resources aspects affect power, and social and gender norms affect power and ultimately sexual health.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In addition, it is known that women with low sexual volunteering are more likely to engage in unwanted sexual activity.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In the case of women who support traditional gender roles, it was also found that they consent to unwanted sexual behavior. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, it will be necessary to overcome the established gender inequality in South Korea. For this, it will be important to provide education on gender inequality, including education on gender norms. Indeed, gender inequality can cause changes in women&#x02019;s sexual behavior by leading them to play decision-making roles in sexual relationships. This, in turn, exposes them to violent behavior or unwanted sexual advances, which can have negative consequences for their reproductive health.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Factor 2 is &#x0201c;Use of rejection skills&#x0201d; and includes items of rejection and resistance in unwanted situations. Women in their 20s face various barriers to sexual well-being, such as a lack of autonomy.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In these difficult situations, it is important to use the appropriate skills well to overcome the situation.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In the case of women, it was found that the self-efficacy in communicating about contraception in sexual situations was lower than that of men.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore, it is necessary to educate women on refusal skills so that they are prepared for situations where they actually need to refuse; this will enhance their sexual self-determination.</p><p>Factor 3 is &#x0201c;Think about coping strategies&#x0201d; and includes items to consider, think, consider, and judge. In other words, it represents the experience of contemplating a sexual situation that women themselves do not want and rehearsing for the situation in advance. It suggests that sexual resourcefulness can be positively affected if adequate coping skills and strategies are used through adequate self-reflection and planning.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In other words, it will be helpful for sexual resourcefulness to reflect on the situation through sufficient education and practice and to think about how to deal with it in advance, suggesting that the right to sexual resourcefulness can be improved through training. In fact, high-quality sex education can increase sexual self-efficacy and sexual satisfaction.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Soon it will have a positive effect on the right to sexual resourcefulness. Importantly, the way sex education is delivered should provide opportunities for women to train themselves.</p><p>To measure criterion validity, we used self-efficacy on condom use<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and self-efficacy in refusing sex<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> tools to examine the correlation with K-FSRS. As a result, it was confirmed that the correlation coefficient was 0.566 and 0.445, respectively, which fell within the recommended range.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Self-efficacy is a factor influencing sexual resourcefulness,<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and previous studies have shown that sexual resourcefulness and sexual behavior are closely related.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In fact, it was found that the higher the self-efficacy, the more cases of rejection in unwanted situations.</p><p>This study is meaningful in that it verified the validity and reliability of a measurement tool for sexual resourcefulness for Korean women. In the case of women, in a previous study,<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> 65% of participants responded that they had experienced unwanted sexual intercourse or sexual violence, and in fact, Asian students showed lower sexual communication and self-efficacy than other students.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In other words, it suggests that this study is meaningful because it indicates the need to measure the sexual resourcefulness of Asian women.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Limitations and Strengths</title><p>Our study faced some limitations in that we had a sample which only included heterosexual young Korean women. Therefore, future studies should include participants of diverse genders, ages, sexual orientations, and regional and ethnic backgrounds A successive large-scale study including LGBTQ population should be conducted. In addition, although the adapted K-FSRS was found to be valid and reliable, this study relied on self-reports to measure sexual resourcefulness. Future research should include a mixed approach which uses both quantitative and qualitative methods to better understand power dynamics related to gender-related sexual and reproductive-health behaviors. These limitations may restrict the generalizability of our findings in the present study.</p><p>However, the results of this study supplemented our knowledge of power imbalances with respect to gender in the sexual behavior of young Korean women. These findings provide several implications for practice, and consequently, it may be concluded that the K-FSRS is a valuable tool to measure sexual resourcefulness.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study attempted to validate the FSRS and determine whether it could be modified to create K-FSRS. In addition, the findings of this study suggest that the K-FSRS was adequately valid and reliable in this participant group, that is, Korean women in their 20s. Thus, we could conclude that this study corroborated the utility of the K-FSRS in measuring sexual resourcefulness in Korean young women and contributes to the examination of FSRS across diverse populations.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0007"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>K&#x000e5;gesten</surname>

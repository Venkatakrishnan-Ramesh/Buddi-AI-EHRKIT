Besides protection from SARS-CoV-2, YF-S0 also induced strong yellow fever virus (YFV)-specific immunity, suggestive for full dual activity. A vaccine concomitantly protecting from SARS-CoV-2 and YFV would be of great benefit for those living in YFV-endemic areas with limited access to current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

<boxed-text id="tbox0002"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><sec id="sec0001"><title>Evidence before this study</title><p id="para0006">Live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine YF17D is the basis for two licensed vaccines and other promising YF17D-based vaccine candidates, amongst others, Zika, HIV, Ebola, Lassa and malaria are under development. Generally, such derivatives inherit the excellent safety and immunogenicity profile from parental YF17D. We developed a YF17D-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (YF-S0) that induced rapidly high level of neutralizing antibodies against both SARS-CoV-2 and YFV when tested in macaques, highlighting its potential as a dual-target vaccine. Generally, pre-existing flaviviruses immunity may interfere with subsequent infection or vaccination. However, though YF17D is a widely used vaccines as well as potent viral vector, the impact of pre-existing YFV immunity on such YF17D-derivatives remains largely unknown.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="para0007">In this study, we show that YF-S0 fully protects against lethal infection in a stringent intracranial YF17D challenge model in mice, and against vigorous challenge using hamster-adapted YFV Asibi in hamsters as relevant model that recapitulates yellow fever pathogenesis in humans. Such remarkable potency confirms superior efficacy of YF17D-vectored vaccines against not only the thus vectored target antigen but also YFV. When we evaluated the impact of pre-existing YFV immunity in these two animal models, there was no evidence that strong vector-specific immunity would hamper the immunogenicity or protective efficacy of YF-S0, neither in mice nor hamsters and much in contrast to other viral vector platforms currently used in vaccine development. Likewise, our data suggest that YF-S0 and other YF17D-derivatives can also successful be used in populations with a high yellow fever vaccine coverage, for instance in Africa and South America.</p></sec><sec id="sec0003"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="para0008">This study strongly suggests that YF-S0 could serve as a dual vaccine against both SARS-CoV-2 and YFV. Moreover, unlike other viral vector vaccines, pre-existing YFV immunity has no notable impact on novel YF17D-derived vaccines, endorsing their use also in people that have been vaccinated before.</p></sec><notes notes-type="alt-text" specific-use="for-accessibility" id="alte1"><p>Alt-text: Unlabelled box</p></notes></boxed-text>

YF17D is exceptionally efficient in inducing vigorous innate, long-lasting humoral and polyfunctional cell mediated immune (CMI) responses that possibly warrant life-long protection in most vaccinees.<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> This outstanding efficacy of YF17D is combined with a very favourable safety profile.<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p id="para0010">YFV is a highly pathogenic mosquito-borne small RNA virus which may result in a up to 60% mortality in infected patients.

Manufacturing in embryonated chicken eggs and need for a strict cold-chain for distribution make that classical YF17D vaccines are unable to keep up with the high global demand and YFV is estimated to still cause up to 60,000 fatalities annually.<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> After decades of relatively low epidemic activity, recently several large YFV outbreaks (Angola 2015-2016, DRC 2016, Brazil 2016-2019, Nigeria 2017) led to an unprecedented vaccine shortage and repeated depletion of the global YF17D emergency stockpile.<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Furthermore, increasing global travel bares the risk of YFV being imported into regions where the virus is historically absent, such as the Asia Pacific region, that harbors both dense populations of competent vector mosquitos and billions of immunologically na&#x000ef;ve people, raising serious concerns of massive future epidemics.<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> A more sustainable YF17D vaccine supply and novel vaccines against YFV are needed.<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p id="para0011">Beyond its use as genuine YFV vaccine, YF17D serves a particularly potent vector platform for several licensed recombinant vaccines; ChimeriVax-JE/Imojev&#x000ae; against Japanese encephalitis and CYD-TDV/Dengvaxia&#x000ae; against dengue.<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Other YF17D-based live vaccine candidates are under development, e.g. variants expressing foreign antigens from Lassa, Zika, or rabies virus, or therapeutic candidates for chronic hepatitis B.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Such YF17D derivatives generally inherit the excellent safety and immunogenicity features from parental YF17D.<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> However, little attention has been paid so far to the fact that the available YF17D backbone may, besides promoting the immunogenicity of the thus vectored new antigen, suffice to conjointly induce full protection from YFV infection as well; hence creating in fact dual target vaccines.<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Likewise, the impact of pre-existing YFV immunity on the broader usability of YF17D as vaccine vector is limited to chimeric vaccines with their antigenic surface proteins swapped for those of other flaviviruses from distinct serogroups.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Notably, for other virus-vectored vaccines, such as adenovirus-based vaccines, pre-existing anti-vector immunity is known to strongly interfere, compromise or modify subsequent target antigen-specific immunogenicity.<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p id="para0012">Recently, we engineered a live-attenuated YF17D vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (YF-S0), which expresses the non-cleavable stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen as in-frame fusion within the YF17D-E/NS1 intergenic region. Two doses of YF-S0 given 7 days apart were shown to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) and strong antiviral CMI responses against both SARS-CoV-2, and resulted in full protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection in cynomolgus macaques and COVID-19-like lung pathology in a stringent hamster model. Moreover, in hamsters a single high dose of YF-S0 was sufficient to confer 60% and 100% protection from vigorous challenge within 10 and 21 days post immunization, respectively.<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> YF-S0 safety was improved compared to parental YF17D, including in severely immune-compromised mice and hamsters, with limited biodistribution and shedding, and no mosquito transmission.<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Importantly, in addition to strong SARS-CoV-2 immunity, YF-S0 consistently induced high levels of YFV-specific nAbs, correlating with protection from lethal intracranial YF17D challenge in type I interferon receptor-deficient (<italic>Ifnar<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>) mice.<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Such a dual activity of YF-S0 may serve as special asset in poorly developed regions, for instance of Africa, where vaccine supply for both YFV and COVID-19 remains challenging.<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref></p><p id="para0013">Here, we further evaluate in particular the YFV-specific immunity induced by single-dose YF-S0 vaccination and show how it translates, alike original YF17D, into full protection against YFV challenge in both stringent mouse and hamster models. Finally, we demonstrate how full protection of hamsters from vigorous SARS-CoV-2 challenge can readily be achieved by single-dose YF-S0 immunization, including in animals with strong pre-existing YFV-specific immunity. This lack of interference with vector immunity is unparalleled and may be unique to the live-attenuated YF17D vector platform.</p></sec><sec id="sec0005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec0006"><title>Cells</title><p id="para0014">BHK-21J (baby hamster kidney fibroblasts) cells were kindly provided by Prof. P.

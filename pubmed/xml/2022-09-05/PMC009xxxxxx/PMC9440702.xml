The RVO manifests as a sudden, painless, unilateral decrease in visual acuity, which depends on the degree of closure of the vessel, the size and location of the occupied retinal area and the size of the macular area affected by the clot. Metamorphopsia, relative loss of visual field, appears,<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and the fundus of the eye shows retinal oedema, &#x0201c;cotton-wool spots&#x0201d;, blurred optic disc margins, intraretinal haemorrhages and dilated, tortuous veins. Patients with peripheral thrombosis may not have any symptoms. A complication of RVO may be neovascularization, which usually develops within 6&#x02013;12 months. Neovascularization outside the optic disc (NVE &#x02013; neovascularization elsewhere) develops more often than the form with vessels on the disc (NVD &#x02013; neovascularization on the disc) and is usually formed at the border of perfusion-free areas drained by a closed vein. Proliferating vessels may cause recurrent haemorrhages to the vitreous, tractional retinal detachment, and development of secondary glaucoma.</p><p>The factors predisposing to clotting can be divided into systemic and local. The first group includes factors that increase blood viscosity: Waldenstr&#x000f6;m&#x02019;s macroglobulinemia, proliferative diseases of the hematopoietic system, sickle cell anemia, thrombophilia, diabetes mellitus,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> hypertension,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular diseases,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> obesity, oral contraceptives, smoking, dehydration, and hot climate.

As a result of their interaction, hypoxia, and ischemia results in increased hydrostatic pressure in venous vessels and capillaries, development and progression of inflammatory processes, dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells and increased VEGF concentration in the vitreous.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Depending on the thrombus localization, we distinguish between central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The presence or absence of abnormalities in blood flow through retinal capillaries in CRVO enables to divide CRVO into ischemic forms if there are nonperfusion zones and non-ischemic forms if the capillary flow is maintained.</p><p>In venous thromboembolism, plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation and deformability are increased.

</p><p>Numerous publications support a 6-month duration of action for the intravitreal dexamethasone implant. Our study lasted only one month because its purpose was to show the effect of intravitreal dexamethasone on hemorheological parameters and not to evaluate the duration of its action. Intravitreal dexamethasone in RVO affects hemorrhagic parameters because it penetrates the systemic circulation through the damaged blood-retinal barrier. The train of thought was based on the available literature on an animal model of drug permeation into the systemic circulation through a damaged internal blood-retinal barrier (iBRB), in the course of central retinal vein thrombosis.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>The hemorheological parameters of peripheral blood were analyzed: hematocrit, blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation amplitude, erythrocyte aggregation index, erythrocyte half-life and erythrocyte deformability. In addition, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA, Snellen charts), central retinal thickness (CRT, Optical Coherence Tomography &#x02013; OCT) and visual field (static examination, mean loss of retinal sensitivity, MD &#x02013; mean defect, Octopus 300) were examined. Multiple studies demonstrate the validity of microperimetry in the diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases, and it is likely that microperimetry would have been a better choice in our study. Nevertheless, the main aim of the study was to assess blood rheological parameters, and visual field testing was only an additional clinical and functional parameter.</p><p>The erythrocyte aggregation parameters were measured using the LORCA (Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer) by Mechatronics (LORCA), obtaining the curves of dependence of scattered light intensity on time and shear rate, the so-called sylektograms.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The measurements of erythrocyte deformability (elongation), after choosing the appropriate software option, were also performed with the use of LORCA analyzer to obtain a diffraction image from which the elongation index (EI) is calculated by computer. The value of EI depends on the size of the diffractive image.

Transport across the retinal vascular wall extracellular, but also intercellular, is increased by the opening of endothelial intercellular junctions and by qualitative and quantitative changes in intercellular transport. Retinal hypoxia leads to the collapse of the iBRB, which is associated with increased vascular permeability, causing angioedema. Damage to the iBRB is associated with increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nitric oxide (NO), oxidative stress and inflammation. Understanding the complex cellular and molecular processes involved in iBRB leakage has increased rapidly in recent years. These insights have provided tools for the rational design of drugs aimed at restoring blood&#x02013;retinal barrier function of the iBRB.</p><p>Ozurdex effectively reduces macular oedema and improves visual acuity in patients with CRVO and BRVO, as demonstrated in the multicenter GENEVA study. On the 180th day after injection, a statistically significant difference in visual acuity was found between the group that received Ozurdex and the placebo group, but without a significant difference in retinal thickness, which suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms of action of the drug on visual acuity, in addition to the reduction of retinal thickness in patients with RVO and macular oedema. Similar conclusions were drawn after the analysis of the SCORE study, in which triamcinolone was administered by the retina. The correlation between retinal thickness and improvement of visual acuity was poor.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In our study, after the use of prolonged-action dexamethasone (Ozurdex), this correlation was stronger (about 7%) and statistically significant, in contrast to the effect of triamcinolone administration. Our study, compared to the SCORE and GENEVA studies, was enriched with an analysis of mean loss of retinal sensitivity (MD). The results were analyzed at the same time points as visual acuity.</p><p>Improvement of visual acuity, reduction of central retinal thickness and reduction of mean loss of retinal sensitivity were statistically significant at all time points studied, ie, after 7 and 30 days and between 7 and 30 days after Ozurdex administration.</p><p>To identify other factors explaining the influence of Ozurdex on clinical improvement (in terms of visual acuity) in patients with retinal vein occlusion, its influence on some hemorheological parameters was analyzed. One of the studied parameters was erythrocyte aggregation, which is an important factor determining blood flow parameters and is responsible for increasing its viscosity under slow flow conditions (low shear rate). The size of erythrocyte aggregates is a result of repulsive forces between negatively charged erythrocytes, erythrocyte adhesion induced by plasma proteins and shear forces generated by blood flow. Under physiological conditions, blood flow is sufficient to break down the forming aggregates (disaggregation), which ensures proper tissue perfusion. Under slow flow conditions and other pathological states related to increased erythrocyte aggregation, microcirculation and closure of venous capillaries may be disturbed.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Venous microcirculation in the retina is characterized by slow flow and increased vascular resistance, which significantly limits its adaptive abilities in response to increased blood viscosity.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In the available literature, hemorheological abnormalities are described not only in RVO but also in other ophthalmologic diseases, eg, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which suggests the relationship between angiogenesis factors (VEGF), hematological factors, hemostasis, endothelial dysfunction, and AMD. The interaction between abnormal angiogenesis and Virchow&#x02019;s triad components and thrombogenesis may partially contribute to AMD development.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> An interesting observation is hemorheological changes in patients with diabetic retinopathy compared to the control group. Statistically significantly higher values of hematocrit, fibrinogen, increased blood and plasma viscosity and increased erythrocyte aggregation were found. There was no significant difference in hemorheological variables in different stages of retinopathy (non-proliferative, pre-proliferative and proliferative), but the participation of these factors in the development of diabetic microangiopathy was indicated.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>The hemodynamic characteristics of venous circulation in the retina make it particularly dependent on rheological parameters of blood, and the shape deformability of erythrocyte aggregates begins to be crucial for flow. In our examined group of patients, three out of several evaluated hemorheological parameters changed significantly after administration of Ozurdex: erythrocyte aggregation amplitude (Amp), erythrocyte aggregation index (AI) and erythrocyte aggregation recovery half-life (T1/2), which suggests that dexamethasone in the form of a long-acting, biodegradable implant, administered intravitreally (Ozurdex), used in the treatment of macular oedema in patients with RVO, directly affects the RVO pathomechanism, which may be the key mechanism of its action in the treatment of RVO. Clinical improvement in visual acuity and visual field in patients with RVO treated with dexamethasone administered intravitreally can be associated with the reduction of central retinal oedema. Clinical improvement is also influenced by the change in microcirculation flow associated with shortened erythrocyte disaggregation time. Increase in erythrocyte aggregation amplitude in patients with RVO treated with dexamethasone administered intravenously correlates negatively with MD visual field parameter, and reduction of retinal oedema correlates negatively with improvement of visual acuity during observation (30 days) and may be a predictor of improvement of visual acuity. However, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed in a large prospective study. The improvement of hemorheological profile (Amp &#x02013; increase, AI &#x02013; decrease, T1/2 &#x02013; elongation), which reflects the erythrocyte disaggregation process induced by dexamethasone, shown in our study, was stable, constant, and sustained until the end of the study.</p><p>During the observation period (30 days), long-acting, biodegradable dexamethasone, used in the form of intravitreal implant in patients with RVO in the treatment of retinal post-thrombotic changes, statistically significantly increases the erythrocyte aggregation amplitude, reduces the erythrocyte aggregation index and extends the erythrocyte half-aggregation time, which can be associated with its effectiveness in the treatment of RVO.</p><p>The predictor of improving visual acuity in RVO can be both hemorheological and morphological parameters of the retina, ie, reduction of erythrocyte aggregation amplitude in the 7th day after the intravitreal administration of a long-acting, biodegradable dexamethasone implant, which correlates negatively with visual field parameters in the 7th and 30th day and reduction of retinal thickness in the central retina on the 7th and 30th day after intravitreal administration of a long-term biodegradable dexamethasone implant, which correlates with improved visual acuity. The limitation of our study is a relatively small group of 35 patients and short duration of observation (30 days) although the drug has been shown to last up to 6 months once released into the vitreous. Nevertheless, we have shown that significant changes in hemorheological profile are observed in the first 30 days after intravitreal application of dexamethasone implant. Longer observation on a larger group is needed to confirm whether the effect of dexamethasone implant on the hemorheological parameters of the blood is sustained for a longer period of time, and how these parameters change when the effect of the drug subsides over time.</p><p>The beneficial clinical effect of dexamethasone in the form of a long-acting, biodegradable, intravitreal implant can be associated with a reduction in the thickness of the central retina and an improvement in retinal microcirculation flow associated with a reduction in erythrocyte disaggregation time.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the study and their statistical analysis suggest that dexamethasone in the form of a long-acting, biodegradable intravitreal implant (Ozurdex) is effective and safe in the treatment of post-thrombotic lesions in RVO patients and significantly affects the amplitude of aggregation of erythrocytes, erythrocyte aggregation index and half-time reconstitution of aggregation of erythrocytes, directly interferes with RVO pathomechanism, which may be a key mechanism of action in RVO therapy.

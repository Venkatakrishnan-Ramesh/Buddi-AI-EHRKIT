However, this mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we discovered a disease-causing prion mutation (Q212P) that exceptionally promoted the extracellular release of PrP. Spatiotemporal analyses combined with genome editing identified the role of sheddase ADAM10 in Q212P shedding from the cell surface. ADAM10 was observed to catalytically interacts with Q212P but non-catalytically with wild-type PrP (wtPrP). This intrinsic difference in the interaction of ADAM10 between Q212P and wtPrP allowed Q212P to selectively access the sheddase activity of ADAM10 in a redox-sensitive manner. In addition, redox perturbation instigated the latent misfolding propensity of Q212P and disrupted the catalytic interaction between PrP and ADAM10, resulting in the accumulation of misfolded PrP on the cell surface. Upon recovery, active ADAM10 was able to reversibly release the surface Q212P. However, it might prove detrimental if unregulated resulting in unexpected proteotoxicity. This study provides a molecular basis of the mutant-selective shedding of PrP by demonstrating the catalytic interaction of ADAM10 with Q212P.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Pathogenic Q212P mutation provides a unique pattern of PrP metabolism.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Q212P mutation promotes the extracellular release of surface PrP.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Q212P shedding is catalyzed by ADAM10.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">ADAM10-mediated Q212P shedding is redox-sensitive.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Protein quality control</kwd><kwd>Protein shedding</kwd><kwd>Prion protein</kwd><kwd>ADAM10</kwd><kwd>Redox</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">Secretory and membrane proteins newly synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) undergo folding, modifications, and a complex assembly during transit through the secretory pathway. This enables the proteins to acquire unique three-dimensional structures for efficient functioning [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These processes require a sophisticated collaboration of various molecular chaperones and are prone to perturbation by mutations, translational errors, or different environmental stresses [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In general, these perturbations restrict many newly synthesized proteins from folding properly and therefore, such proteins are efficiently removed by a timely activation of quality control (QC) mechanisms [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, some misfolded proteins may accumulate in secretory organelles or on the cell surface, leading to risks of proteotoxicity [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is the most extensively studied and conceptualized QC mechanism in the stressed ER, in which thousands of misfolded substrates with varying biophysical parameters are recognized by adaptors in the ER lumen, delivered to the cytosolic side, extracted from the ER, and degraded in the proteasome. The first two steps are critical and therefore, tightly controlled in a substrate-specific manner in the ER lumen, while the next two occur in the cytosol and are shared by almost all substrates [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Owing to this, at present, the major interest lies in elucidating the factors or mechanisms that discriminate potential ERAD substrates expected to be misfolded from a pool of newly synthesized proteins in the folding process. For example, misfolding of glycoproteins identified as the most extensively studied group of ERAD substrates is mediated by aberrant glycan modifications and is recognized by ER-resident lectins [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, not all misfolded proteins synthesized in the ER are degraded by ERAD. One such typical ERAD-resistant misfolding-prone protein is the prion protein (PrP) synthesized in a form covalently attached to the luminal side of the ER membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0045">PrP is a mysterious protein for which the conformational conversion from its native cellular form (PrP<sup>C</sup>) to its pathological isoform (PrP<sup>SC</sup>) directly correlates with the pathogenesis of fatal neurodegenerative disorders [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. More than 30 variants in the human <italic>PrP</italic> have been identified as causes of prion diseases characterized with diverse heterogeneous phenotypes [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Notably, these mutations often act during the conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> and perturb its trafficking or processing, therefore, resulting in the accumulation of misfolded PrP in intracellular compartments during passage through the secretory pathway [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Misfolded PrP accumulation may occurs due to inefficient clearance of conformationally problematic PrP mutants. This can be resolved by various QC mechanisms that are mechanistically different from ERAD and are rapidly activated in response to ER stress [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p id="p0050">For example, <italic><underline>p</underline></italic>reemptive QC (pQC) aborts the production of difficult-to-fold proteins, including PrP, at the step of protein translocation across the ER membrane [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In one of our recent studies, we have revealed that pQC is utilized for <italic><underline>m</underline></italic>utant-<italic><underline>s</underline></italic>elective <italic><underline>t</underline></italic>opologic <italic><underline>c</underline></italic>onversion (MSTC) of PrP, which selectively removes the membrane-anchored PrP isoform (ctmPrP) and alleviates PrP proteotoxicity [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, <italic><underline>r</underline></italic>apid <italic><underline>E</underline></italic>R <italic><underline>s</underline></italic>tress-induced <italic><underline>e</underline></italic>xpor<italic><underline>t</underline></italic> (RESET) rapidly exports ERAD-resistant misfolded PrP from the stressed ER [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This exported PrP forms a complex with ER-derived chaperones and cargo receptors, is escorted through the secretory pathway, and is transiently expressed on the cell surface before being subjected to lysosomal degradation [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As such, both pQC and RESET are undoubtedly beneficial to reduce substrate burden and restore the folding capacity in stressed ER.</p><p id="p0055">More recently, we found that the endocytosis of PrP mutants defective in the disulfide bridge, a well-characterized RESET substrate, is inhibited at the cell surface as a result of the removal of the unpaired free-thiol group through the <italic><underline>p</underline></italic>lasma <italic><underline>m</underline></italic>embrane QC (pmQC) mechanism [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. pQC and pmQC act by reducing the burden of misfolded PrP entering the ER and lysosome, respectively. pQC is broadly utilized by the cells for many substrates in a signal sequence-dependent manner, whereas pmQC has a limited substrate range owing to its activation mediated in a conformation-dependent manner.</p><p id="p0060">A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), a major sheddase along with its close relative ADAM17, has been identified as a potential modulator of the pmQC for PrP [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. ADAM10/17 are membrane-integrated proteins and ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. Thses proteins are able to function as molecular scissors and proteolytically cleave the extracellular regions or ectodomains of at least 40 integral membrane proteins playing important roles in cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, migration, immunity, and receptor-ligand signaling [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. PrP is the first GPI-anchored protein identified as a common substrate for ADAM10/17 [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Of these, ADAM10 has been reported to cleave the site in close proximity to the GPI-anchor linked to the C-terminus of surface PrP between the amino acid positions, Gly<sup>228</sup> and Arg<sup>229</sup>, resulting in the release of anchorless PrP into the extracellular space [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, the processes regulating the extracellular release of anchorless PrP mediated by ADAM10/17 remain poorly defined.</p><p id="p0065">In the present study, we found a naturally occurring pathogenic PrP mutant (Q212P) processed by pmQC. Spatiotemporal analysis of PrP expression, trafficking, and processing, combined with genome editing, identified ADAM10 as a pmQC regulator that triggered Q212P shedding from the cell surface. This study unraveled the molecular basis of this triage reaction that occurred at the cell surface in response to the environmental redox perturbations. This study also provided an insight into the ADAM10-mediated Q212P shedding as a peripheral QC to protect cells from the surface overload of misfolded PrP.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p id="p0070">The following antibodies were used in this study: antisera for TRAP&#x003b1;, Sec61&#x003b2;, GFP, and RFP were as described previously [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>].

Most notably, in contrast to wtPrP synthesized in four different forms corresponding to non-, mono-, di-, and fully glycosylated forms, Q212P was synthesized in two major forms, i.e., di- and fully-glycosylated forms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Of these two forms, the fully-glycosylated form modified by complex glycan while passing through post-ER compartments during the secretory pathway (i.e., as it is sensitive to PNGase F but resistant to Endo H) was selectively augmented by&#x000a0;&#x0223c;&#x000a0;1.6-fold as a result of Q212P mutation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, see also <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1A</xref>). This pattern is not generally observed in pathogenic PrP mutants [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], as shown by the H187R mutant, which did not synthesize the fully glycosylated form (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1A</xref>). Nevertheless, the general pattern in subcellular localization of PrP was unchanged by the Q212P mutation, as visualized by the complete overlap of Q212P-RFP and wtPrP-GFP at the cell surface and intracellular compartments (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1B</xref>). In contrast, the surface localization of PrP was selectively inhibited by Q212P mutation through repressed de novo protein synthesis using cycloheximide (CHX), suggesting a possible role of Q212P mutation in promoting the clearance of surface PrP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Spatiotemporal analyses of PrP expression</p><p><bold>(A)</bold> The effect of Q212P mutation on general patterns of PrP subpopulations accumulated in cells was analyzed by immunoblotting.

In this experiment, inducible expression of stably integrated untagged PrP allowed us to efficiently discriminate the small differences in sizes of folding intermediates transiently synthesized in transit through the secretory compartments. Consistent with the result of immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A), wtPrP was newly synthesized in non-, mono-, and di-glycosylated forms in pulse-labeled cells, whereas the Q212P mutant was synthesized predominantly in a di-glycosylated form without detectable amounts of the other forms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). During the chase, the di-glycosylated forms of both wtPrP and Q212P were trimmed with glucosidases in the ER within 30&#x000a0;min and further modified with complex glycans in the Golgi apparatus within 1&#x000a0;h. In contrast, mono-glycosylated wtPrP remained unmodified further in the ER until 4&#x000a0;h after the chase. Despite the similarity in the rate of post-ER trafficking, the fully glycosylated PrP was produced at a higher level in Q212P cells than in wtPrP cells. This could be attributed to the fact that the post-ER trafficking was allowed only for the di-glycosylated form initially synthesized in pulse-labeled cells, noting that a higher level of di-glycosylated PrP was newly synthesized in pulse-labeled Q212P cells (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1C</xref>). Thus, an accelerated PrP maturation mediated by the Q212P mutation might be a plausible explanation for the observed increase in fully glycosylated Q212P.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Q212P mutation triggers the extracellular release of PrP</title><p id="p0135">In our pulse-chase analyses, we noticed that fully glycosylated PrP was decreased selectively in Q212P cells by &#x0223c;30% between 2&#x000a0;h and 4&#x000a0;h after the chase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Given the fact that lysosomes are the primary sites for the clearance and recycling of PrP, the logical explanation for the decrease in surface Q212P may be attributed to inhibitory endocytosis [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To investigate this idea, we employed a well-validated method [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] that has been previously used to determine the differential rate in lysosomal deliveries of wtPrP and mutant PrP inserted by RFP resistant to lysosomal acidic proteases. We reasoned that, by monitoring the level of free RFP in cells expressing RFP-inserted Q212P, we could verify the impact of the Q212P mutation on proteolytic endocytosis of PrP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). A combination of this assay with pulse-chase experiments revealed that RFP insertion did not perturb the general pattern of PrP synthesis and turnover; the newly synthesized wtPrP-RFP was fully glycosylated within 1&#x000a0;h after the chase and then endocytosed and processed into free RFP (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2A</xref>). The fully glycosylated PrP was expressed on the cell surface within 1&#x000a0;h after the chase, as deduced through its complete digestion by exogenously added trypsin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). In contrast, free RFP was protected by trypsin and increased progressively up to 4&#x000a0;h after the chase; however, its generation was suppressed by an inhibitor of lysosomal acidic proteases, bafilomycin A1 (BAF-A1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C, see also <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2B</xref>). Accelerated proteolytic endocytosis did not appear to be the sole reason for the reduction in surface Q212P owing to the unchanged level and rate of free RFP generation post its mutation (Fig, 2B, see also <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2A</xref>). This might be a reasonable explanation for the increase in accumulated Q212P accumulated at the cell surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Therefore, we aimed to identify an additional mechanism by which Q212P is selectively processed at the cell surface.<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Analysis of Q212P release into the extracellular space</p><p><bold>(A)</bold> The lysosome-restricted free RFP generation.

To test this hypothesis, we pulse-labeled cells, collected the conditioned media (CM), and examined whether the newly synthesized PrP was recovered from the CM by an RFP-specific antibody. As expected, newly synthesized PrP-RFP, but not free RFP, was selectively recovered from the CM of Q212P cells. Extracellular Q212P proved to be a fully mature form synthesized through the conventional secretory pathway, as revealed by its similarity in gel mobility to the Endo H-resistant surface PrP (of note, Endo H selectively cleaves simple modifications of N-linked glycans processed by ER enzymes) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D) and the inhibition of its secretion by monensin (of note, monensin prevents protein secretion from the medial to trans cisternae of the Golgi complex) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E). Thus, Q212P mutation might be able to catalyzes the extracellular release of surface PrP without affecting endocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>ADAM10 catalyzes Q212P shedding at the cell surface</title><p id="p0145">We aimed to identify the factor responsible for promoting the extracellular release of surface Q212P and first hypothesized that sheddase ADAM10, a surface metalloproteinase that proteolytically cleaves the ectodomain of surface PrP [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was a promising candidate. This hypothesis was supported by two notable preliminary results. First, surface PrP was shed by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S3A</xref>), a thiol-modifying reagent that is reported to activate sheddase ADAM10 [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Second, the extracellular Q212P level was decreased by GI254023X (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S3B</xref>), a potent inhibitor of ADAM10 [<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p id="p0150">To obtain more direct evidence, we established an ADAM10-disrupted (&#x00394;ADAM10) cell line using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Defective gene expression and protein elimination of ADAM10 were confirmed by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). This cell line was further engineered with inducible expression of stably integrated Q212P-RFP. We monitored the newly synthesized Q212P-RFP recovered in the cell lysates or the CM to determine whether ADAM10 was required for the steady-state shedding of Q212P. Comparative analysis of extracellular Q212P-RFP newly synthesized from pulse-labeled wild-type (WT) and &#x00394;ADAM10&#x000a0;cells showed a clear inhibition of Q212P shedding in &#x00394;ADAM10&#x000a0;cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B, left panel, see also <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). This inhibitory Q212P shedding conferred an increase in the level of surface Q212P but was not reversed by NEM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B, right panel, see also <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). In contrast, the general pattern of free RFP generation was changed neither by &#x00394;ADAM10 alone nor in combination with NEM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B), consistently suggesting that ADAM10 was not functionally involved in Q212P endocytosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B, see also <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S2A</xref>). In this context, NEM-induced PrP shedding differed from the steady-state Q212P shedding in two notable aspects. First, it was not specific for Q212P, and second, it inhibits PrP endocytosis as judged by the decreased level of free RFP during the chase.<fig id="fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Analysis of ADAM10-mediated Q212P shedding</p><p><bold>(A)</bold> ADAM10-deficient cells expressing Q212P-RFP were established using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (&#x00394;ADAM10) and verified by RT-PCR (left panel) and immunoblotting with ADAM10-specific antibody (right panel).

As expected, the newly synthesized Q212P* remained unreleased from the surface of the DTT-treated cells. Upon DTT withdrawal, the Q212P* was reversibly shed from the surface and increased in the CM with a proportional decrease in the surface level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). Accelerated endocytosis and ER stress were not involved in these reactions, as revealed by the unchanged free-RFP levels and failure to generate Q212P* by an ER stress inducer thapsigargin (Tg), respectively (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S5C</xref>). In a similar manner, we analyzed Q212P in the &#x00394;ADAM10&#x000a0;cells. Consistent with the observation in the WT cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C), Q212P* was also observed in &#x00394;ADAM10&#x000a0;cells treated with DTT and was more prominent than in WT cells. However, unlike WT cells, the inhibitory shedding of the Q212P* was hardly restored in &#x00394;ADAM10&#x000a0;cells, even by DTT withdrawal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D). This finding was a plausible explanation for the increase in Q212P* on the surface of &#x00394;ADAM10&#x000a0;cells. The redox-sensitive inhibition of Q212P shedding was, therefore, reversible as long as ADAM10 was active (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>E).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><label>3.6</label><title>Inhibitory Q212P shedding promotes cell proliferation</title><p id="p0180">Given that oligomer-prone PrP exacerbated neurotoxicity and neuronal degeneration [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], persistent Q212P shedding by uncontrolled ADAM10 activity could eventually be detrimental unless extracellular Q212P was efficiently eliminated by a clearance mechanism. In contrast, inhibitory Q212P shedding might be more favorable to cells as misfolded surface PrP can be endocytosed eventually into lysosomes for degradation. This was validated by the ability of &#x00394;ADAM10 to promote colony formation in single cells expressing Q212P (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). Comparable results were also observed in long-term cultures of mixed cells expressing fluorogenic PrPs and verified by the predominant visualization of &#x00394;ADAM10&#x000a0;cells expressing Q212P-RFP (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S6</xref>). These observations suggested a potential anti-proliferative effect of extracellular Q212P, with our results consistently demonstrating the efficient endocytosis of Q212P despite &#x00394;ADAM10 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). This was hinted by the sequential centrifugation of the CM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C) showing that the extracellular Q212P was mostly insoluble and precipitated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> (P100) and 200,000&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> (P200) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D).</p><p id="p0185">Intriguingly, ADAM10 was also detected in the CM. Extracellular ADAM10 was apparently released from the cell surface but appeared to be independent of Q212P shedding for the following reasons. First, this reaction was not Q212P-selective, as evident through the detection of ADAM10 in the CM of wtPrP cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D-left and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D-middle). Second, ADAM10 was recovered predominantly in S200 rather than P200, indicating that, unlike Q212P, it was mostly present in a soluble form (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D-middle and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D-right). Last, extracellular ADAM10 was the same in size as the surface form (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D-left). In addition, we detected Hsp 90, a major cargo contained in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes [<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], in the ADAM10-enriched S200 of both wtPrP and Q212P cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D-right). This result was in agreement with a previous report suggesting that ADAM10 is incorporated into EVs and spontaneously secreted [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p id="p0190">Besides Q212P and ADAM10, two small fragments were additionally detected in S200 by an RFP-specific antibody (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>D-right). Considering that RFP was inserted into the N-terminal region of PrP, these fragments were most likely those of the N-terminal PrP (i.e., N1) proteolytically processed by various proteases and liberated from the cell surface in soluble form. Even though one such typical protease responsible for this cleavage (i.e., &#x003b1;-cleavage) is ADAM10 [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], N1 fragments were still produced in &#x00394;ADAM10&#x000a0;cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>E). Therefore, ADAM10 was more actively involved in ectodomain shedding near the site of GPI-anchor addition in the C-terminus than &#x003b1;-cleavage within the central hydrophobic region of PrP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0195">In this study, we illustrated mutant-selective extracellular release of surface PrP by showing spatiotemporal differences in the metabolism and processing of PrP attributed to the catalytic activity of sheddase ADAM10. The new findings are twofold. One is the discovery of a disease-causing human mutation (Q212P) that promoted ectodomain shedding of surface PrP. The other is the molecular basis for the susceptibility of ADAM10-mediated Q212P shedding to environmental redox perturbations. Our intensive biochemical analysis combined with mutational analyses provided clues to several unresolved issues related to the peripheral pmQC aimed to remove ERAD-resistant misfolded GPI-anchored PrP (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>A working model depicting the role of ADAM10 in promoting Q212P shedding</p><p>On the cell surface, the PrP can interact with the cysteine-rich region of ADAM10, either catalytically or non-catalytically. Q212P mutation provides catalytic interaction of PrP with ADAM10, switching the conformation of the cysteine-rich region, allowing PrP to access the ADAM10 active site, and inducing its extracellular shedding. Under redox perturbation, inhibitory Q212P shedding induces the surface accumulation of oligomeric Q212P but is restored, albeit somewhat slowly, upon redox recovery as long as ADAM10 is activated. Nevertheless, cells prefer ADAM10-independent endo-lysosomal degradation to eliminate surface Q212P because it is more efficient than ADAM10-dependent extracellular shedding. This strategy renders cells more capable of fully digesting misfolded surface Q212P that may exert unexpected protein toxicity when released into the extracellular space.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0075">Fig. 7</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig></p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Steps susceptible to Q212P mutation during the PrP metabolism</title><p id="p0200">pmQC is a regulated process that limits the endocytic flux of misfolded PrP into lysosomes from the cell surface for degradation. This endocytosis is beneficial to cells as it reduces the burden of lysosomes owing to the misfolded PrP, therefore ensuring the safety of the endocytic pathway [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the physiologically relevance of this regulation was questionable, as all studies were focused on artificial mutants lacking one or both cysteine residues within PrP [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, we aimed to identify pmQC clients from &#x0223c;30 disease-causing PrP mutants that are reported to metabolize and process differently than wtPrP [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We, for the first time, reported the Q212P mutation that selectively increases fully glycosylated PrP.</p><p id="p0205">There are various possible reasons for the relative increase in fully glycosylated Q212P (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). First, glycosylation-defective subpopulations might be degraded by ERAD [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, this is least likely because PrP is synthesized with covalent attachment to the ER membrane via a GPI-anchor and poorly degraded by ERAD [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Second, the Q212 mutation might inhibit the endocytosis of misfolded PrP from the cell surface into the lysosome for degradation [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This did not appear to be the principal reason because the Q212P mutation did not interfere with lysosome-restricted free RFP generation in our analyses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Third, the Q212P mutation might enhance the rate of PrP transport to ensure the safety of compartments involved in the secretory pathway [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This was validated by the accelerated complex glycan modifications of Q212P compared to that of wtPrP in the pulse-chase analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). Last, the Q212P mutation possibly inhibited the release of surface PrP into the extracellular space. Unexpectedly, the extracellular release of newly synthesized PrP was rather triggered by the Q212P mutation but was insufficient to completely remove the misfolded PrP from the cell surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). These explanations allowed us to conclude that the rate of secretory trafficking (i.e., RESET) and extracellular release (i.e., pmQC) determine the surface level of pathogenic Q212P, as further discussed in Supplementary Note.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>Effect of modulation of ADAM10 activity on Q212P shedding</title><p id="p0210">Given the fact that the Q212P mutation promotes PrP shedding, we inferred that ADAM10 would interact with Q212P at the cell surface with a higher affinity than with wtPrP. However, their transient interaction on the cell surface posed a major challenge to validating this idea. Our attempt to stabilize the cell-surface interaction was able to successfully detect ADAM10 bound to PrP, but this interaction was apparently attenuated by the Q212P mutation. A logical situation supporting this observation would be a rapid release of surface Q212P from the cell surface immediately after the transient catalytic interaction with ADAM10. This may be key to the molecular basis of mutant-selective PrP shedding, as supported by the facts suggested in previous studies as follows.</p><p id="p0215">First, it is possible that the conformation of ADAM10 is switched from the resting state to the active state mediated by its interaction with Q212P. This idea was suggested by the model of ADAM10-mediated Notch proteolysis derived from the X-ray crystal structure of the mature ADAM10 ectodomain [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Most notably, the ADAM10 catalytic site adopts a closed and autoinhibited conformation in the resting state. At this stage, the metalloproteinase domain is partially closed by an intramolecular cysteine-rich domain, limiting the access to the active site. In contrast, upon ligand binding, the activated Notch receptor opens and directly contacts the ADAM10 catalytic site to promote cleavage. Substrate selectivity is, therefore, not only a cause of a typical interaction of the substrate and ADAM10 but also the conformation of the substrate-binding pocket of ADAM10 [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Likewise, the Q212P mutation may indicate an open conformation of this pocket, which is compatible with a potential mechanism of the mutant-selective PrP shedding of ADAM10.</p><p id="p0220">Second, disulfide exchange switches the conformation of the cysteine-rich region and modulates substrate access to the ADAM10 active site, governing the catalytic activity and substrate selectivity of ADAM10. This has been previously proven by the conformation-specific antibody 8C7, which binds to a conformationally active cysteine-rich domain and inhibits dynamic shuffling of the disulfide linkage with a thioredoxin CXXC motif [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. As predicted from the structure, inhibitory disulfide shuffling keeps the ADAM10 active site open and enhances its catalytic activity on the substrate, for example, inhibiting Notch activity [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In our study, for PrP, comparable results were observed by the exposure to the thiol-modifying reagent NEM, which inhibited dynamic rearrangement of disulfide exchanges; however, in contrast to the steady state, wtPrP was also shed at a similar efficiency to Q212P (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S3A</xref>). Although the structural basis for the opening of the ADAM10 active site by the Q212P mutation remains unsolved, our biochemical analyses allowed us to speculate that, similar to the actions of 8C7 and NEM, the Q212P mutation inhibited disulfide exchange in the cysteine-rich region, relieved ADAM10 autoinhibition, and catalyzed ADAM10 activity for PrP shedding.</p><p id="p0225">Last, Q212P shedding is also likely to be also regulated by tetraspanins (Tspans) that form microdomains where ADAM10 is predominantly localized [<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>]. There are 33 reported human Tspans (i.e., Tspan1-Tspan33) that interact with membrane proteins including cell adhesion, signaling molecules, and proteolytic sheddase such as ADAM10 to regulate their intracellular trafficking, lateral mobility, and cell surface clustering [<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Unlike the other Tspans, the TspanC8 subgroup (TspanC8s) has eight cysteine residues within the main extracellular region, which form structurally important disulfide bridges for inter-Tspan interactions and regulate ADAM10 activity [<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>]. The subgroup consists of six members (i.e., Tspan5, Tspan10, Tspan14, Tspan15, Tspan17, and Tspan33) and forms six different &#x0201c;scissor complexes&#x0201d; with ADAM10 that have distinct substrate repertoires [<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. One such notable member of TspanC8s is Tspan15 which has been identified to interact with ADAM10 and suggested as a potent regulator of ADAM10 proteolytic activity [<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. More recently, inhibitory PrP shedding has been observed in Tspan15 knockout mice [<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], suggesting the possibility that Tspan15 causes ADAM10 to release PrP from the cell surface. Although there is currently no definitive evidence to address the dynamic assembly and disassembly of the Tspan15-ADAM10-Q212P complex in Tspan microdomain, it is likely that Tspan15 and/or possibly the other members of TspanC8s modulate ADAM10-mediated Q212P shedding in the complex.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><label>4.3</label><title>Importance of regulation in cell and organism</title><p id="p0230">Given the vulnerability of Q212P to environmental redox perturbations, catalysis of sheddase ADAM10 appears to be a &#x0201c;double-edged sword&#x0201d; that, on the one hand, protects the cell surface from Q212P, but on the other, spreads misfolded Q212P to neighboring cells [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These opposing reactions must be fine-tuned via ADAM10 in a timely and cooperative manner, otherwise, Q212P accumulates either on the cell surface or in the extracellular space. Although we did not perform an in-depth investigation on the intrinsic properties of Q212P, our analyses in &#x00394;ADAM10&#x000a0;cells provided several valuable clues for a better understanding of the pathological/physiological significance of Q212P shedding mediated by its catalytic interaction with ADAM10.</p><p id="p0235">First, inhibitory Q212P shedding was observed as pro-proliferative. This effect was seen in &#x00394;ADAM10&#x000a0;cells expressing Q212P and confirmed by an increase in the size rather than the number of viable colonies grown from single cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, see also <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S6</xref>). In addition, it was not surprising that the cell surface accumulation of Q212P mediated by inhibitory shedding did not induce proteotoxicity, as it was determined to be similar to wtPrP in terms of detergent solubility and protease sensitivity (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S5A</xref>), the two typical indicators of proteotoxicity for PrP [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Upon release, the extracellular Q212P was expected to be deleterious on its own, as shown by its reduced solubility in the CM, but was diluted to ineffective concentration in the extracellular space, therefore, making it difficult to observe overt proteotoxicity. In contrast, while on the cell surface, Q212P only affected surrounding cells, it was rapidly endocytosed into lysosomes for degradation before exerting proteotoxicity. This might be a plausible explanation for the increased size of the viable colonies as a result of inhibitory Q212P shedding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="p0240">Second, ADAM10 served as a negative regulator of pmQC. This fact may be reasonable owing to Q212P's tendency to shed extracellularly in contrast to PrP*, a well-known pmQC substrate that is prone to rapid lysosomal degradation [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nonetheless, both Q212P and PrP* were assumed to be RESET substrates that were rapidly delivered to the cell surface from the stressed ER. During RESET, Q212P formed a complex with precursor ADAM10 (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S4A</xref>), while PrP* is known to interact with TMED10 [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, ADAM10 regulates the Q212P with two sequential functions with the precursor ADAM10 serving as a chaperone that shields misfolded Q212P during the post-ER itinerary [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and mature ADAM10 subsequently acting as a sheddase that mediates the proteolytic release of surface Q212P into the extracellular space [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, it can be concluded that ADAM10 participates throughout the secretory itinerary of Q212P, including RESET and pmQC, and allowed PrP accessing the cell surface via RESET to bypass pmQC and get released into the extracellular space (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). From a larger perspective, ADAM10 was worth considering as a proteostasis checkpoint to ensure the safety of the secretory and endocytic pathways from misfolded PrP (discussed further in Supplementary Note).</p><p id="p0245">Last, ADAM10 deserves significant consideration as a valuable therapeutic target for various human diseases. Besides PrP [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], more than 100 other substrates, including Notch receptor, APP, and cadherin family, are processed by ADAM10 [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. These substrates are important regulators of cell adhesion and receptor signaling, and their dysregulations are often associated with pathological progression in human diseases, such as brain disorders including Alzheimer's disease, prion disease, fragile X-syndrome, Huntington's disease; cancer including T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, glioblastoma, breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma; and immune disorders including psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infections, chronic liver inflammation, atherosclerosis [<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The role of ADAM10 substrates in these disease progressions suggests the potential of ADAM10 as a promising therapeutic target. For instance, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by deposition of pathogenic amyloid &#x003b2; peptide (A&#x003b2;) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP), an ADAM10 substrate. ADAM10 activation has been expected to inhibit disease progression in Alzheimer's disease [<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In addition to promoting ADAM10 activity, the therapeutic strategies aimed towards inhibiting its activity by targeting its active site have been tested in the field of synthetic small molecules. Several hydroxamate inhibitors that chelate the Zn<sup>2+</sup> of the ADAM10 active site, including GI254023X, have been screened and developed [<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, despite their high potential demonstrated through the cell and animal-based experiments, they are frequently withdrawn from clinical trials owing to insufficient selectivity, toxicity, and drug resistance [<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. These side effects may be attributed to the varieties of substrates and expression patterns of ADAM10, necessitating a better understanding of the functional consequences of various substrates shed by ADAM10. This requires intensive investigation of the expression, regulation, localization, and interacting partners of ADAM10 in cell culture and animal models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0250">This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the <funding-source id="gs3"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> (<funding-source id="gs4">NRF</funding-source>) funded by the <funding-source id="gs5">Ministry of Education</funding-source> (NRF-2021R1I1A2040258) and in part by <funding-source id="gs6"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100005006</institution-id><institution>Asan Institute for Life Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> (2021IL0001 and 2022IL0009).</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0255">S&#x02013;W.K.: Conceptualization, Experimental design, Data analysis, and Manuscript writing; Y&#x000b7;S.: Experimental investigation and Data analysis; K&#x02013;S.J., D.L., M.S., and H&#x000b7;Y.: Experimental investigation; and Y&#x000b7;S.: Idea and resource provision and Data analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0260">The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Balchin</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hayer-Hartl</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hartl</surname><given-names>F.U.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>In vivo aspects of protein folding and quality control</article-title><source>Science</source><volume>353</volume><issue>6294</issue><year>2016</year><object-id pub-id-type="publisher-id">aac4354</object-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braakman</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hebert</surname><given-names>D.N.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum</article-title><source>Cold Spring Harbor Perspect.

</p></notes></front><body><p>As a kid, I had frequent nosebleeds and bruising. Sometimes, I&#x02019;d have nosebleeds daily and need to apply pressure for 20&#x02013;30 minutes. That&#x02019;s what I was known for. As I got older, I&#x02019;d get bruises on my legs or arms. I always had a bruise somewhere.</p><p>When I had my periods, there would be clotting and gushing. If I was sitting and went to stand, I worried I would leak through my clothes. I&#x02019;d be terrified sometimes because I wouldn&#x02019;t know if what I had on would handle the transition to the bathroom. I recall once wearing a dress and leaking all over the floor. I missed work and school occasionally, but it&#x02019;s not possible to miss days that frequently. Instead, I&#x02019;d figure out what to wear, how to double up and where the nearest bathroom was.</p><p>I did not ask my doctor about my periods or about my bruising. I thought everybody bled like that. My normal was my normal.</p><p>I was diagnosed with &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d; von Willebrand disease (VWD) after a minor medical procedure when I hemorrhaged and had to be hospitalized for a week. I don&#x02019;t think I would have called it &#x0201c;mild&#x0201d; when I constantly worried about gushing or when I had to be hospitalized.</p><p>I was told to inform medical practitioners about my diagnosis before any procedures, but I got no management advice. I only began to learn more after I was referred to a bleeding disorder clinic, like using tranexamic acid to help when I bleed. I&#x02019;m better equipped now. I have someone to call, my medical alert bracelet, my FactorFirst wallet card<xref rid="b1-194e1137" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and my card from the bleeding disorder clinic that outlines my appropriate treatment plan.</p><p>Every time I&#x02019;ve informed somebody of my VWD, I&#x02019;ve heard, &#x0201c;It&#x02019;s fine. That&#x02019;ll be no big deal.&#x0201d; One time, I needed a polyp removed and asked my clinic if there was a recommended course of treatment. There was, but the gynecologist said I didn&#x02019;t need it. I felt like there was a battle about whether this was necessary. The clinic was successful at ensuring I had the appropriate treatment, but I remember feeling very nervous going into surgery with someone who wasn&#x02019;t happy. But I can tell you that it was the first time I&#x02019;ve ever left a day surgery on time without bleeding issues.</p><p>It would be phenomenal if general practitioners had the Self-Bleeding Assessment Tool<xref rid="b2-194e1137" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> to administer when they ask patients about bleeding. I got asked, &#x0201c;When was your last period?&#x0201d; but never, &#x0201c;What does your period look like? What is the amount?&#x0201d; For most menstruators, whatever bleeding you&#x02019;re experiencing feels normal to you. We need more resources, like heroixx.ca,<xref rid="b3-194e1137" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> to learn about bleeding disorders. &#x02014; Interviewee wished to remain anonymous</p><boxed-text position="float"><p>In Their Own Words provide extracts of interviews held between <italic>CMAJ</italic> staff and patients, families or clinicians.

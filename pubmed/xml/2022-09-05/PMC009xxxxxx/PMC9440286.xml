Past analyses of these emissions in India used deterministic emission factors and predominantly focused on methane emissions with reporting of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions remaining limited to a few sites. This study addresses these gaps via field measurements on 108 underground mines (out of a total 338) to evolve greenhouse gas reporting in this sector. Results show large heterogeneity across &#x0201c;degrees&#x0201d; of mines as categorized by the Indian government. In addition, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are found to be significant in shallower mines of lower gassiness. Overall, the emissions from underground mining have reduced from 2.6 to 8.3 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>e to 1.3&#x02013;3.6 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>e during 1980&#x02013;2019. These emissions might remain significant by 2050 under a 2&#x02013;2.5&#x000b0;C constraint or may decline below 100,000 t-CO<sub>2</sub>e under a 1.5&#x000b0;C constraint. We also discuss several generalizable outcomes and approaches to make inventories in this sector more robust.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">GHG inventory estimates are presented for Indian underground coal mining</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">CO<sub>2</sub> &#x02013; in addition to CH<sub>4</sub> &#x02013; may be significant in terms of fugitive emissions</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">Overall emissions have reduced because of a declining trend in underground mining</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">Generalizable approaches to improve estimates are discussed</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0025"><p>Energy resources; Energy policy; Energy management; Energy Modeling</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Subject areas</title><kwd>Energy resources</kwd><kwd>Energy policy</kwd><kwd>Energy management</kwd><kwd>Energy Modeling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p id="misc0010">Published: September 16, 2022</p></notes></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0050">Coal production in India has increased from 112 Mt in 1980 to 773 Mt in 2019, with a compounded average growth rate of 5.1% (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Coal, 2021</xref>). Although the Government of India&#x02019;s climate efforts are directed toward renewable energy expansion, they do not explicitly aim at a coal phase-out (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Roy and Schaffartzik, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Shukla et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, even in several stringent climate pathways, there is a substantial presence of coal albeit with strong mitigation measures such as CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage (CCS) (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Vishwanathan and Garg, 2020</xref>). The key thrust of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in India is that from coal combustion which contributes to two-thirds of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in India (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andrew, 2020</xref>). That said, fugitive emissions during coal mining activities are also a substantial contributor to global GHG emissions. Worldwide methane emissions from coal mining were around 957.3 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2020 and might further increase without key mitigation efforts (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">GMI, 2022</xref>). Top-down modeling results suggest that even under a strong 2&#x000b0;C transition pathway, these emissions would remain significant at around 300&#x000a0;Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>e until the end of the century (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kholod et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, appropriate bottom-up quantification and understanding of mitigation measures is an important activity as part of GHG inventory preparation for India, which is now the second largest coal producer after China.</p><p id="p0055">India&#x02019;s coal production has largely been dominated by surface mining and the share of underground mining has steadily gone down to 6% during this decade (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Coal, 2021</xref>). This decline in underground mining has been because of multiple reasons &#x02013; lower economic productivity, increased safety concerns, and low-cost extraction opportunities from shallow deposits (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Tripathy and Ala, 2018</xref>). That said, there is a consensus among industry leaders and other stakeholders that if Coal India&#x02019;s targets of 1 billion tonnes production by 2024 are to be realized, it can be only through an increase in underground mining (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Garg et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Tongia, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">US EPA, 2019</xref>). This thinking stems from the reasoning that production from low-hanging, shallow coal deposits has now plateaued. This means that increasing production from the current &#x0223c;750 million tonnes to the 1 billion tonnes target would entail an increase in underground production by 100 million tonnes in the very short term (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">The Economic Times, 2022</xref>). Although the socio-technical and regulatory challenges of such an increase are manifold, this article focuses on the GHG implications of underground coal mining in India.</p><p id="p0060">There are several considerations associated with GHG inventories of underground coal mining. First, the magnitude of the rate of emissions is significantly higher than surface mining. The amount of methane content in coal increases directly with the depth and, accordingly, deeper deposits emit 1&#x02013;2 orders of magnitude more methane when mined out (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2006</xref>). Second, the variability in the rate of emissions from such mines is also higher. Thus, if Tier 1 default emission factors are used for such mines, they tend to exhibit much larger deviation compared to surface mines (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2019</xref>). Third, although the emissions are higher, underground mining activities also present a significant mitigation opportunity in the form of pre-mining drainage of methane (or coal mine methane [CMM] recovery) (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Karacan et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). This could bridge some of India&#x02019;s scarce natural gas reserves while also reducing safety hazards during underground mining. In China, these efforts have already resulted in significant emission reduction and health co-benefits (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Finally, the most recent update to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology for fugitive methane estimations i.e., the 2019 IPCC Refinements indicates there may be a significant scope of emissions in the form of CO<sub>2</sub> from the ventilation air (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2019</xref>). These emissions result from slow oxidation of the exposed coal surface and their genesis is, accordingly, distinct from methane emissions.</p><p id="p0065">In view of these considerations, an update to India&#x02019;s underground mining activities is deemed necessary for accurate GHG reporting. Prior estimates for methane emission factors considered a single-point, averaged methane emission factor which did not account for regional variability (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Kumar, 2016</xref>). These emission factors, which have featured in the IPCC Emission Factor Database and used for India&#x02019;s national communications to the UNFCCC, could benefit from regional specificity, which could also be matched with coalfield-level mitigation opportunities. Moreover, because reporting of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal mining activities has been recommended by the IPCC guidelines only as recently as 2019, such published inventory does not exist to our knowledge.</p><p id="p0070">To bridge the data gaps mentioned above, this article seeks to present the distributions of underground mining emission factors associated with different categories and coalfields in India. These are combined with the time-series data on coal production to estimate the overall GHG emissions from such activities. Finally, a discussion of projected future inventory is presented to understand the extent to which these emissions may be reduced. The key novelty in this article is to improve the understanding of heterogeneity in emissions from coal mining, while also accounting for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from spontaneous combustion that have been neglected in the past. Although the paper discusses mining with respect to India, the discussion section also provides several generalizable outcomes to improve inventory activities globally.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><title>Description of study sites</title><p id="p0075">Coal in India occurs primarily in two formations &#x02013; the Gondwana formations and the Tertiary formations. The Gondwana formation accounts for &#x0003e;99% coal reserves in the country and are found in the south-eastern quadrant of the country. They span ten states spread over 64,000&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup>. The coals in this formation range from sub-bituminous to bituminous grade coal, including some prime coking coal in the Jharia coalfield (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Singh et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Tertiary coal deposits are found in the northern, southern and western part of the country, as well as in the northeastern states of Meghalaya, Nagaland, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh. Gondwana coals range from high rank in the Damodar Basin to low rank. Tertiary coals are generally low-to-moderate rank and some lignites (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="p0080">The names of the coal mines, their daily coal production, and company names are noted in the <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">supplemental information</xref>. Here, we discuss the reasons for selecting these mines as being representative of&#x000a0;national coal production data. The mines evaluated here included 81 degree-I mines, 14 degree-II mines and 13 degree-III mines. These mines represented 31, 20, and ~100% of all the active coal mines in the respective categories, based on the most recent compiled statistics of underground coal mines in India (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2022</xref>).</p><p id="p0085">From a coalfield-level perspective, our analysis included measurements at the 12 largest coalfields in terms of production (Raniganj, Jharia, East-Bokaro, Mand-Raigarh, Makum, Pranhita Godavari, Sohagpur, Ib Valley, Pench-Kannan, Bisrampur, Johilla, and Hasdeo). It may be noted that coalfields of higher gassiness (degrees II and III) are mostly present in limited coalfields &#x02013; Raniganj, Jharia, and East Bokaro in the Gondwana coal basin, and Makum coalfield in the Tertiary basins. This also covers &#x0003e;95% of the coal production from underground mines out of the 16 coalfields in India (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Vishal et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0090">Emissions are also determined by the type of mining: Longwall versus board and pillar, with longwall mining producing higher emissions. Around 98% of production in India occurs via the board and pillar method, and the rest are mined through the longwall method (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Nayak and Dalai, 2010</xref>). As such, most mines evaluated in our study are ones which are mined via the board and pillar method. That said, some prominent longwall mines (Moonidih, Kottadih, Kargali, Jhanjra, and Chasnalla) are included in this study. The depth cover of the Moonidih is over 600 m, and it is one of the deepest coal mines in India (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). It also produces high-quality coking coal, whereas most of the degree-I mines studied here produce higher-ash coal.</p><p id="p0095">The coal production data was collected from the statistics of the Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS), Government of India. These publications provide year-wise data for coal production in different categories of mines.

The summarized coal production from Indian underground mines is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Coal production from underground mines in India</p><p>Data source: Statistics of Mines in India Vol. I (Coal), (Various years), Directorate General of Mines Safety, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India.

As pointed out earlier, the DGMS categorizes mines as degree-I, II or III based on whether the rate of nominal emission is &#x0003c;1, 1&#x02013;10 or &#x0003e;10 m<sup>3</sup>/tonne of coal produced. Although this classification was initially made from the standpoint of mines safety, these have been routinely used for GHG inventories as well. Using our field measurements, we first calculated the emission factors for both CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> &#x02013; as reported in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>. It is evident that even the emissions within single degree of mining exhibit as much as two orders of magnitude when the 90% confidence interval (CI) is observed. It is essential that some outlier measurements are not considered here (discussed later). As such, we have used the interquartile range of the 50% CI as our default means of reporting uncertainty, unless specified otherwise. Another important observation is that CO<sub>2</sub> emission factor per tonne of coal mined is non-trivial and incorporating it provides enhanced robustness in GHG inventory practice. Also, because of fewer field measurements in the earlier studies, some higher-emitting mines skewed the emission factor. In fact, the CH<sub>4</sub> emission factors from the previous study are close to the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of the rate of emissions in this analysis.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Summary of estimates for CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emission factors across Indian underground coal mines (n&#x000a0;= 108), and comparison to the prior estimate</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>m<sup>3</sup>/tonne-coal<hr/></th><th colspan="3">CH<sub>4</sub><hr/></th><th colspan="3">CO<sub>2</sub><hr/></th></tr><tr><th>Percentile</th><th>Degree-III</th><th>Degree-II</th><th>Degree-I</th><th>Degree-III</th><th>Degree-II</th><th>Degree-I</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td>2.11</td><td>0.92</td><td>0.29</td><td>3.06</td><td>4.67</td><td>3.80</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>3.17</td><td>2.08</td><td>0.58</td><td>7.80</td><td>9.16</td><td>8.32</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>7.77</td><td>3.36</td><td>1.03</td><td>12.03</td><td>11.75</td><td>15.88</td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td>24.36</td><td>6.07</td><td>1.66</td><td>42.16</td><td>18.60</td><td>23.98</td></tr><tr><td>95</td><td>188.40</td><td>7.82</td><td>2.22</td><td>65.67</td><td>54.22</td><td>90.13</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted average</td><td>14.12</td><td>4.46</td><td>0.86</td><td>17.65</td><td>7.83</td><td>13.76</td></tr><tr><td>Previous estimate</td><td>23.68</td><td>13.08</td><td>2.91</td><td colspan="3"><italic>Not estimated</italic></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0125">While <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> summarizes the key emission factor trends, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref> shows the rate of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emission from the 108 individual mines surveyed in this study (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>). Several interesting trends are visible from <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Indicative range of the rate of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from mines of different degrees of gassiness</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0130">First, our analysis provides an important refinement to the magnitude and the quantified range of the emission factors. Results show considerable variability in the rate of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions not only across degrees of gassiness but also within each degree of classification as well. For instance, the rate of CH<sub>4</sub> emission (50% [CI]) for degree-III mines is in the range 3&#x02013;25 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal, thus showing an order of magnitude of variance. This variation is somewhat less pronounced in mines of less gassiness with the 50% CI for degree-II mines being 2&#x02013;6 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal and that for degree-I mines being 1&#x02013;2 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal. This large variation, particularly within degree-III mines, makes an important case for the tier-3 IPCC methodology followed in this study. Earlier work that was also reflected in India&#x02019;s national communications to the UNFCCC did not take into account these uncertainties and instead relied on a single point, deterministic emission factor calculated by taking the weighted average of rate of emissions across mines (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2022</xref>). Based on the lower number of mines considered in those measurements, they reflected a considerably higher emission factor than ones calculated in this paper. Thus, the emission factor calculated in our earlier work (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Kumar, 2016</xref>) calculated the emission factor for degree-III mines as 24 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal. In contrast, the weighted average for such mines calculated in this broader exercise is 14 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal. This difference is present in lower degree mines as well although the margin of deviation is less. Our estimation for degree-II mines is 4.5 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal and 0.86 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal, with corresponding emission factors from the previous work being much higher, i.e., 13 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal and 3 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal respectively. Accordingly, we conclude that a larger number of field measurements refine not only the variability but also the magnitude of emission factors by diversifying the types of mines surveyed for GHG measurement.</p><p id="p0135">An additional point worth noting for CH<sub>4</sub> emissions in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref> is some critical outliers that depict emission rate much greater than the 50% CI. For instance, the Tirap mine in Assam shows a rate of CH<sub>4</sub> emission &#x0223c;190 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal. These outliers are included in the weighted average presented in the previous paragraph. However, they do not considerably influence the overall emission factor or the 50% CI because the amount of coal produced for such mines is lower than 100 t-coal/day (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Saikia et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the large magnitude of the rate of emissions from these mines do not overly skew the overall metrics for CH<sub>4</sub> emission factor in this study and corresponding inventory calculation carried out later.</p><p id="p0140">The second novel feature of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref> is the reporting of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for &#x0003e;100 underground mines. To our knowledge, the only previous work produced for this for Indian mines was from our group wherein only three mines were surveyed from a single coalfield (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2019</xref>). Although these measurements were used as a basis for framing the default emission factors in the <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">IPCC 2019</xref> refinements, they were calculated at three underground mines within a single coalfield. Accordingly, the dataset here is statistically more robust and diversified. We find that even though the global warming potential in several mines is primarily induced by CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, the magnitude of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is significant. Thus, the 50% CI for the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is 8&#x02013;42 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal for degree-III mines, 11&#x02013;18 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal for degree-II mines and 8&#x02013;24 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal for degree-I mines.</p><p id="p0145">It should be noted that whereas higher degree mines show higher emissions, the rate of emissions is comparable across degree. This contrasts with the trend for CH<sub>4</sub> emissions where the inter-degree difference is quite significant and varies by almost an order of magnitude. We posit that this difference in the rate of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions occurs because of the difference in the genesis of the two GHGs in underground mines. CH<sub>4</sub> is produced during the coalification process itself and, therefore, higher-rank coal mines often have higher CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. This is illustrative of a larger maturity for the coal. On the other hand, CO<sub>2</sub> is produced through spontaneous oxidation of the coal surface due to passage of ventilation air. As such, the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> emission is primarily affected by the quantity of air itself (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2019</xref>). But the maturity of coal could also affect the oxidation kinetics. Coal with lower maturity tends to get oxidized faster and accordingly, could be associated with high rates of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. As illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>, several degree-I mines are associated with CO<sub>2</sub> emission rate greater than 50 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal.</p><p id="p0150">Based on the contrasting trends in CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> across degree of mines, it is worth estimating the proportion of each GHG to the overall inventory of the mining activity. Using a global warming potential of 28 for methane, we find that the share of methane emissions is predominantly high in degree-III mines and is higher than 90% in some mines with large production such as the Chasnalla colliery of the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL). As per our hypothesis, this mine is among the few in India producing prime-quality coking coal and is accordingly associated with a high share of methane emissions. Several degree-II mines also show similar trends with the share of methane emissions being &#x0003e;80%. Some mines with lower production rate do show about one-third of GHG emissions arising due to CO<sub>2</sub>. The share of CO<sub>2</sub> becomes progressively higher in degree-I mines with the share of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted from an average mine being 80% by volume. This is not skewed by the outliers in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref> and is rather characteristic of some of the larger mines. For instance, the Rajendra mine in the Sohagpur colliery produces 1300 t-coal/day and nearly 90% of the GHG emissions (by volume) from this mine are CO<sub>2</sub> emissions due to spontaneous oxidation.</p><p id="p0155">These measurements are similar to a study carried out in Brazil on two mines. In that study, these mines have methane emission rates comparable to an average degree-II and degree-I mine respectively. Their study shows that the share of CO<sub>2</sub> emission in the former is 33% while that in the latter is 77%. This forms the basis for an important conclusion from this article. Earlier inventory estimates based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and reported in most countries&#x02019; communications to the UNFCCC do not report CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Because our measurements and those from <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bonetti et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref> show a high share of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, it is imperative that governments include these emissions in their reporting to the UNFCCC. The share of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions compared to CH<sub>4</sub> is also important to understand mitigation opportunities. Although CH<sub>4</sub> emissions may be directly reduced using pre-mining drainage or concentrating methane in the ventilation air, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions may not directly be reduced and may require other offsets.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Coalfield-level trends in GHG emissions</title><p id="p0160">Although degree-level assessments are useful in making comparisons to prior inventory estimates, it is also an objective of this paper to assess the regional variability in GHG emissions. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> shows the average, along with the maximum and minimum rate of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for each coalfield considered in this study.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Coalfield-wise rate of emissions of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> per tonne of coal mined</p><p>The whiskers in the plot reflect the 95% confidence interval for each coalfield (2.5&#x02013;97.5 percentile), while the marker reflects the median.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p><p id="p0165">The average rate of methane emission for most coalfields is below 3 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal. This is because more than 95% of the operational underground mines in each coalfield are degree-I or degree-II mines which have lower methane emissions. Although the number of degree-III mines was higher before 2000, they have continued to be retired because of complexity in handling the safety operations of the mines. Methane (firedamp) explosion in several of the mines with high methane content has led to 53% of the coal mining causalities in India so far. Two prominent exceptions are noted here. The first exception is the East Bokaro coalfield where a majority of the underground coal is mined out from the Sawang colliery. This was among the initial contenders for degasification with an early project started in the 1980s (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hummel et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). However, even with drilling of 2m, large influx of methane and water was noted. Shortly thereafter, knowledge gaps led to the shutting down of the project. During five years of this project (1981&#x02013;1985), 480,000 m<sup>3</sup> methane was produced. Apart from the methane content itself, the rate of production was also considerably high. Thus, the East Bokaro coalfield is an important repository of methane, especially when considered along with the adjoining Asnapani block (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Hajra, 2018</xref>). Another exception is the Makum coalfield where the average rate of methane emission is 83 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal. As discussed in the previous subsection, this is because of the low coal production and complex geo-mining conditions which involve a disproportionately high amount of ventilation air.</p><p id="p0170">Although the average values are useful in delineating overarching trends, it is also important to note the maximum value of rate of emissions in several of these coalfields. Coalfields with high rate of methane emissions could translate to commercial opportunities for coal mine methane recovery and utilization. Apart from the East Bokaro coalfield which has already been discussed, we see comparably high values for the Raniganj, Jharia, and Sohagpur coalfields, which could prospectively be treated as mitigation opportunities. These coalfields are also characterized by suitable thickness, high saturation and appropriate permeability for gas extraction to be technically feasible.</p><p id="p0175">The rate of CO<sub>2</sub> emission shows similar trends as noted previously, wherein they do not necessarily follow the trend of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions due to different sources of genesis. We find that the average rate of most coalfields is close to 10 m<sup>3</sup>/t-coal. The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are accompanied with significantly less variability across coalfields. We also note that coalfields producing high-rank coal derive most of their GHG emissions from methane. Accordingly, both Raniganj and Jharia coalfields have &#x0003e;70% share of methane in overall GHG emissions while it is as high as 98% for East Bokaro coalfield. For most other coalfields, the average share of methane and CO<sub>2</sub> is equal in their overall GHG inventory. Thus, we reiterate the need for combined CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> field measurements during national inventory preparations. Significant variability in methane emissions also point to the need for region-specific measurements.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Historic and future emission inventory estimates</title><p id="p0180">The emission factors from <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> and the activity data from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> are combined to estimate the overall GHG emissions from underground coal mining activities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>). We find that the GWP-100 value was 2.6&#x02013;8.3 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>e in 1980 and this decreased to 1.3&#x02013;3.6 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2019. The reduction in the GWP-20 value is from 5.7 to 18.9 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>e in 1980 to 2.5&#x02013;7.4 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub> in 2019. Thus, the emissions attributable to such mines has more than halved in less than four decades irrespective of the time-horizon followed. This reduction in emissions is because of shift in mining operations from underground to lower-cost surface mining. In 1980, underground mining contributed to about 65% of the total 112 Mt coal production, which has now reduced to less than 6%. Even so, the total methane emissions from both the categories of mines are still comparable because of a much higher emission factor for underground mines.<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>GHG emissions from Indian underground coal mining activities</p><p>The results of our analysis are reported on the basis of the 100-year and the 20-year GWPs, and compared to the 100-year GWP analysis from the prior analysis (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Kumar, 2016</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr4"/></fig></p><p id="p0185">Because the upper-bound &#x02013; or the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile &#x02013; of the new emission factors is close to the deterministic emission factor of the prior analysis (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>), we find that the overall emissions are also comparable. The deviation between these two estimates remains between &#x02212;4 and 8%. As discussed before, this shows the importance of increasing the number of field measurements when calculating the emission factors. The use of prior emission factors was concentrated in mines with a higher rate of emissions and in fewer coalfields. This likely led to an over-reporting of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions. It may be noted here that the prior estimate was a 100% CH<sub>4</sub> as CO<sub>2</sub> emission factors were considered insignificant. In our newer estimates, CH<sub>4</sub> emissions are close to 60% of total emissions (when reported in the form of GWP-100), with the rest being in the form of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It is imperative to put these emission results in context. India&#x02019;s methane emissions rank fourth in the world, and totaling about 400 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>e. This represents 15% of the overall GHG emissions. Although these emissions are dominated by the livestock and agriculture sectors, the coal mining sector provides a low-cost opportunity for point-source mitigation. The emissions from agriculture and livestock are more dispersed, which reduces the potential of mitigation in these sectors (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Harmsen et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, a substantial portion of emissions from underground coal mining may be mitigated in degree-II and degree-III mines at net profits.</p><p id="p0190"><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> shows the projected results for emissions from 2030 to 2050. Several important trends are visible here. As stated before, if coal decline occurs (e.g., in the 1.5&#x000b0;C scenario), we may assume that methane emissions will also decrease significantly. Thus, in the 1.5&#x000b0;C scenarios would result in reduction of median GHG emissions below a 100 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>. It may be noted here that this trajectory is not inclusive of residual CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, which <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kholod et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref> have considered.

This is in line with the Government of India&#x02019;s policy statements to increase underground coal production by 100 Mt over the next five years. Thus, under a 2&#x000b0;C constraint, median GHG emissions from underground coal mines would increase beyond 10 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2030, before declining to about 1 Mt-CO<sub>2</sub>e in 2050. An increase in underground coal production would be accompanied with an increase in mitigation opportunities from Degree-II and Degree-III mines. Our assumption of 60% methane recovery potential from these mines indicates more than 50 kt-CH<sub>4</sub> that could be extracted via coal mine methane. This is about a quarter of India&#x02019;s current coalbed methane production from virgin reservoirs where coal mining has not occurred (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Singh, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Dhir, 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0200">The results of our analysis are useful in informing several key practices in GHG inventory preparation in the coal mining sector. First, emission inventories in the underground coal mining sectors have focused on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions over the last three decades and not necessarily on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This was, in part, because of safety and regulatory concerns to ensure reduced risks of accidents in underground mines (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee and Dhar, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>). This made reporting of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions relatively intuitive within the UNFCCC reporting standards. Our analysis shows that in several mines of low gassiness, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions may be very significant as well. While this CO<sub>2</sub> does not pose any safety risk, it is imperative to include it within inventory reporting, as recommended by the 2019 IPCC Refinements. Some past analyses did report these numbers but such measurements were carried out on fewer mines. For instance, the Government of Australia&#x02019;s 2015 inventory report provided CO<sub>2</sub> emission factors from 45 underground mines (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Commonwealth of Australia, 2015</xref>). In the peer-reviewed literature, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bonetti et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref> carried out CO<sub>2</sub> measurements over two mines in Brazil while <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Singh (2019)</xref> made these estimates for three mines. Across these studies, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been shown to be significant in underground mines of moderate gassiness.</p><p id="p0205">Second, the study also brings into focus the role of incorporating regional heterogeneity into GHG inventory. Past work in China has shown the significance of regional variability in such analyses (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). As <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> shows, there is a significant variance of CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in various coalfields. Use of a default, deterministic emission factor can ignore these variabilities. For instance, the upper bound of the CO<sub>2</sub> emission factors in the 2019 IPCC Refinements is 12.3 m<sup>3</sup>/tonne (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2019</xref>). However, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> shows that this is close to the median value for Indian underground mines and the upper-bound of the interquartile range is substantially higher. These deviations arise because of differences in geological conditions as well as operational conditions of mine ventilation. Accounting for such regional differences is essential to obtaining robust GHG inventories.</p><p id="p0210">Finally, inventory practice in the coal mining sector has evolved over the years. Underground coal mining emission factors have been reported by several countries on a Tier-3 basis, which follows a mine-by-mine estimation. Surface mining emission factors for India have also been calculated on a Tier-3 basis. Some studies have also attempted to estimate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from surface mining due to low-temperature oxidation (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Day et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Other countries such as the United States, where the share of surface mining is less, report these emissions on a Tier-1/2 basis. However, it is necessary to calculate other emission factors to account for the whole coal supply chain. For instance, several countries report the fugitive CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from abandoned coal mines. These calculations often have a different set of variables, which include the condition of the mine, i.e., whether it is flooded, sealed or venting. Although the Government of India has published an indicative list of 228 abandoned mines (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ministry of Coal, 2015</xref>), the condition of mines is unclear. As such, we recommend this as the next step in GHG inventories. Similarly, the 2019 Refinements also include a new category of fugitive methane emissions during coal exploration. This would depend on the amount of coal resource explored each year and the emission factor, that would need to be regionally determined. To our knowledge, there is no exhaustive study in this domain because the default emission factor is a thousand times less than the coal mining emission factor. Nevertheless, because of large coal exploration by several countries, it is imperative to improve the reporting of these emissions. Over 1980&#x02013;2019, the emissions from underground coal mining in India have largely decreased as coal production from such mines has decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). However, as further underground mining increases &#x02013; as per the Coal India Limited&#x02019;s projections &#x02013; it would likely result in higher emissions.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="p0215">The study used spot measurements instead of daily measurements, which would lead to&#x000a0;&#x000b1;20% error as emissions vary across time scales (both during different times of days, as well as seasonally during different months of the year) (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">UNECE, 2021</xref>). The mitigation potential estimated in this study is assuming a generic 60% recovery based on the literature. Future work can carry out detailed gas potential studies at specific mines and also incorporate continuous measurements at selected mines to reduce uncertainty here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>STAR&#x02605;Methods</title><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Key resources table</title><p id="p0225">

It is preferable to have continuous or daily measurements which entail the uncertainty of only&#x000a0;&#x000b1;2%. However, because of several reasons (including weather conditions), this was not possible. As such, we used spot measurements &#x02013; which are reported in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> of the SI. Based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, these might lead to uncertainty of&#x000a0;&#x000b1;20&#x02013;30% (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3.3"><title>Calculation of emission factors and overall GHG inventory</title><p id="p0305">Because the activity data is presented by categorizing into the degree of mines, we also calculated the emission factors for individual degree of mines. Particularly, the rates of emission from individual mines (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Data S1</xref>) were weighted on the basis of production, and the weighted average was used as the emission factor of the particular degree of mines. Because this study also characterizes the uncertainty, we also calculated the 50% (interquartile range) and 90% confidence interval associated with the emission factors. The activity data was then multiplied by the emission factors to obtain the historical trend in GHG emissions. These emissions are reported in both the 100-year and 20-year global warming potential values presented by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, which assume the CO<sub>2</sub> equivalence potential of fossil methane to be 28 and 84 respectively (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Pachauri et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3.4"><title>Projecting future emissions</title><p id="p0310">The obtained emission factors may be applied to project future GHG emissions from Indian underground coal mining activities. However, the activity data is speculative as coal production is subject to several competing factors. As described above, the government&#x02019;s plans indicate an increase in future coal mining based on privatization of coal mines. At the same time, modeling projections indicate rapid phase-down of coal over the next two decades if global temperatures are to be restricted to 1.5&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Clarke et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="p0315">We used the data from the IPCC&#x02019;s Sixth Assessment Report Database to adapt the future trends in coal production in India (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Byers et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). We considered three sets of scenarios where there is a 50% likelihood end-of-century temperature rise staying below 1.5&#x000b0;C (without overshoot), 2&#x000b0;C and 2.5&#x000b0;C respectively. These trajectories of coal production are compared to their relative levels in 2015. The IPCC Database does not differentiate between underground and surface coal production. Thus, we make some additional assumptions. The share of the three degrees of gassiness is assumed to the same as 2015 levels, where the share of degree-I mines is 84%, degree-II mines is 15% and degree-III mines is 1%. Historic data is used for the analysis because there is no data source projecting future coal production based on different degrees of gassiness. In contrast, scenarios with increased coal production are assumed to have 40% incremental coal production from underground mines. This is because of the government&#x02019;s stated target to achieve 100 Mt coal production from underground mines out of a total 250 Mt increase in the next five years.</p><p id="p0320">Methane emissions from Degree-II and Degree-III mines can be mitigated by recovery and utilization of coal mine methane, based on expert elicitation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Garg et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). In past studies, gas content has been used as a proxy to the amount of methane that be mitigated from such mines (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kholod et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Although our analysis did not particularly evaluate the gas content of the 108&#x000a0;mines, previous analyses have shown that the gas content may be &#x0223c;60% in an average gassy coal mine (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Hajra, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Panwar et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). As such, we have assumed that 60% of methane emissions may be mitigated from Degree-II and Degree-III mines in the form of CMM. The 60% estimate is noted in past works as the ratio of the gas content to specific emissions, i.e., the amount of emissions that can be mitigated through coal mine methane. Thus, we have assigned 60% to all scenarios not as a policy assumption, but instead as a technical parameter based on observed values in pilot and commercial-scale coal mine methane studies (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kholod et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Hajra, 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Andrew</surname><given-names>R.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Timely estimates of India&#x02019;s annual and monthly fossil CO2 emissions</article-title><source>Earth Syst.

I thought I might have broken something. The emergency department was busy, but the nurse and emergency physician were excellent. They realigned the bones in my right wrist, put me in a plaster cast and sent me home.</p><p>The fracture clinic was a different story. It was a large room with multiple stretchers and little privacy. Everyone wore scrubs so I couldn&#x02019;t tell who was who. A man walked up to me without introducing himself, pressed on my hand and fingers and then walked away. I remember saying to my husband, &#x0201c;I hope that was the doctor.&#x0201d; It turns out he was the orthopedic surgeon because he returned later to discuss treatment options. We decided against surgical management.</p><p>My cast was changed to a fibreglass one. I was sitting with an outstretched hand, thinking I was waiting for my discharge papers when the surgeon walked back in and &#x02014; without warning &#x02014; grabbed the back of my hand and pressed so hard that I fell to the side from the pain. My husband yelled, &#x0201c;What the hell?&#x0201d; as the doctor left. The cast technician later told my husband that sometimes they needed to do things without warning so that people didn&#x02019;t get anxious beforehand. I learned later when I requested my medical records that this pressing was called a &#x0201c;through the cast manipulation.&#x0201d;</p><p>I know some doctors may not be the friendliest but are very good at their jobs. However, my subsequent experiences were not much better. My hand was swollen and I couldn&#x02019;t move my fingers. The cast technician told me this was because I was noncompliant with hand exercises &#x02014; although no one had mentioned any exercises or physiotherapy to me. After my cast was removed, my surgeon told me I couldn&#x02019;t move my hand because I had complex regional pain syndrome and then discharged me without follow-up. My medical records indicated I was to be referred to a pain clinic.</p><fig position="anchor" id="f1-194e1140"><caption><p>Marianne on her farm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="194e1140f1" position="float"/><attrib>Photo by Marianne&#x02019;s husband</attrib></fig><p>This diagnosis confused me because I had no pain, just dramatic loss of function of my right hand. And if the diagnosis was true, what were the next steps? Three years later, I still have difficulty writing, typing and driving. Luckily, I could retire early from my job but that does not help with chores on my farm. I have been attending physiotherapy and my hand is slowly improving.</p><p>I don&#x02019;t think I got good care, but I don&#x02019;t have any recourse. I&#x02019;m left to deal with the remnants of this injury, wondering if this could have gone differently. I&#x02019;m sure this surgeon has seen thousands of patients. But I only have one right hand.</p></body></article>

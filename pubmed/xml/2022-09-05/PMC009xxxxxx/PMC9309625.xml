is mostly predicted by environmental factors, such as exposure to household
smoke and tobacco smoke. Sociocultural ideas shape the perception of parents
on the effect of tobacco smoke thus influence their behaviour on reducing
the smoke exposure on their child. The present study aimed to explore the
perceptions of parents of under-5-year-old children with pneumonia about the
effects of exposure to tobacco smoke.</p></sec><sec id="abs2-jphr.2021.2409"><title>Design and Methods</title><p>This qualitative study was conducted using a phenomenological approach. The

these children belong to developing countries. <sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> Pneumonia is the major cause of death from infectious diseases (15%) in
children worldwide makes it the global priority of intervention.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup>. The prevalence of pneumonia in Indonesia increased from 1.6% in 2013 to 2%
in 2018.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> Interventions in Indonesia focus on controlling the incidence of pneumonia by
increasing the case detection rate to 80%.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup> To reach this target, several health programs, such as the Integrated
Management of Childhood Illness Program (Manajemen Terpadu Balita Sakit, MTBS) and
Acute Airway Infection Control Program (Pengendalian Penyakit Infeksi Saluran
Pernapasan Akut, P2 ISPA), have been launched by the Ministry of Health; public
health workers and pediatric nurses are at the front line in these
programs.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
Pneumonia is often triggered by several factors, such as exposure to household
smoke, crowding, and parental smoking.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> Acute respiratory infection in children, particularly in Eastern Indonesia,
is caused by several environmental risk factors, such as prenatal exposure to smoke
and household pollution due to solid fuel use, in addition to mother/caregiver
experiences and non-exclusive breastfeeding.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr6-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup> Moreover, under-5-year-old children who have a smoker parent or who live with
a smoker have a higher chance of inhaling more than 40 carcinogens from tobacco smoke.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> Approximately 78% of women and children in 31 countries, including Indonesia,
are exposed to tobacco smoke at home, as revealed by their hair nicotine
concentration. The hair nicotine concentration is twofold higher in under-5-year-old children.<sup>

<italic toggle="yes">As this study identifies parents&#x02019; perception on the effect of tobacco
smoke, it is expected to underlie and shape the smoking prevention
intervention in the specific culturally-bound smoking behaviour such as in
Manggarai, Eastern Indonesia.</italic>
</p></boxed-text><p>Tobacco is one of the main substances used in every traditional ritual in Manggarai,
in addition to alcoholic beverages, betel leaves, and areca nuts.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Smoking is also considered a
norm among men in Manggarai,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr11-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup> as a result of which smoking behavior is common among these men. Previous
research has revealed that the perceptions of parents about the effects of tobacco
smoke are related to the parents&#x02019; ethnicity and smoking behavior.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr12-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> It is also important to notice that the harmful effects of tobacco smoke are
not only caused by direct exposure by smoke inhalation but also caused by indirect
exposure, <italic toggle="yes">e.g</italic>., by inhaling the residue and by being in contact
with a smoker; these effects may be very harmful to children.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> Thus, in order to modify smoking behavior, parents need to be convinced that
exposure to tobacco smoke includes indirect exposure as well.</p><p>Parent's perception and understanding on the effect of tobacco smoke is an important
first step of stopping tobacco exposure to the children. The previous research
highlighted that the majority of parents especially the smoker parents acknowledging
the danger of tobacco smoke but do not belief that tobacco smoke directly causes
illness to their children.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup> This is in line with other study that states parents perception on their
child's illness severity influence their motivation to stop smoking.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr14-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup> While in Manggarai itself, tobacco and smoking behaviour become the
significant part of culture and tradition,<sup>
<xref rid="bibr11-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup> addressing parent's perception towards its effect on their child health is a
vital part to protect their children of the harm in the social and cultural setting,
where tobacco smoke is evident. To stop the exposure of under-5-year-old children
with pneumonia to tobacco smoke, the perceptions of parents, especially in a culture
where smoking behavior is common (e.g., in Manggarai), need to be understood first
and then be modified. Understanding the perceptions of parents is significant
because in order to implement a proper nursing intervention for under-5-yearold
children with pneumonia in Manggarai, nurses have to explain culturally sensitive
and relevant care to the parents. The present study aimed to explore the perceptions
of parents of under-5-yearold children with pneumonia about the effects of tobacco
smoke in Manggarai, East Nusa Tenggara, Eastern Indonesia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jphr.2021.2409"><title>Design and Methods</title><p>The present qualitative study used a descriptive phenomenological approach to explore
the perceptions of parents of under-5-year-old children with pneumonia about the
effects of tobacco smoke. Phenomenology approach was used so the researcher able to
explore the participant's life experiences comprehensively, detailed flexible yet
consistent and coherent with participant's point of view.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr15-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</sup> Purposive sampling was used so that the researcher could focus on the unique
characteristics of parents of children with pneumonia in order to answer the
research question. The study participants were parents of under-5-year-old children
who were currently or ever hospitalized due to pneumonia. Parents of
under-5-year-old children whose pneumonia had worsened and who were currently
receiving intensive care were excluded from the study. The data collected through
the in-depth interviews and then analyzed using the Colaizzi method. Interviews were
performed from February to March 2020. Data achieve the saturation on the eleventh
participant; therefore, the data collection were stopped. In order to maintain data
rigour and trustworthiness, researcher apply member checking of the data analysis
draft to the participants and conduct data triangulation with the research
supervisor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-jphr.2021.2409"><title>Results</title><p>The participants were recruited by referring to the medical records at Dr. Ben Mboi

perceptions of parents of under-5-year-old children with pneumonia in Manggarai
about the effects of tobacco smoke. The perception of parents is a significant
predictor of children's health.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> The study participants had varied perceptions about the effects of tobacco
smoke. While many participants thought that tobacco smoke is dangerous, some of them
had positive views on smoking. The others stated that they lacked awareness about
the effects of tobacco smoke. The diverse perceptions about smoking behavior are
predicted by the different socio-demographic backgrounds and the parents&#x02019; smoking
status (smoker or non-smoker). <sup>
<xref rid="bibr16-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</sup></p><p>Parents who view tobacco smoke as dangerous are likely to prevent the exposure of
their children to tobacco smoke. It has been previously revealed that parents who
think that smoking behavior is dangerous tend to impose smoke-free home rules and do
not smoke around children.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>
On the other hand, some parents stated that cigarettes help them in their jobs and
to socialize with others. Smoking behavior has been identified to be an avoid kind
of coping mechanism used to overcome stressors in a previous study.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr19-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> In this study, the stressor identified by the parent was work pressure and
the need to interact. Thus, smoking behavior would hamper and decrease the efforts
of preventing the exposure of children to tobacco smoke.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr12-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> In the present study, the positive views of the participants on smoking
behavior by stating that smoking is acceptable and can be done anytime the smoker
wishes. Thus, the risk of exposure of under-5-year-old children with pneumonia to
tobacco smoke is increasing.</p><p>The participants expressed that they were less aware because of the lack of
knowledge, their working status, and not experiencing the direct effects of tobacco
smoke (e.g., children falling ill or getting hospitalized). A previous study proved
that the perceptions and awareness of parents about the effects of passive smoking
on children are influenced by the experience of health problems related to tobacco smoke<sup>
<xref rid="bibr17-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</sup> In another study, parents were provided information on the level of exposure
of their children, e.g., by measuring the levels of tobacco smoke exposure
biomarkers in the children's hair or urine, in order to increase the parents&#x02019; awareness.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr20-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup> Future studies need to focus on this important issue in order to increase
parents&#x02019; awareness about the exposure of children to tobacco smoke.</p><p>The participants realized the harmful effects of tobacco smoke on the respiratory
health of under-5-year-old children. This was reflected through their experiences of
their children being prone to illnesses, <italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, shortness of breath
and cough, after being exposed to tobacco smoke. The participants also stated that
their children were susceptible to being unwell because of their weaker immune
status. Exposure to smoke at home is known to be a predictive factor of the
incidence of pneumonia in under-5-year-old children.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr21-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
</sup> In addition to respiratory disorders, exposure to tobacco smoke can cause
chronic illnesses and other health symptoms, such as dizziness. Furthermore,
under-5-year-old children who are exposed to tobacco smoke at home, as revealed by
their hair nicotine concentration, tend to have higher systolic blood pressure and
lower highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) levels than those who are not exposed to tobacco
smoke (no nicotine detected in the hair). Thus, children exposed to tobacco smoke
have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. <sup>
<xref rid="bibr22-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
</sup></p><p>The participants also stated that tobacco smoke affects the health and well-being of
the family. Exposure to tobacco smoke at home reduces the physical, social,
economic, and psychological well-being of the entire family.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr23-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</sup> Tobacco smoke also endangers the health of the family, including that of
smokers, pregnant women, and passive smokers. Tobacco smoke poses a health danger to
all age groups, particularly babies, children, elderly individuals, and pregnant
women. It can have harmful effects, such as cancer, asthma attacks, and a lower
birth weight<sup>
<xref rid="bibr24-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</sup> The exposure of pregnant mothers to tobacco smoke is a predominant risk
factor for lower airway infection or wheezing disease.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr25-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
</sup> The study participants were found to have sufficient knowledge about the
effects of tobacco smoke on the health of the family.</p><p>Smoking behavior also hampers the financial condition. Some participants reported
that they had to sacrifice their daily meal at times in order to provide cigarettes
to their guest. Most cigarette consumers have a low socio-economic status and
education level; thus, they have a higher risk of exposure.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr26-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</sup> The reduction of smoking behavior in people with a low economic status can
increase their short-term financial status by approximately 2.5 times. Moreover, in
the long term effect, it can reduce the cost associated with chronic illnesses
caused by smoking behavior.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr27-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</sup> By reducing the exposure of children to tobacco smoke, families can avoid
financial losses due to children's healthcare costs.</p><p>Smoking behavior is common during every traditional rite in Manggarai. In the
Manggarai culture, cigarettes are served in every traditional ceremony, including
weddings or engagements; this is known as <italic toggle="yes">seng wali tuak agu rongko</italic>
(money for cigarettes and alcoholic beverages).<sup>
<xref rid="bibr28-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</sup> This normalized smoking habit is known to be prevalent in people with a low
education level and in smoker parents.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr29-jphr.2021.2409" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</sup> Thus, health workers, particularly pediatric nurses, need to comprehensively
provide health education not only to parents but also to the community. The
participants expressed finding it difficult to participate in traditional ceremonies
as they wanted to prevent their children from being exposed to tobacco smoke. The
participants&#x02019; social interaction with others, especially with smokers, was
interrupted; they stopped the interaction and began to feel anxious when interacting
with smokers. In order to be able to protect children, especially under-5-year-old
children with pneumonia, pediatric nurses should consider parents&#x02019; needs and devise
the appropriate strategy.</p><p>A limitation of the present study is that the interview was mostly done in the
hospital while child of the participants was hospitalized. In order to overcome
these difficulties, the researcher decided the time and place of the interview
according to each participant's comfort so that the participants felt free to
express themselves. Moreover, the study was conducted during the coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) pandemic, and given the restrictions in place, the researcher found it
difficult to directly contact the participants for data validation. Data validation
was performed through phone calls and chats. The present study has a qualitative
design. In order to be able to represent a wider population, a future quantitative
study of parent's attitude and behaviour on tobacco smoke should be performed.
Future studies should focus on increasing parents&#x02019; awareness by providing proof of
the exposure of children to tobacco smoke, <italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, by measuring the
biomarker levels in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec17-jphr.2021.2409"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The perceptions of parents of under-5-year-old children with pneumonia about the
effects of tobacco smoke were explored in the present study through the obtained
themes. Most participants viewed tobacco smoke as being harmful to the health of
under-5- year-old children and thought that it would lead to children's
hospitalization. The participants also mentioned various effects of tobacco smoke
and smoking behaviour on the children's health and on the health and well-being of
the family. Parents&#x02019; awareness about the effects of tobacco smoke can serve as the
foundation for interventions to protect children from being exposed to tobacco
smoke. The implication of this study toward pediatric nursing is that this study
highlighted the importance of nurses&#x02019; role to facilitate, communicate with and
educate parents through the consideration of the family's needs, conditions, and
cultural background.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The present study is funded by PUTI Grant from the Direktorat Riset dan Pengembangan,

Intramuscular (IM) injections deposit drug directly into skeletal muscle bellies, providing rapid systemic uptake due to the highly vascularized nature of this site. The potential to inject particulate or non-aqueous materials have also made IM injections useful for long-acting formulations. These attributes have supported a plethora of medicines being approved for IM administration. Despite these many approvals across multiple pharmaceutical categories, mechanisms that control drug release from the injection site, and thus its pharmacokinetic properties, remain poorly understood. Several pre-clinical <italic>in vivo</italic> animals have been used to model IM drug fate in patients, but these approaches have not consistently predicted clinical outcomes. This lack of a predictive <italic>in vivo</italic> model and no standardized <italic>in vitro</italic> tools have limited the options of pharmaceutical scientists to rationally design formulations for IM delivery. Here, we describe a novel, tractable <italic>in vitro</italic> model informed by dominant extracellular matrix (ECM) components present at the IM injection site. Three charge variants of green florescent protein (GFP) and the impact of three common formulation components were examined in an initial test of this <italic>in vitro</italic> model. A strongly positively charged GFP was restricted in its release from hydrogels composed of ECM components type I collagen and hyaluronic acid compared to standard and strongly negatively charged GFP. Introduction of commonly used buffers (histidine or acetate) or the non-ionic surfactant polysorbate 20 altered the release properties of these GFP variants in a manner that was dependent upon ECM element composition. In sum, this <italic>S</italic>imulator of <italic>I</italic>ntra<italic>M</italic>uscular <italic>I</italic>njections, termed SIMI, demonstrated distinct release profiles of a protein biopharmaceutical surrogate that could be exploited to interrogate the impact of formulation components to expedite novel drug development and reduce current dependence on potentially non-predictive pre-clinical <italic>in vivo</italic> models.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="ab0010"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="f0040" position="anchor"><alt-text id="al0040">Unlabelled Image</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="ga1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0005">An initial <italic>in vitro</italic> format to model drug release from the intramuscular (IM) injection site release parameters is described.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Mixtures of collagen type 1 (Col1) and hyaluronic acid within a semi-permeable chamber were tested.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Green fluorescent proteins with varied charge profiles were used to model different biopharmaceutical properties.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">A Col1-dominated hydrogel format provided an initial validation of this <italic>in vitro</italic> IM injection site approach</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intramuscular</kwd><kwd>Biomimetic</kwd><kwd>Hydrogels</kwd><kwd><italic>In vitro</italic></kwd><kwd>Drug fate</kwd><kwd>Modelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="ks0010"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>Collagen type 1, Col1</kwd><kwd>Interstitial fluid, ISF</kwd><kwd>Hyaluronic acid, HA</kwd><kwd>Simulator of intramuscular injections, SIMI</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0025">The intramuscular (IM) administration route is a common parenteral alternative to the oral delivery of pharmaceuticals that show poor physiochemical stability in, or limited uptake from, the gastrointestinal tract. The IM injection deposits formulations directly into skeletal muscle bellies, where diffusion through fascial planes of the skeletal muscle organ precedes uptake into the systemic vasculature or lymphatics (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Newton et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Ogston-Tuck, 2014</xref>). In general, drugs delivered by IM injection are formulated for immediate absorption using rapidly diffusing aqueous formulations that takes advantage of the highly vascularized nature of this tissue (<italic>e.g.</italic> epinephrine) or as long-acting injectables (LAIs) which gradually release drug in a controlled manner over weeks or months (<italic>e.g.</italic> haloperidol decanoate) (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Whyte and Parker, 2016</xref>). Despite the large number of drugs approved by regulators for IM injection, there is limited knowledge of how these drugs interact with the IM environment, <italic>i.e.</italic>, drug fate (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">McCartan et al., 2021</xref>). At present there are no standardized <italic>in vitro</italic> tools available to researchers to investigate IM drug fate for the generation of descriptive pharmacokinetic (PK) data; the development of IM-injected drugs relies heavily on pre-clinical <italic>in vivo</italic> models, but these <italic>in vivo</italic> models fail to consistently predict human clinical outcomes (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">McCartan et al., 2021</xref>). Acellular <italic>in vitro</italic> modelling offers the potential for powerful, in-depth investigations that can address specific drug fate hypotheses in tractable experimental formats (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">McCartan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="p0030">IM-injected drug formulations distribute along the fascial planes established by the endomysium (space between individual muscle fibres) and perimysium (encapsulating individual muscle fibres into fascicles) within a skeletal muscle belly (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Darville et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Evertz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Groseclose and Castellino, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Kalicharan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kameni Tcheudji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Probst et al., 2016</xref>). The endomysium and perimysium compartments contain lymphatic and vascular capillaries, nerve fibres, and a variety of cells including adipocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages, but is dominated by an extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of large macromolecules that organize and stabilize skeletal muscle fibres. A predominantly serum-derived interstitial fluid (ISF) is assumed to flow through the endomysium and perimysium. As very little of an IM-injected drug formulation enters individual muscle fibres, events of interaction with and dissemination through ECM elements of the endomysium and perimysium would dominate their fate following administration. Whilst the exact components and concentrations of ISF are still debated, ECM elements of the endomysium and perimysium are well documented with fibrillar collagen type 1 (Col1) being the dominant protein component (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Gordon and Hahn, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Loukas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Purslow, 2002</xref>) and hyaluronic acid (HA) being the predominant non-protein element (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Piehl-Aulin et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">Previous efforts to model the IM injection environment have employed hydrogels composed of such ECM elements, including thiol-modified HA and glycosaminoglycans, and even decellularised/reconstituted animal skeletal muscle ECM (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Narayanan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Prestwich, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Wassenaar et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, &#x0201c;micro-tissues&#x0201d; and whole excised muscle tissue have previously been described as <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> IM-injection models, respectively (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Afshar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Napaporn et al., 2000</xref>). Such models, however, are technically and financially challenging to use in large scale assays over long time scales. As such, acellular <italic>in vitro</italic> methodologies are typically favoured for their advantages in cost-effectiveness, user-friendliness, and tractable experimental design. For such approaches to be of value to pharmaceutical scientists, a tractable model that allowed for the rational addition or exclusion of specific ECM and formulation components is required. Such a model should include components that emulate critical elements of the IM injection site that might control drug binding and a means to monitor drug release from that environment over time under physiologically relevant conditions (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">McCartan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Here, we have explored an initial design for a novel <italic>in vitro</italic> tool to model IM-specific drug fate, termed the <italic>S</italic>imulator of <italic>I</italic>ntra<italic>M</italic>uscular <italic>I</italic>njections (abbreviated to SIMI). Col1 and HA were used in hydrogel formats to model potential interactions between the predominant protein and non-protein ECM materials that would be experienced by formulation components following their IM injection. These ECM-like hydrogels were contained within a semi-porous non-specific cuvette, which in turn was suspended in an ISF-mimic buffer solution to represent the infinite sink of the body following uptake into vascular or lymphatic capillaries. Initial tests using this format were performed using green fluorescent proteins (GFP) having three distinct global charge profiles alongside clinically relevant excipients (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Lawrence et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Pramanick et al., 2013</xref>). These GFP variants were selected as a surrogate drug to provide a means to readily visualise the injection bolus formed within the hydrogel and to simultaneously examine the impact of drug charge on drug-ECM binding events. Diffusion of these GFP variants from the ECM-hydrogels into the infinite sink compartment were monitored for rapid (first several hours) and extended release (release at 24&#x000a0;h) to examine the impact of biopharmaceutical properties and formulation components on drug fate. This prototype system showed that release of a material from a hydrogel mimicking the IM injection site was affected by ECM composition and that this release could be monitored by measuring drug entry into the surrounding ISF-mimic solution. By following this diffusion over time, descriptive PK profiles of an injected drug and/or formulation materials could be obtained. These studies support the SIMI model as a potential <italic>in vitro</italic> model to screen IM-focused formulations for impact of ECM components on drug fate following injection.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Hydrogel generation</title><p id="p0045">Bovine Col1 solution (Sigma C2124-50ML) and HA (Sigma 53,747-10G) were used in hydrogel preparations. 0.01&#x000a0;M HCl, prepared in double-distilled water (<sub>dd</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O), was used to dilute Col1 solutions that were neutralized with 0.1&#x000a0;M NaOH prepared in <sub>dd</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O. 10&#x000d7; concentrated PBS stocks were prepared with NaCl (1.37&#x000a0;M), KCl (27&#x000a0;mM), Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>&#x02022;7H<sub>2</sub>O (95&#x000a0;mM), KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (18&#x000a0;mM) and sodium azide (30&#x000a0;mM) in <sub>dd</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, adjusted to pH&#x000a0;7.4 with HCl.

Across the range of 0.1 to 100&#x000a0;rad/s frequency, the tan(&#x003b4;) values decreased greatest between 0.1 and 10&#x000a0;rad/s for both Col1/HA and Col1 hydrogel formats. Past the 10&#x000a0;rad/s frequency point, the tan(&#x003b4;) values remained stable. Results from both hydrogel formats overlapped across the entire frequency range studied, indicating similar elastic properties of both Col1/HA and Col1 hydrogel formats. Amplitude sweeps were used to measure hydrogel viscoelasticity, where energy applied to the hydrogels was increased by enlarging the oscillation amplitude (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). Here, the Col1/HA format was less elastic than the Col1 alone format when considering G'. This could be because the extended chains of HA, extending throughout the Col1 network, reduced the amount of free space available for elastic deformation of Col1. The linear viscoelastic limit, however, was equal for both hydrogel formats at approximately 0.0016&#x000a0;rad (marked by a vertical dashed line; <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). This indicated similar viscoelastic behaviour between the two hydrogel formats. Lastly, flow sweep assays characterized how these hydrogels &#x0201c;flowed&#x0201d; under increasing stress (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The data indicated that both hydrogel formats possess the non-Newtonian characteristic of shear thinning: as the degree of stress applied to the hydrogels increased, viscosity decreased. The Col1/HA format hydrogel exhibited lower viscosity than the Col1 alone format under shear rates of 0.1&#x02013;10 1/s. At all other measured shear rate points, the data from both hydrogel formats again overlapped.

Instead, the SIMI is intended to examine the fate of IM-injected therapeutics where the fate of these materials would be potentially affected by interactions with acellular inter-fascial ECM components that dominate these regions. This ECM is primarily composed of Col1, imparting strength and a framework for interactions with other ECM elements. HA is one of most prominent of these other elements, functioning as a biological lubricant to retain water and minimize friction between fascial layers during dynamic muscle movement (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">McCartan et al., 2021</xref>). Based upon their relative abundance, these ECM components were identified for this initial modelling of the IM injection site.

Buffering elements used in the current SIMI format were also non-physiological: phosphate (presented in PBS) in the hydrogel, and HEPES in the ISF-mimic solution. These buffers were selected for their properties and ease of use in generating a pilot tool. PBS has been frequently applied in Col1-based hydrogel design and shown to be chemically stable in a pH&#x000a0;7.4 solution. HEPES is also chemically stable in aqueous settings, with a pKa of 7.5 that was ideal to maintain pH&#x000a0;7.4 in the ISF-mimic buffer.

However, there is no guarantee that specific IM environment components, such as bicarbonate, will impact drug fate outcomes. Candidate components for inclusion in the SIMI compartments must therefore be evaluated accordingly.</p><p id="p0150">The two hydrogel formats we describe here were assessed for their rheological properties. Both hydrogel formats were indeed similar in viscoelasticity and non-Newtonian behaviour; shear thinning is well-documented in biomaterial hydrogels and has been exploited in injectable-hydrogel drug-delivery strategies (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Loebel et al., 2017</xref>). However, the 3.2&#x000a0;mg/mL Col1 content used in rheological analysis was too high for injection modelling in the SIMI, as injected materials were immediately ejected along the needle bore. This frustrated efforts to form an injection bolus, which was desired in the SIMI to reflect <italic>in vivo</italic> observations of injected pharmaceuticals forming bolus deposits (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Darville et al., 2016</xref>). Reducing Col1 content to 1&#x000a0;mg/mL produced stable hydrogels that were sufficiently malleable for bolus formation and dissemination through the hydrogel matrix following injection of a formulation. By sampling the ISF-mimic buffer over 24&#x000a0;h, we established the release profiles of charged GFP variants, in several formulations, from boluses formed in the hydrogel environment. The hydrogel matrix of Col1 and HA may influence movement of molecules by steric hindrance; bulkier drugs, such as macromolecules, may be retained longer at the injection site while small molecules could more freely move through the Col1/HA network. Of these components, Col1 is noted to be positively charged at physiological pH (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Andrade et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Li and Katz, 1976</xref>), whilst HA is negatively charged (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Travis et al., 2001</xref>). These distinctly charged components may influence diffusion of strongly charged molecules and macromolecules through electrostatic interactions, further retaining molecules in the hydrogel matrix after injection or encouraging their diffusion from the matrix and into the infinite sink compartment.</p><p id="p0155">In the SIMI, we observed that GFP-std and GFP-neg generally displayed negative exponential curve release profiles. These indicate a decay of GFP presence at the injection site as GFP diffuses through the hydrogel matrix (with no distinct inhibitory interactions) before releasing into the ISF-mimic buffer. These non-formulated GFPs were prepared for injection with no buffering agents; there are no other potential interactions occurring other than GFP with the hydrogel and ISF-mimic systems. However, GFP-pos generally released slowly from the injection site, independent of hydrogel composition, suggesting specific interactions with the Col1 matrix. In this regard, several proteins, including von Willebrand factor and various growth factors, specifically bind Col1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Cauble et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Romijn et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p id="p0160">Clear differences were observed in the release profiles of GFP over the 24-h window of analysis that were assumed to describe interaction parameters between the distinct physical properties of the GFP variants and Col1 or Col1/HA matrices. Interestingly, we observed a similar initial release of all non-formulated GFP variants at 10&#x000a0;min post-injection that did not reflect the extent of release after 24&#x000a0;h. The reason for this phenomenon is unclear but could be due to pressure introduced into the hydrogel by the injection process. This added force may have been sufficient to transiently overcome the interactive forces between the injected GFP variant and the hydrogel components that ultimately defined the extent of release observed after 24&#x000a0;h. As materials then &#x0201c;settle&#x0201d; post-injection, the injection-pressure force should diminish. Interactions with the hydrogel matrix would dominate and reflect interactions that control diffusion away from the bolus site. Interestingly, the extent of this initial &#x0201c;burst&#x0201d; observed at 10&#x000a0;min post-injection was dramatically altered for studies that examined additions of L-histidine, acetate, or PS20. Here, the release at 10&#x000a0;min post-injection directly correlated with the extent of release after 24&#x000a0;h, suggesting that the presence of these additives affected the extent of initial interactions during this &#x0201c;burst&#x0201d; between the GFP variant and the Col1 or Col1/HA hydrogels in a way that overcame the added pressure associated with the injection event. This impact of excipient presence on this initial &#x0201c;burst&#x0201d; and 24&#x000a0;h release was further investigated by exploiting the tractable nature of the SIMI.</p><p id="p0165">By using Col1/HA and Col1 only hydrogel formats, we examined the individual roles Col1 and HA in determining drug fate outcomes for these GFP variants. Absence of HA in hydrogels did not affect non-formulated GFP-std release, but reduced release when formulated with L-histidine, acetate or PS20 (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref>A 7B). Yet, non-formulated GFP-pos release over 24&#x000a0;h was doubled in the presence of HA (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>E, F). Such data indicated how HA can affect IM drug fate outcomes, dependent on drug characteristics and distinct from the effects of Col1. Excipients, too, appeared to alter this interaction dynamic between GFP and the hydrogel matrix, dependent on GFP charge and/or hydrogel composition. For example, L-histidine increased GFP-pos release from both hydrogel formats, while acetate or PS20 reduced release. Indeed, acetate generally reduced diffusion of all GFP variants in both hydrogel formats. Whilst the mechanisms of these observations are unclear, a histidine-rich glycoprotein can block Col1 interactions with endothelial cells (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Roche et al., 2015</xref>) while sodium eugenol acetate (derived from sodium acetate) inhibited Col1-dependent platelet aggregation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1996</xref>). Hypothetically, L-histidine and acetate may directly interact with Col1 networks, reducing interactions with GFP. Distinct in function from L-histidine and acetate, surfactant PS20's ability to stabilize proteins at interfaces may have led to altered protein-hydrogel matrix interactions. Whilst PS20 generally reduced the release of all GFP variants in all hydrogels, such stabilisation may be significant for strongly negative macromolecules: GFP-neg formulated with PS20 in Col1/HA hydrogels exhibited expedited diffusion away from the injection site (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). Yet, PS20 decreased release of GFP-neg compared to non-formulated GFP-neg in Col1 only hydrogels (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>D), indicating HA-surfactant interplay. Presently, the mechanisms relating to such outcomes with PS20 (and indeed L-histidine and acetate) are not clear. However, the SIMI was designed to explore such examples of drug fate outcomes in a fully tractable manner, to establish how excipients modify drug behaviour post-IM administrations. As such, with further development and application of the SIMI, such mechanisms could be elucidated.</p><p id="p0170">In formulation design, the long-term stability of a drug is essential to allow storage of the product before administration. As such, formulations may use low concentrations (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) of buffering excipients, as used in this study, for maintaining non-physiological pH (<italic>i.e.</italic>, pH&#x000a0;6). However, such designs are not intended for buffering drug formulations <italic>in vivo</italic> post-administration. These non-physiological pH conditions will likely rapidly transition to physiological pH post-injection, and are modelled here in the SIMI (<italic>i.e.</italic>, &#x003bc;M quantities of formulation excipient, <italic>versus</italic> overwhelming mM quantities of phosphate in the hydrogel). While the initial change in pH of the environment is likely to be inconsequential, the results of this change may have a role in drug fate. Transitions to physiological pH may alter the overall charge state of excipients with respect to their pKa values, thereby possibly influencing potential interactions with the local IM environment.</p><p id="p0175">While this initial version of the SIMI model has begun to uncover the role of drug, excipient, and injection site properties and their interplay in drug fate outcomes, it must be acknowledged that further work is crucial in establishing its true value in modelling human IM conditions. Evaluation and validation of the SIMI by <italic>in vitro</italic> &#x02013; <italic>in vivo</italic> correlations (IVIVC), and indeed mathematical modelling of drug PK, have yet to be undertaken. While IVIVC data could be explored to establish <italic>e.g.</italic>, equivalence of the SIMI to standard <italic>in vivo</italic> models such as rats, it is the ability to model human PK outcomes that is paramount for SIMI model applications. Such validation can indeed be conducted using published human PK data from the PharmaPendium database (Elsevier), which contains data for a wide range of IM-approved pharmaceuticals, from small molecules to proteins, in an array of quick or slow releasing formulations. Examples of drugs with such PK data available have been tabulated (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">McCartan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p id="p0180">The GFP variants used in these studies provided a surrogate set of molecules to emulate protein biopharmaceuticals with distinct charge properties. In this initial SIMI model format, the potential for charge interactions between biopharmaceuticals and ECM components were examined and found to dominate release characteristics from the hydrogel matrices composed of Col1 and HA. Furthermore, our with these GFP variants demonstrated how formulation excipient choices might impact IM drug fate outcomes. Further development of SIMI technologies would permit further exploration of potential events affecting drug fate <italic>in vivo</italic>, such as whether individual excipients directly interacting with IM site components, such as Col1. This kind of descriptive data, informing behavioural trends of injected materials, may be useful to inform rational drug formulation design for IM administration.</p></sec><sec id="s0100"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0185">IM drug fate is an area of limited knowledge, despite the increasing application of IM pharmaceuticals in the clinic. Here, we have described an initial effort to establish a tractable <italic>in vitro</italic> tool for investigating parameters of drug fate after IM administrations. From the data presented and discussed here, the SIMI appears to allow discrimination of distinct biopharmaceutical properties and can evaluate specific formulation excipients that may impact drug performance at the IM site in a tractable manner. Using the model, we have begun to identify pharmaceutical and formulation properties that can affect drug fate and to determine how specific ECM components of the IM injection site can likewise impact drug fate. Such an approach could be useful in formulation screening studies to predict the likely performance of a pharmaceutical formulation to expedite research efforts by reducing dependence on costly, time-consuming <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments that may not actually be productive of outcomes in humans. Thus, after obtaining these initial proof-of-concept outcomes, efforts to use human ECM components and use a more physiologically relevant ISF composition are being contemplated for a next generation SIMI model.</p></sec><sec id="s0105"><title>Funding sources</title><p id="p0190">Adam McCartan is a recipient of a <funding-source id="gts0005">GSK/EPSRC</funding-source> co-funded studentship (EP/P510403/1).</p></sec><sec id="s0106"><title>Research data</title><p id="p0191">All data supporting this study is openly available from the University of Bath Research Data Archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.15125/BATH-01146" id="ir0006">https://doi.org/10.15125/BATH-01146</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0195">The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:</p><p id="p0200">Adam McCartan reports financial support was provided by <funding-source id="gts0010"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source>.

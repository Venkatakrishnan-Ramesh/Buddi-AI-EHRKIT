Glioma is a lethal and aggressive cancer with high mortality and morbidity. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), gliomas are divided into four grades: pilocytic astrocytoma (WHO grade I), diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II), anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade III), and glioblastoma multiform (WHO grade IV) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kristensen et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Louis et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Despite improvements and advances made in recent years in glioma treatment options, including surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis of patients with glioma is still dismal (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Silantyev et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). It has been estimated that the 5-year survival rate of patients with glioma is extremely low, which is even less than 10% for those with advanced WHO grades (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Wen et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is essential to uncover the detailed molecular mechanisms in glioma tumorigenesis and metastasis.</p><p id="p0040">GINS family has four members, GINS5, GINS1, GINS2, and GINS3 (Go, Ichi, Nii, and San in Japanese for five, one, two, and three, respectively, in English). GINS1, also known as Partner of SLD Five 1 (PSF1), forms a heterotetramer complex with SLD5, PSF2, and PSF3. Through recruiting Cdc45 and DNA polymerase, this complex is essential for the initiation and elongation of DNA replication (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chang et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Gambus et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kanemaki et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). GINS1 was initially found to be predominantly expressed in highly proliferating cells instead of mature cells. Later on, it was found that GINS was involved in the tumorigenesis of various cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Toda et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Although growing evidence has shown that the GINS complex serves as a switch between quiescence and proliferation of glioma cells inside and outside the perinecrotic niche (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kimura et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), the specific function of GINS1 and the underlying mechanism in glioma remain largely unknown.</p><p id="p0045">Topoisomerases play a vital role in DNA world, being essentially involved in administering DNA topology (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Wang, 2002</xref>). Topoisomerases show elevated levels of expression in tumor cells. There are total of six topoisomerases in humans, which include two enzymes in each subfamily: IA (TOP3A and TOP3B), IB (TOP1 and mitochondrial TOP1), and IIA (TOP2A and TOP2B) (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cuya et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hou et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) is an enzyme involved in DNA maintenance and repair as well as cell proliferation (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Albadine et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). By creating a DNA-linked protein gate through which another intact DNA duplex passes, TOP2A mainly supports DNA decoiling, chromosome segregation during cell cycle anaphase, and DNA replication that are necessary processes for cell proliferation (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Schindlbeck et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), so TOP2A is also a cell proliferation marker in normal and neoplastic tissues (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Shvero et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). TOP2A plays a critical role in glioma cell proliferation and migration (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Song et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Deguchi et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). In malignant cells, TOP2A protein overexpression might reflect the proliferative advantage of these cells and qualitative alterations caused by malignant transformation and dedifferentiation (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Nakopoulou et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>). The immunohistochemical (IHC) method for <italic>in situ</italic> determination of TOP2A has been extensively validated to reflect the exact enzyme activity closely in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human tissues, leading to the prognostic and predictive importance of this test in other neoplasms (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Shamaa et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Posttranslational modifications of TOP2A, including ubiquitylation, SUMOylation, and phosphorylation, have been implicated in the regulation of TOP2A localization, turnover, and activities (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nitiss, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Vos et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). TOP2A ubiquitination by BMI1/RING1A or APC/C-Cdh1 promotes its degradation, while its ubiquitination by BRCA1 stimulates its decatenation activity and its proteasomal degradation (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Alchanati et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Eguren et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lou et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Shinagawa et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). The reversal posttranslational modification of ubiquitylation, deubiquitylation, is also important in the regulation of TOP2A function (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Despite the importance of ubiquitylation on TOP2A function and its steady-state levels, the mechanisms that mediate its deubiquitination in glioma cell proliferation and migration have not yet been identified.</p><p id="p0050">Ubiquitination is a posttranslational protein modification process that attaches single or multiple ubiquitin molecules to a target protein and affects its stability and function. Ubiquitin conjugation is mediated by the sequential action of three enzymes, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin ligases (E3s) (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</xref>). Lysine (K) 48-linked polyubiquitin chains are the best-studied ubiquitin chains that target proteins for proteasomal degradation, whereas some other ubiquitin chains, such as the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, can mediate nondegradative functions (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Sun, 2009</xref>). The specificity of protein ubiquitination is regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligases, which exist in large numbers in mammalian cells and mediate substrate recognitions (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Ubiquitination is a reversible reaction since the ubiquitin chains can be cleaved by a large family of ubiquitin-specific proteases, termed deubiquitinases (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Reyes-Turcu et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Zou et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Deubiquitinases can have specificity for both protein substrates and ubiquitin chains, thereby bringing in a different level of diversity in the regulation of ubiquitination. Deregulation of the deubiquitination process is frequently associated with tumorigenesis (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sun et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Mevissen and Komander, 2017</xref>). Among deubiquitinases, ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) is a member of the largest subfamily of cysteine protease deubiquitinases (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Mevissen and Komander, 2017</xref>). USP15 was previously reported to regulate TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and cancer cell survival. USP15 is aberrantly regulated or mutated in many human cancers, including glioma (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Vos et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Inui et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Eichhorn et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). However, the detailed function of USP15, particularly in the regulation of glioma cell proliferation and migration, has remained unclear.</p><p id="p0055">In the current study, we revealed that GINS1 was significantly upregulated in glioma cells and tissues.

We then compared GINS1 expression level between four human glioma cell lines and one normal human glial cell line, HEB by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. We found that GINS1 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in four human glioma cell lines, T98G, U251, U373, and A172, compared with HEB (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;2</xref>B and 2C). Next, we sought to examine the expression level of GINS1 first in four pairs and then in 80 pairs of our human glioma tissue and adjacent noncancerous tissues that we collected. GINS1 expression levels detected by Western blotting was increased more significantly in four human glioma tissue samples, compared with levels in four adjacent noncancerous tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). Furthermore, RT-PCR and Western blot analyses were utilized to detect GINS1 expression in 80 paired glioma and adjacent noncancerous tissues. The expression patterns of GINS1 between these 80 paired samples were found to be similar to that of four paired samples. The expression level of GINS1 is positively correlated with the tumor clinical stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;2</xref>E and 2F). In order to examine the spatial expression level of GINS1, we next used tissue microarrays and IHC to analyze the protein level of GINS1 between glioma tissues and normal brain samples. Similar to the mRNA results, the IHC staining intensity of GINS1 protein was positively correlated with the tumor clinical stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>G). GINS1 protein expression in glioma tissues was also higher than that in matched adjacent noncancerous tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>H). Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival analysis from TCGA and CGGA databases showed that patients with glioma with high GINS1 expression had poorer overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and disease-free survival rates (DFS) than patients with glioma with low GINS1 expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;2</xref>I&#x02013;2K and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>A&#x02013;S1C).

The clinicopathological analysis indicated that age and tumor stage were also associated with the GINS1 variable (chi-square test, p&#x000a0;= 0.001). In contrast, cell differentiation grade of glioma and gender exhibited no significant correlation with GINS1 expression level (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).

However, the specific regulatory mechanism signifying these effects is still unclear. Therefore, we performed affinity purification, silver staining, and LC-MS/MS assays to identify GINS1-associated proteins. The results revealed that TOP2A was a potential GINS1-interacting protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A) and verified by immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B), co-immunoprecipitation analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C), and GST pull-down experiments of immunoprecipitated samples (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>D). Detailed results from the mass spectrometric analysis are provided in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#x000a0;S4</xref>. These experiments suggested that GINS1 physically interacts with TOP2A. TOP2A is an enzyme that controls the DNA topology and plays a critical role in glioma cell proliferation and migration (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Albadine et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Song et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Deguchi et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we examined whether GINS1 exerts oncogenic effects on glioma cell proliferation and migration in a TOP2A-dependent manner. To explore the role of GINS1 in regulating TOP2A expression, we examined TOP2A protein levels in cells by varying GINS1 expression levels. GINS1 depletion significantly decreased TOP2A protein level in U251 cells, whereas GINS1 overexpression considerably elevated TOP2A protein levels in A172 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>E). Notably, no statistically significant changes in TOP2A mRNA levels were observed between these groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>F), which suggests that GINS1 modulates TOP2A expression posttranscriptionally. Similarly, exogenous GINS1 expression in HEK293T cells dramatically elevated exogenous TOP2A protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>G). In addition, GINS1 expression levels were positively correlated with TOP2A protein levels in four glioma clinical specimens and glioma cells of five cell lines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;5</xref>H and 5I). Then, we speculated that GINS1 might regulate the degradation pathway of the TOP2A protein. The autophagolysosome and ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome pathways are the main protein degradation pathways, so glioma cells were treated with ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome and autophagolysosome pathway inhibitors MG132 and chloroquine diphosphate (CQ), respectively. The results showed that MG132 could, to a certain extent, reverse GINS1 regulation of TOP2A protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>J). The TOP2A abundance in glioma cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX), a <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis inhibitor, was detected to examine whether GINS1 regulates TOP2A protein stability. GINS1 overexpression in A172 cells significantly increased the stability of TOP2A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>K). Accordingly, the silencing of GINS1 in U251 cells greatly destabilized the TOP2A protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>L). The role of GINS1 in TOP2A ubiquitination was further identified. In the presence or absence of MG132, enforced GINS1 expression inhibited TOP2A ubiquitination, whereas GINS1 silencing promoted TOP2A ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;5</xref>M and 5N).

GINS1 mainly serves as a relevant factor of DNA replication and is unlikely to act directly as a deubiquitinase to mediate TOP2A ubiquitination. Therefore, it was speculated that some&#x000a0;deubiquitinases might be responsible for the TOP2A ubiquitination induced by GINS1. mRNA microarray analysis was conducted using total RNA isolated from U251 shCtrl- and U251 shGINS1-transfected cells (n&#x000a0;= 3), and USP15 was screened as the top of the differentially expressed deubiquitinase genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A). Then, the influence of USP15 on TOP2A ubiquitination was identified. The results revealed that USP15 significantly diminished TOP2A ubiquitination, suggesting that USP15 might be&#x000a0;a&#x000a0;potential TOP2A deubiquitinase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B).

Moreover, USP15 knockdown enhanced the TOP2A inhibition induced by GINS1 silencing and USP15 overexpression promoted the upregulation of TOP2A expression induced by GINS1 overexpression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;6</xref>E and 6F). Next, the&#x000a0;effect of USP15 on TOP2A protein expression was examined. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>G, TOP2A depletion in U251 cells significantly reduced USP15 protein expression.

Furthermore, the impact of USP15 on TOP2A ubiquitination was assessed. USP15 overexpression significantly promoted the endogenous ubiquitination of TOP2A in A172 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>G). We further investigated the interaction between USP15 and TOP2A. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that endogenous USP15 and TOP2A bound to each other in A172 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>H). We also assessed the impact of&#x000a0;USP15 on TOP2A ubiquitination. Overexpression of USP15 significantly reduced the&#x000a0;endogenous ubiquitination of TOP2A in A172 cells. Accordingly, in the presence or absence of&#x000a0;MG132, silencing endogenous USP15 promoted TOP2A ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;6</xref>I and 6J). Moreover, overexpression of USP15 markedly reduced K48-linked ubiquitination, but not K63-linked ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;6</xref>K and 6L). Therefore, USP15 interacts with TOP2A and prevents its K48-linked ubiquitination. The above findings showed that TOP2A regulation by GINS1 was dependent on USP15-mediated deubiquitination in glioma cells. In addition, USP15 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of GINS1 silencing on proliferation and migration ability of in U251 cells, whereas USP15 knockdown impaired the&#x000a0;stimulatory effects of&#x000a0;GINS1 overexpression on proliferation and migration ability of A172 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;6</xref>M&#x02212;6P). Consistently, USP15 shRNA impaired the protein levels of&#x000a0;MMP9, N-cadherin, and Vimentin, but recovered E-cadherin expression in GINS1-overexpressing A172 cells, while the USP15 plasmid restored the protein levels of MMP9, N-cadherin, and Vimentin, but attenuated E-cadherin expression in GINS1-silenced U251 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>Q). Overall, these results revealed that&#x000a0;GINS1 promotes glioma cell proliferation and migration by USP15-mediated deubiquitination of TOP2A.<fig id="fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>GINS1 promotes glioma cell proliferation and migration by USP15-mediated deubiquitination of TOP2A</p><p>(A) Microarray analysis of mRNAs was performed with RNA extracted from U251 shCtrl and U251 shGINS1 cells.</p><p>(B) Ubiquitination assays of endogenous TOP2A in HEK293T cells co-transfected with HA-TOP2A, Flag-Ub, and USP15.</p><p>(C) Western blot analysis of the protein levels of GINS1 and USP15 in normal brain cells (HEB) and glioma cell lines (T98G, U251, U373, and A172).</p><p>(D) Western blot analysis of the protein levels of GINS1 and USP15 in clinical glioma specimens and human glioma cell lines.</p><p>(E) Western blot analysis of the protein levels of GINS1, TOP2A, and USP15 in GINS1-silenced U251 cells transfected with USP15 shRNA.

Thus, the expression and correlation of TOP2A and USP15 in clinical glioma specimens were examined.

Furthermore, the TCGA and CGGA survival data from Kaplan&#x02013;Meier Plots revealed that patients with glioma with high TOP2A or USP15 expression had poorer overall survival (OS) rate, progression-free survival (PFS) rate, and disease-free survival (DFS) rate than patients with glioma with low TOP2A or USP15 expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;7</xref>E&#x02013;7J and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>C&#x02013;S4H). These observations suggested that higher TOP2A and USP15 expression reflected a poor glioma prognosis.

This study explored whether GINS1 was upregulated in glioma cells and specimens. High expression of GINS1 predicted an advanced clinical grade and poor survival probability. Subsequent loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> showed that GINS1 significantly promoted cancer cell proliferation and migration, indicating the carcinogenic role of GINS1 in regulating glioma progression. Consistent with these results, recent studies have revealed that GINS1 serves as an oncogene to induce breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Toda et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Notably, the underlying mechanism by which GINS1 functions as a glioma proliferation and migration promoter is to physically interact with TOP2A, while USP15 directly deubiquitinates TOP2A.</p><p id="p0105">TOP2A is an enzyme that controls and alters DNA topologic states. TOP2A plays a crucial role in proliferation, metastasis, tumor recurrence, and metabolism and it is strictly controlled at the transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Albadine et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). In response to cellular stress, TOP2A protein levels change rapidly, primarily dependent on protein stability regulation (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Shvero et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Enhanced TOP2A expression was found in several cancers, including glioma (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Albadine et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Schindlbeck et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Shvero et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Song et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Deguchi et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). In our study, we found that TOP2A mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in glioma tissues compared to those in adjacent normal brain tissues, that higher TOP2A expression reflected a poor glioma prognosis and that TOP2A overexpression promoted cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, the key findings of this study showed that GINS1 physically interacts with TOP2A, while GINS1 induces glioma cell proliferation and migration in a TOP2A-dependent manner. GINS1 overexpression significantly increased TOP2A protein levels to promote glioma cell proliferation and migration. Although GINS1 did not function as a deubiquitinase to impede TOP2A ubiquitination, we identified USP15 as the deubiquitinase that interacted with and directly deubiquitinated TOP2A.</p><p id="p0110">USP15 belongs to a subfamily of deubiquitinases and is a widely expressed deubiquitinase that has been implicated in diverse cellular processes in cancer (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Reyes-Turcu et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). USP15 has been shown to deubiquitinate receptor-activated SMADs and TRIM25 and antagonize Parkin-mediated mitochondrial ubiquitination, and USP15 regulates the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway and is a key factor in glioblastoma pathogenesis (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Eichhorn et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pauli et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Inui et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).

Here, we identified USP15 as a deubiquitinase that interacted with and deubiquitinated TOP2A directly. Surprisingly, prior studies suggest that USP15 regulates TOP2A to maintain genome integrity, which is in agreement with our results (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fielding et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Our data also revealed that USP15 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in glioma tissues compared to those in adjacent normal brain tissues, that higher USP15 expression reflected a poor glioma prognosis and that USP15 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, USP15 knockdown reversed the TOP2A inhibition induced by GINS1 silencing and the upregulation of TOP2A expression induced by GINS1 overexpression. USP15 overexpression significantly reduced the endogenous ubiquitination of TOP2A, and silencing endogenous USP15 promoted TOP2A ubiquitination. Importantly, similar to other deubiquitinases (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), we found that USP15 deubiquitinates K48-linked TOP2A ubiquitination. In addition, USP15 overexpression reversed the inhibited proliferation and migration ability of glioma cells induced by GINS1 silencing in U251 cells, whereas USP15 knockdown impaired the elevated proliferation and migration ability of glioma cells induced by GINS1 overexpression in A72 cells.

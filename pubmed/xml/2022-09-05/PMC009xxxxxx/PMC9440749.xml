Moreover, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Saudi Arabia recommends vaccinating people at risk against influenza to minimise co-infection risk with SARS-CoV2. Therefore, this study aims to assess the Saudi population&#x02019;s knowledge, attitude, and practice toward influenza vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on seasonal influenza vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s2002"><title>Methods</title><p>This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey in Saudi Arabia between July to August 2021.

Co-infections of influenza viruses with SARS-CoV-2 at this time of the year were a big concern for public health. A report that examined the clinical outcomes of co-infection of influenza viruses with SARS-CoV-2 in the UK showed that SARS-CoV-2 co-infections with influenza viruses were significantly associated with an increased need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Therefore, there was emerging public awareness worldwide to vaccinate against influenza viruses. However, due to the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is believed the COVID-19 pandemic may positively or negatively affect the decision-making for influenza vaccination. Therefore, this study aims to assess the Saudi population&#x02019;s knowledge, attitude, and behaviour toward the influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on seasonal influenza vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Study Design and Sampling Strategy</title><p>This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using a web-based survey questionnaire in Saudi Arabia between July 15 and August 2, 2021.

In addition, participants were invited to complete the questionnaire through a survey link sent to social media platforms. Since all participants volunteered to participate in the study, they were not required to provide written informed consent. However, we clearly explained the study&#x02019;s aim at the opening of the invitation letter. Finally, participants accessed the survey and completed it if they decided to participate.

This is the first study assessing seasonal influenza awareness and the importance of vaccination among the general population in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Regarding demographic factors associated with the high knowledge of the influenza vaccine, the knowledge score declined in the elderly age group in this study. This finding supports the results of a previous study from Jordon conducted on the elderly (65+) that reported meagre influenza vaccination rates for the elderly, and the level of knowledge and attitude towards influenza vaccination was low.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> However, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health recommends annual seasonal influenza immunisation for everyone over 50 years old.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>These findings reinforce the notion that the most significant barrier to a lifetime immunisation practice is the lack of knowledge noticed in the elderly. Furthermore, patients underestimate the severity and impact of influenza, making them reluctant to seek a vaccine.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In our research, the educational level significantly impacted knowledge scores. As a result, participants with a higher educational level have seen a substantial rise in their knowledge scores. Similarly, Lu et al found that higher education was associated with correct knowledge about the influenza vaccination.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> These findings support intervention programs to raise awareness among those groups. Finally, efforts to better educate those with lower levels of education about the importance of influenza vaccination may improve vaccination rates.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the seasonal influenza vaccine, our study reports that most participants believe that encouraging people to acquire the COVID-19 vaccine would not directly enhance their awareness. That would explain the hesitancy in receiving the influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, our data analysis showed that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the influenza vaccine during the COVID-19 pandemic by 1.5-times compared to the previous years. Conversely, a prior study by La Vecchia et al indicates that attitudes about influenza vaccination have proven to be more favourable in the 2020 season.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Another study in Canada showed that influenza vaccination uptake and intention to take the vaccine among Canadians aged 50 and over increased during the 2020/2021 season compared to the prior year.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A possible explanation for a decrease in the number of people receiving the influenza vaccine might be that people tend to misunderstand the safety of receiving both COVID-19 and influenza within a short period. Moreover, a strong relationship between applying preventive measures guidelines and reducing influenza infection cases has been reported in the literature.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Around 88% of our study population believe that primary preventive measures such as wearing masks and avoiding close contact in the COVID-19 period help reduce the number of influenza infections. In addition, a study done in Korea revealed that Alongside the reduction in diagnosed cases of COVID-19, they found a substantial decrease in influenza activity.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, the representation of the population is a major limitation of convenience sampling; however, given the objectives of this study and the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, in which a large proportion of people are working from home due to lockdowns and other governmental restrictions, we believe the study&#x02019;s findings can be generalised to the Saudi population. Second, the questionnaire was prepared specifically for Arabic readers, challenging those who do not speak the language. Third, the data collected through a self-reported survey may have recall bias.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic had influenced the general population&#x02019;s intention to vaccinate against seasonal influenza. However, the possible factor associated with a decreased willingness to receive the influenza vaccine is a lack of knowledge of the importance of influenza vaccination. The trend of vaccine hesitancy is often related to new information or newly defined vaccine risk, especially with COVID-19 time, which increases the risk for re-emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, equipping healthcare providers with the knowledge circulating in the community to correct any misinformation at the community level. Moreover, an extensive awareness campaign is needed to emphasise the importance of receiving the influenza vaccination and other recommended vaccine on social media. Thus, education, improving public awareness and regulating social media content will enhance the hesitancy to receive the influenza vaccine.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0006"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Moghadami</surname>

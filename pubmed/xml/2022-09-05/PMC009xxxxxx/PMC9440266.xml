Therefore, this study aimed to identify educational needs for preventing unscheduled hospitalizations due to severe irAEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 159 consecutive patients with lung cancer who received programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in 2020. We evaluated the frequency, severity, and unscheduled hospitalization due to irAEs based on the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor use. Educational needs were assessed based on initial symptoms, reporters, telephone consultation, and the time lag between symptom onset and hospital visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Among 159 patients evaluable for irAEs, 73 (45.9%) experienced 91 irAEs during the study period. Seventeen patients (10.7%) required unscheduled hospitalization due to severe irAEs after a median duration of 4.1 days from symptom onset, and 52.9% visited hospitals after telephone consultations from caregivers. Pneumonitis (10 events) was the most frequent irAE requiring hospitalization, followed by adrenal insufficiency (three events). The type and severity of irAEs varied based on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The frequency of severe irAEs requiring hospitalization was high in patients who received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for advanced lung cancer. The early detection of severe irAEs may be possible through education focusing on common irAEs that are potentially severe. Patients and caregivers should be aware of the importance of reporting slight changes in symptoms after PD-1/PD-L1 therapy initiation in a timely manner. Healthcare professionals need to acknowledge common irAEs and be qualified to implement systematic telephone triage of irAEs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Caregivers</kwd><kwd>Programmed cell death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Immune-related adverse events</kwd><kwd>Patient education</kwd><kwd>Telephone triage</kwd><kwd>Neoplasms</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Newly emerged immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) improved the progression-free and overall survival of patients with various cancer<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and have been incorporated into the current standard of oncologic care.

IrAEs were defined as adverse events confirmed to be related to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors by the attending physicians based on onset timing, symptoms, laboratory data, imaging studies, and responsiveness to immunosuppressive treatment.

Furthermore, after more than a one-week time lag, the patients were diagnosed with severe pneumonitis at scheduled hospital visits. The remaining eight events were all unscheduled visits triggered by reports made by individuals other than patients.

The median number of days from symptom onset to hospital visit was one day (range, 0&#x02013;11). Two severe-irAE events required hospitalization after the discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 therapy: one patient had pneumonia, and the other had adrenal insufficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0085">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to uncover the detailed clinical course of severe irAEs, including symptom onset, reporters, and delays, among patients with lung cancer receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. First, we found that 11% of patients with advanced lung cancer receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors required hospitalization because of severe irAEs, with pneumonitis being the most frequent, followed by adrenal insufficiency. Second, severe irAEs were often detected during unscheduled hospital visits triggered by reports from caregivers after a several-day time lag from symptom onset. Third, frequent irAEs and their severities varied depending on the mode of PD-1/PD-L1 usage, that is, single-use, combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, or maintenance use after chemoradiotherapy.</p><p id="p0090">An overview of the incidence of severe irAEs shows that one in every 10 patients required irAE-related hospitalization. A previous study reported a lower proportion of severe irAEs than this study in patients with lung cancer receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in clinical trials.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> As for hospitalization due to irAE, there are some studies reporting a similar rate to our study.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Educational needs of patients and family caregivers</title><p id="p0095">The importance of early identification in the management of irAEs cannot be overemphasized. Patient education is even more important than conventional chemotherapy or targeted therapy.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> In the present study, severe irAEs were often detected during an unscheduled hospital visit, triggered by reports from caregivers via phone. Most patients experienced a time lag of several days from symptom onset before reporting to the HCPs. Four of the 17 patients did not report symptoms to the HCPs and waited until scheduled visits. First, this result supports the importance of educating patients and caregivers. Caregivers play an important role in managing irAEs to detect abnormalities in patients or report them on their behalf. Second, non-specific symptoms potentially contribute to the time lag, especially pneumonitis and adrenal insufficiency, which are common in hospitalized patients. Non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue and anorexia, render it difficult for patients and caregivers to recognize irAEs, and they tend to disregard these symptoms.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Although patients need to understand the mechanisms underlying irAEs and differences in the side effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy, older patients, who commonly develop lung cancer, may find them difficult to understand. Therefore, the amount of knowledge provided and timing of education must be determined. The bottom line of patient education is that patients can consult HCPs in a timely manner and report that they have been exposed to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and their subjective symptoms. McGettigan et al highlighted that any change from baseline health, whether subtle or seemingly insignificant, may be a sign of an irAE and should thus be reported immediately to HCPs.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p><p id="p0100">Differences in irAE frequency and severity according to the mode of PD-1/PD-L1 usage are another point to be considered in patient education. In this study, patients who received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as maintenance therapy after chemoradiation were characterized by a high frequency and low severity of irAEs. Most of the patients experienced mild dermatitis or hyperthyroidism. The purpose of chemoradiation followed by PD-1/PD-L1 therapy for stage III lung cancer is to achieve a radical cure<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref>; therefore, it would be beneficial for patients to avoid treatment interruption or discontinuation by appropriately educating them.</p><p id="p0105">It is important to educate patients and caregivers that even slight changes in symptoms after initiating ICI therapy should be reported and encourage them not to hesitate to consult HCPs by phone. In addition, education and follow-up of symptoms should be provided regularly and repeatedly, even after the completion or discontinuation of ICI therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>Importance of telephone triage</title><p id="p0110">Twelve patients were found to have severe irAEs during unscheduled hospital visits, and they consulted HCPs via phone regarding their symptoms before hospital visits. The importance of telephone triage in managing the side effects of anticancer treatment is significant.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> The purpose of telephone triage is to identify patients requiring an immediate hospital visit, those requiring follow-up at shorter intervals, and those able to wait until the next scheduled visit.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Reducing unnecessary emergency room visits and medical costs is also important.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> For the management of irAEs, telephone triage is often the initial step to detecting irAEs.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> In response to telephone consultations from patients and caregivers, quick and in-depth assessments using professional irAE knowledge are required in HCPs. In addition to the triage itself, HCPs also need to inform patients and caregivers of how their symptoms can change in the future and signs of deterioration that require further contact. Thus, phone communication is an opportunity for patient education. Jamieson et al reported that patients and caregivers hesitated to consult HCPs for the following reasons: they thought that they might be very busy; past experiences of not being treated properly, such as being told to call back again during business hours; or fear of disease progression or treatment discontinuation.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> HCPs need to respond carefully to patients and caregivers through open communication and pay attention to the psychological aspects of patients and caregivers.</p><p id="p0115">In addition to education for HCPs, a systematic approach is required to improve telephone triage quality because not all HCPs specialize in irAEs. Developing evidence-based triage and care protocols based on institutional requirements is warranted.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> As Cole et al highlighted, interventions are necessary at three levels (patients, HCPs, and institutions) to improve irAE management.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> Optimizing telephone triage by both HCP education and organizational interventions is valid.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>IrAEs that frequently required hospitalization</title><p id="p0120">In this study, one in every 10 patients required irAE-related hospitalization. The most frequent complication was pneumonitis, followed by adrenal insufficiency. These results are consistent with those of the previous study focusing on irAE-related hospitalizations.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref></p><p id="p0125">Pneumonitis is an irAE with many severe cases.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In this study, ten patients (6.3% of evaluable patients) required hospitalization because of pneumonitis, a slightly higher figure than in previous reports.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> Two patients were diagnosed with severe pneumonitis at scheduled visits after more than a one-week time lag after dyspnea onset.

The self-monitoring of oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry may contribute to early detection.</p><p id="p0130">The timing of pneumonitis onset varies widely. However, severe pneumonitis is often reported to develop early during treatment.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In the present study, all but two events occurred within 90 days of PD-1/PD-L1 therapy initiation. This result demonstrates the importance of recognizing that severe pneumonitis tends to occur relatively early after initiating PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, and pneumonitis is an irAE that tends to be severe.</p><p id="p0135">The second most frequently hospitalized irAEs was adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is reportedly a relatively rare irAE. A large meta-analysis reported the incidence to be 0.7% for all grades.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Another report found 3.5%<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> of patients receiving single-use PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, similar to the population in this study. In this study, two of three patients were diagnosed at a scheduled hospital visit. However, they did not consult HCPs, regardless of their awareness of fatigue, anorexia, or nausea. Regarding adrenal insufficiency, the non-specific presentation of symptoms might have been associated with a consultation delay. Fatigue, fever, and dyspnea have been noted as risk factors for the misdiagnosis of irAEs.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Although fatigue is often observed in patients with advanced cancer,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> an irAE must be suspected when patients undergoing or past PD-1/PD-L1 therapy report new or worsening fatigue. We also need to educate patients and caregivers on the need to pay attention to fatigue after the initiation of PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, and fatigue deserves to be reported.</p><p id="p0140">The median time from the initiation of PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to the onset of adrenal insufficiency was 119.5 days. All events had onset after 90 days. A similar report from Japan revealed a median duration from the initiation to onset of 5.6 months (1.6&#x02013;12.6 months).<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Therefore, the duration from PD-1/PD-L1 therapy initiation to the onset of adrenal insufficiency tends to be longer than that of other endocrine disorders, such as hypothyroidism.</p><p id="p0145">The patient was re-hospitalized for the recurrence of adrenal insufficiency caused by discontinuation of oral steroids. Endocrine disorders include adrenal insufficiency, which often requires long-term hormone replacement therapy.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Therefore, it is important to provide patient guidance regarding steroid medication. While adrenal insufficiency potentially leads to fatal adrenal crisis, subjective symptoms such as fatigue often improve quickly with steroid administration.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> Thus, early consultation and diagnosis might have prevented hospitalization.</p><p id="p0150">In summary, pneumonitis and adrenal insufficiency can be considered irAEs that emphasize patient education during the PD-1/PD-L1 therapy for lung cancer. Pneumonitis has a high frequency and high risk of being severe, whereas adrenal insufficiency has a low frequency but a high proportion of severe events. In addition, both are characterized by non-specific symptom presentations that are difficult to recognize and diagnose.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0155">This study has certain limitations. First, this was a retrospective study with a small sample size in a single Japanese institution. Therefore, there might have been some unmeasured confounders, and it is difficult to generalize the results of this study. Second, we did not use detailed and structured information sheets to collect patients' educational needs. This is one of the major limitations of our retrospective study. Besides, a deeper qualitative analysis of the situations and experiences of patients and caregivers based on data obtained through interviews is warranted. Third, the lack of objectivity in the diagnostic criteria of &#x0201c;irAEs requiring hospitalization&#x0201d; is another limitation. Fourth, owing to the difficulty in diagnosing irAEs, not all irAEs might have been recognized as irAEs. Finally, since the observation period was brief, some irAEs were likely to develop after that time. A longer follow-up period may help clarify how long irAEs should be focused on after initiating PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.</p><p id="p0160">Recently, a nurse-led randomized controlled trial<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a patient-reported monitoring system for irAEs based on the patient-reported outcomes version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE&#x02122;).<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> However, the effect of reducing severe irAEs, which was the primary outcome, was not observed. It is necessary to accumulate data through practice and research to ensure effective patient education and timing. Moreover, as the frequency of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in lung cancer increases, severe irAEs are likely to increase, especially gastrointestinal irAEs, such as colitis.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> The single or combinatorial use of ICIs will be more prevalent in various cancers at various stages. Therefore, the management of irAEs in nursing is becoming increasingly important.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0165">For advanced lung cancer, approximately half of the patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 developed irAEs, and 11.3% required hospitalization. Over half of the hospitalizations were triggered by reports by caregivers via phone, unscheduled hospital visits led to the detection of severe irAEs, and most patients experienced several-day time lags from symptom onset before reporting to HCPs. When educating patients and caregivers, HCPs need to emphasize that even slight changes in symptoms after initiating ICI therapy should be reported and encourage them to not hesitate to consult HCPs. The minimum goal of education should be to ensure that patients or caregivers consult HCPs in a timely manner and report any exposure to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The issues to be addressed by HCPs are the establishment of a care system to manage irAEs by improving individual knowledge and HCP skills as well as developing an organizational system, such as the telephone triage protocol.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0170">Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0175">SA received a lecture fee from ONO Pharmaceutical CO.

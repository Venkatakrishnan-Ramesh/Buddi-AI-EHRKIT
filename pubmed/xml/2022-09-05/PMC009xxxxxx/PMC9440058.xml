Improving this health situation requires a better knowledge of the pathogens present in this area and of the risk factors favoring their propagation. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between the household socioeconomic status and the presence of parasites in the faeces of children between 1 and 10&#x000a0;years of age in order to determine the risk factors for intestinal parasitosis. The study included 746 children, of whom 30% were infected with parasites. <italic>Entamoeba coli</italic>, a good indicator of environmental fecal contamination, was the most prevalent parasite with an observation frequency of 16.7% followed by <italic>Giardia lamblia</italic> with a prevalence of 10%. For helminths, <italic>Trichuris</italic> and <italic>Ascaris</italic> were the most prevalent respectively 5.4% and 1.8%. A large heterogeneity in the prevalence of parasites was observed from one neighborhood to another. However, multivariate analysis showed that these differences were not related to environmental factors or household structure, but rather to the economic level of the family, the education level of the mother as well as the age of the child. For example, the prevalence of <italic>Giardia</italic> decreased from 23.5% to 8% for children of mothers with little education to those with higher education, respectively. For <italic>E. coli</italic>, the prevalence is higher among poor households and school-aged children. In the frame of IRCOD project, mothers are being sensitized to hygiene and risk factors for transmission by intestinal parasites and the present study proposes a multidimensional approach as an assessment tool.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Helminth</kwd><kwd>Madagascar</kwd><kwd>Protozoa</kwd><kwd>Suburb</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Urbanization is increasing rapidly on the African continent compared to all other regions of the world. An estimate by the United Nations predicts that 68% of the African population will be urban by 2050, which represents 2.4 billion people (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2019</xref>). This development is mainly associated with the expansion of slums and informal settlements. A rather complex system, ranging from the formation of real shantytowns made of spikes and plastic to households simply installed without an urbanization plan on the edge of the city. This causes social inequalities that will limit access to sanitation. In poor neighborhoods, the lack of environmental hygiene is one of the factors that ensure the transmission of intestinal parasites. Yet, the improvement of the standard of living significantly reduces their incidence (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Benouis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0010">Intestinal parasitosis are a public health problem, affecting &#x0003e;2 billion people worldwide. They are particularly severe in children, where they can lead to malnutrition and anemia but also reduce resistance to infection and even increased mortality (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Dianou et al., 2004</xref>). It has been estimated that over three billion people worldwide are infested with intestinal parasites (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Keiser and Utzinger, 2010</xref>). It is the second leading cause of death in Africa among children who are at greater risk because of their poorly developed immune systems and their habit of playing on soil contaminated with faeces (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Elliott and Weinstock, 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">About 24% of the world's population is infected with at least one of the following species <italic>Ascaris lumbricoides</italic>, <italic>Trichuris trichiura</italic> and <italic>Ancylostoma duodenale.</italic> They are the most common intestinal parasites.responsible of the death of approximately 135,000 persons per year (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Liese et al., 2010</xref>). A predominance of protozoa like <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Giardia</italic> in children was also reported in neighborhoods with poor sanitation (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Pires et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">Climatic conditions, poor hygiene and insufficient health education contribute to the spread of intestinal parasites (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Santiso, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Bouchaud and Aumaitre, 1999</xref>). The high proportion of parasitism is assumed to be combined with socio-economic factors and poor environmental hygiene within the region (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Dib et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, other risk factors related to the infrastructure or living conditions of the population, such as the structure of the soil, the mother's low level of school education besides the quality of drinking water, are also potential factors for parasite infection in children living in poor areas (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Habib et al., 2021</xref>). Parasite transmission also related to the number of people per household (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Berzalim, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Benouis et al., 2013</xref>), and villages located in flood-prone areas are more vulnerable (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Dianou et al., 2004</xref>). This is the case of &#x000ab; Metzinger valley &#x000bb;, a small natural valley with an almost flat topology that divides the city of Mahajanga into two parts.</p><p id="p0025">Regarding epidemics, the informal suburbs of the Mahajanga city have been hit by such diseases, including plague and cholera, which are linked to sanitation problems, precariousness and poverty (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Migliani et al., 2000</xref>). This is the case of the Metzinger valley, established at the beginning of the previous century and constantly subject to tides and more or less significant flooding episodes during each rainy season. The water level can then rise sharply, transforming the area into a lake. The urban area has undergone intense urbanization in the past decades, due to the demographic pressure, the proximity to the city center and low land costs. Becoming rapidly overcrowded, the insalubrity of these neighborhoods has been highlighted by epidemic events and has interest many public health actors. Yet, the political instability of Madagascar is challenging as the municipalities depend mainly on overseas partners for any development project. Indeed, with the financial support of the European Union, the Regional Institute for Cooperation and Development (IRCOD) is launching the so-called project ASSMA - IRCOD that aims to structure the sanitary services in the city. This framework is scheduled for a period of four years and aims to improve access to sanitation for the inhabitants of the poor and vulnerable neighborhoods of Valley Metzinger and its surroundings. It includes the installation of latrines, the cleaning of canals and the organization of a waste collection service.</p><p id="p0030">The objective of this study was to do a pre-intervention baseline evaluation of parasites contamination of the population. It will serve as a reference for fecal peril contamination of the environment. The second objective was to analyze the relationship between the socioeconomic situation of households and the presence of parasites in the fecal samples from children aged between 1 and 10&#x000a0;years. Others variables related to the house, the lifestyle and the household income have also been included for more comprehensive information.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Patients, materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study site</title><p id="p0035">The study was conducted in Mahajanga the main town of the north-western province of Madagascar. The city is divided in two parts by a small valley named &#x0201c;Metzinger valley&#x0201d;. During the colonial period, a large canal was built by Metzinger to collect surface water. Afterwards, this area was invaded by informal housing which disrupted drainage, resulting in frequent flooding in the area during rainy season, creating an unhealthy lake that persists for weeks (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The town of Mahajanga is divided into 26 neighborhoods out of which ten are located in the Metzinger valley (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).

Despite the low level of organization inthe area, each household was registered with a number on the administrative list. This number was also written on the door of eachhouse, thus allowing its localization in the quarter. The number of people per family was also registered on the same list. The objective was to randomly sample at least 50 children in each neighborhood. For each quarter, thirty families were randomly drawn from the list using the cumulative total household population to take family size into account. The enrolment of each family was preceded by the writing of an informed consent of the parents or tutors of the children. In each household, a questionnaire was submitted to the head of the household during a 30-min interview. Variables documented are listed in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

The aim of this study was firstly to identify the intestinal parasites present in the faeces of children aged between 1 and 10&#x000a0;years, then to analyze the relationship between the presence of the parasites and the socioeconomic status of the households in order to determine the risk factors for intestinal parasitosis In nine quarters, &#x0003e;30% of the children were parasitized. Therefore, this study was important to identifying high-risk fokontany that should be the target some additional priority interventions.</p><p id="p0130">Microscopic examination identified highly predominant species of intestinal parasites like <italic>Giardia</italic>, <italic>Trichoc&#x000e9;phale</italic>, <italic>Ascaris</italic>, <italic>H. nana</italic>, <italic>S. mansoni</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>E. hartmani</italic>, and <italic>Anguillule</italic>. These intestinal infections were widespread over the 14 fokontany by the valley. Tsararano ambany and Tsararano ambony were the most affected by parasites such as <italic>Giardia</italic>, <italic>Ascaris</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> with an overall frequency of 35%. This prevalence is common in intertropical towns like in the city of Itabuna, Bahia (31.2%), in Ivory Coast (55.2%) (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Mariano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Adoubryn et al., 2012</xref>) or even in the Sahelian region like in Niamey in Niger (33%) (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Soumana et al., 2016</xref>). This high prevalence of intestinal parasitosis is similar to those observed in villages in Burkina Faso located near the rivers and in flood zones (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Dianou et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p id="p0135"><italic>Giardia intestinalis</italic> was the most frequently encountered parasite with a prevalence of 19.2%.

The highest prevalence of <italic>Giardia</italic> was found in the Fokontany &#x0201c;Tsararano Ambany&#x0201d;, a frequently flooded area near the canal with a rate of 19.2%. This prevalence of <italic>Giardia</italic> decreased when the mother's level of education was high.

The establishment of a sanitation chain, the use of latrines and the application of hygiene measures were thus essential The living space (and thus the Metzinger valley) was not a predominant risk factor. Mass de-worming programs, sanitation improvement and monitoring of latrines must be urgently implemented, with the target being the most infected children i.e., those at school age. Awareness-raising activitiestargeting the parents is needed, including awareness on fecal hygiene, proper maintenance of toilets and appropriate treatment of water (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Halliday et al., 2019</xref>). It would be important to share these data with public health officers to develop educational programs to reduce the incidence of infections and illness in children living in this endemic area (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2006</xref>). Moreover, few studies have been done on the epidemiological profile of intestinal parasitosis in Mahajanga including the Metzinger valley, thus, this study provides a database for surveillance and prevention of fecal-related infectious diseases and for future sanitation projects.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0155">This study was supported by the <funding-source id="gts0005"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source>, part of the <funding-source id="gts0010">IRCOD project</funding-source>.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="p0160">This project was approved by the National Ethic Committee of Madagascar.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0170">No conflict of interest was declared.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adoubryn</surname><given-names>K.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kouadio-Yapo</surname><given-names>C.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ouhon</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Aka</surname><given-names>N.A.D.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Intestinal parasites in children in Biankouma, Ivory Coast (mountaineous western region): efficacy and safety of praziquantel and albendazole</article-title><source>M&#x000e9;d.

vascular endothelial growth factor and human umbilical vein endothelial cells on adipose-derived stem cells to achieve
a 3-dimensional engineered vascular-muscle structure.
</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The present experimental research was designed based on two main groups, i.e. monoculture
of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and co-culture of ADSCs and human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) in a ratio of 1:1. Skeletal muscle tissue was isolated, decellularized and its surface was electrospun using
polycaprolactone/gelatin parallel nanofibers and then matrix topography was evaluated through H&#x00026;E, trichrome
staining and SEM. The expression of <italic>MyHC2</italic> gene and tropomyosin protein were examined through real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescence, respectively. Finally, the morphology
of mesenchymal and endothelial cells and their relationship with each other and with the engineered scaffold were
examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> According to H&#x00026;E and Masson&#x02019;s Trichrome staining, muscle tissue was completely decellularized.
SEM showed parallel Polycaprolactone (PCL)/gelatin nanofibers with an average diameter of about 300 nm. The
immunofluorescence proved that tropomyosin was positive in the ADSCs monoculture and the ADSCs/HUVECs co-
culture in horse serum (HS) and HS/VEGF groups. There was a significant difference in the expression of the <italic>MyHC2</italic>
gene between the ADSCs and ADSCs/HUVECs culture groups (P&#x0003c;0.05) and between the 2D and 3D models in HS/
VEGF differentiation groups (P&#x0003c;001). Moreover, a significant increase existed between the HS/VEGF group and other
groups in terms of endothelial cells growth and proliferation as well as their relationship with differentiated myoblasts
(P&#x0003c;0.05).
</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Co-culture of ADSCs/HUVECs on the engineered cell-free muscle scaffold and the dual effects of VEGF
can lead to formation of a favorable engineered vascular-muscular tissue. These engineered structures can be used as

which investigated 2D co-culture in muscle tissue
challenges such as volumetric muscle loss (VML) (1).
VML refers to the special volumetric, contractive, and nonreturnable injury of the muscle tissue that can arise due
to various causes such as severe trauma, cancer, surgery,
and accident (2). Skeletal muscle, like other tissues, has a
significant regenerative ability following injury; a process
in which a part of the muscle can grow and develop (3).
However, this regenerative response is ineffective when
a large volume of the muscle is lost. According to recent
studies, there is a limited treatment options for VML and
no favorable, effective, and definitive treatment is found for
this challenge so far (4). New methods, such as regenerative
medicine with its high potential for regeneration and
substitution of damaged tissues and organs, have attracted
the attention of researchers in recent years (5).</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> designing of favorable tissue models for use in tissue
engineering is considered an acceptable therapeutic option for important challenges such as
VML (6). The use of stem cells in research has received attention in the last two decades.
Adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are one of the special stem cells that have
gradually found their place in these studies. They are ideal options in regenerative
medicine as their favorable features such as easy isolation and culture and their control,
high growth and differentiation potential, non-invasiveness, and lack of ethical
consideration have attracted the attention of most researchers (7). It has been founded that
decellularization is as an effective strategy in tissue engineering, and decellularized
tissues have been used in recent years in biomedical applications such as research on
physicochemical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and providing a special tissue
scaffold with native mixture, consisting of tissue-specific macromolecules within a 3D
structure, for redesigning the functional tissues of the body (8). ECM is a complex of
proteins and polysaccharides as well as a combination of tissueor organ-specific scaffold
basic components. In the skeletal muscle tissue, the large part of the ECM consists of
collagen fibers, different types of ECM components such as laminin, elastin, and
glycosaminoglycans, growth factors, and a high number of proteoglycans and glycoproteins
that are necessary for cell adhesion, permeability, migration, and differentiation (9).</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that in muscular tissue
engineering, homologue tissues play a key role in the
growth, differentiation, and regeneration processes of
damaged tissues (10).</p><p>On the other hand, various studies have reported that
differentiation of stem cells to myoblasts and formation
of muscle fibers requires scaffolds with parallel and
unidirectional fibers. Due to lack of certain superficial
direction in biological scaffolds such as muscle ECM,
the use of parallel electrospun nanofibers has gained
a particular importance as an acceptable strategy for
induction and improvement of myogenesis.
</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that the combination of
the synthetic and natural polymers of Polycaprolactone
(PCL) and gelatin has a crucial role in adhesion, growth,
and organization of ADSCs (11), tendon engineering
advancement (12), regeneration of cardiac muscle tissue,
and proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts to
skeletal muscle myotubes (13).</p><p>Despite all mentioned issues, creation of an ideal engineered structure for differentiation
and formation of parallel muscular myofibrils has been always associated with development of
neurovascular structures as an inseparable part of normal tissues and a challenge against
muscular tissue engineering. Co-culture of endothelial cells with other cell types has been
used in recent years for formation of vascular structures in engineered structures as a
novel method and trustable strategy to solve this challenge. For instance, it was shown that
co-culture of endothelial cells with primary osteoblasts, fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells
can significantly improve vascular bifurcations and buds <italic>in vitro</italic> (14). In
addition, as the third factor in muscle tissue engineering, it seems necessary to use
factors which, besides formation of vascular structures, can affect the differentiation of
myoblasts. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key angiogenesis regulating factor
during embryogenesis that can also affect many adult cells. Studies have shown that this
factor has inductive roles in endothelial cells, myoblasts, hepatocytes, and neurons in
cellular migration, cellular protection against apoptosis, and induction of myoblasts for
formation of myofibrils (15).</p><p>Given the existing challenge, the main objective of this
experimental study is to evaluate the myogenic effects of
skeletal muscle ECM, VEGF and human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) on adipose-derived stem
cells (ADSCs) to achieve a 3-dimensional engineered
vascular-muscle structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>ADSCs isolation and culture</title><p>In this experimental research, ADSCs were isolated according to a previous study (1).
Briefly, the adipose tissue was removed from the gonadal region of Wistar rats, washed
with PBS containing 1% penicillin/ streptomycin, and fragmented to facilitate the
enzymatic digestion. The specimens were incubated with collagenase type I at 37&#x000b0;C for
30-40 minutes and then the enzyme effect was neutralized using the culture medium
[Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)]. (DMEM, 10% FBS).
To separate adipocytes from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), the cell suspension was
centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was then discarded and the cellular
palate was immersed in a culture medium containing DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were plated at 2.5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>
per 25 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks and incubated at 37&#x002da;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
After 2 days, the non-adherent cells were discarded, and the cellular passage stages were
performed 4 times on adheerent cells. After 4 passages, for ADSCs characterization, the
surface antigens of ADSCs including CD73, CD44, and CD90 as positive markers and CD45 as
the negative marker were evaluated through flow cytometry assay. To induce myogenesis of
the mesenchymal cells, ADSCs were cultured in the DMEM culture medium containing 10% FBS
and 3 M 5-Azacytidine (Sigma, NY, USA) for 24 hours and then in the DMEM supplemented with
5% horse serum (HS, Gibco, NY, USA) for 7 days. Supplemented media was replaced every 48
hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Decellularization of skeletal muscle</title><p>Muscle tissue decellularization was performed
according to previous protocols, as shown in
Figure 1. After euthanization of Wistar rats, the
anterior abdominal muscles (external and internal
oblique) were removed. To further improve the quality
of the decellularization process, the muscle layers
were separated. Samples were washed in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) with 1% antifungal and antibiotic
solution, and then the muscle tissue was purified from
all vascular, fat and connective tissue and washed out
for 1 hour in deionised water. These samples were then
treated with 0.5 M NaCl for 4 hours, followed by 1
M NaCl for 4 hours, and washed in ultra-pure water
for 48 hours. After being treated with 0.25% trypsin/
EDTA at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 hours, the samples were washed
in dhen samples were processed with DNAase at 37&#x000b0;C
for 3 hours, washed in ultra-pure water for 2 days, rinsed in PBS for 24 hours and finally kept at 4&#x000b0;C till
use (Fig.2A).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram representing the different steps of this study.

accuracy of decellularized muscles were determined by
visual examination, tissue staining and also by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig.2B). For tissue staining,
a part of the prepared tissue was fixed in 10% formalin.
Samples were then embedded in paraffin to provide
microscopic sections and then stained with H&#x00026;E and
Masson&#x02019;s Trichrome at different magnifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>SEM evaluation was done based on previous protocols
(19). First the scaffolds were washed three times with PBS
and then fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution (Sigma,
USA) for 30 minutes. The samples were dehydrated in
different percentages of ethanol aqueous solutions from
30% to 100% successively for 10 minutes each and dried
at room temperature under sterile conditions under the
hood. After preparing the samples, SEM (SEM, Zeiss
Evo 50, Germany) examination was used to determine
the surface topography (with and without PCL/Gelatin
nanofibers), arrangement of ECM fibers and structure and
porosity of decellularized muscle tissue.</p><p>In addition, after fabrication of parallel PCL/Gelatin
nanofibers on the ECM surface and cell culture, the
samples were prepared in the same way in order to
visualize the orientation and diameter of the nanofibers,
surface topography of the electrospun nanofibers, cell
morphology, attachment and interaction with other cells
by SEM. Fiber diameters and size distribution were
measured from the SEM images using Image J software
version 1.46 (NIH, MD).</p></sec><sec><title>Fabrication of of polycaprolactone/gelatin nanofibers</title><p>PCL (Sigma-Aldrich, USA, Mw: 80000 g/mol) and
gelatin type A (from porcine skin in powder form,
Sigma-Aldrich, USA) scaffold were prepared by the
electrospinning method as described previously (16).
Briefly, to prepare a 10% (w/v) concentration solution,
PCL, and gelatin in a 50/50 (w/w) ratio was dissolved
separately in 2, 2, 2-trifluoroethanol (TFE, SigmaAldrich, USA) and stirred overnight until the mixture
was dissolved completely at room temperature. Before
stirring, 1% acetic acid (Fisher Scientific, USA) was
added to the final solution to improve miscibility.</p><p>For the electrospinning process, PCL/gelatin solution
was loaded into a 10-mL syringe with a 21-Gauge
needle that was located at a distance of 130 mm from the
collector. The solution flow rate, applied voltage, collector
rotation speed and duration were set to 1 mL/hour, 22 kV,
2,500 rmp and 4 minutes, respectively. Moreover, before
the electrospinning process, decellularized muscle ECM
was placed on the collector (Fig.1). The process was
carried out at room temperature within a range of relative
humidity (45-50%). The PCL/Gelatin solvent turned to
nanofibers and was collected in parallel orientation on
decellularized muscle ECM on the collector. Before using
the engineered scaffolds, in order to dry and stabilize the
nanofibers, they were kept in a sterile environment at
room temperature overnight.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanical tensile test </title><p>The tensile strength of the decellularized muscle
scaffolds, with or without parallel PCL/gelatin electrospun
nanofibers, was evaluated in dry and wet conditions
(Cultivated for 10 days in DMEM culture medium) by the
material test device (Wance, China) equipped with a 5 kN
load cell. Initially, strip-shaped pieces were prepared at a
12 mm width&#x000d7;30 mm length from both types of scaffolds.
Tensile tests and their analysis were performed after
setting the crosshead speed at 10 mm/minutes. At least
three samples were investigated. Finally, using the tensile
stress curve obtained from the test device, we examined
the tensile strength and scaffold elastic modulus (17).</p></sec><sec><title>MTT assay</title><p>MTT (3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide) assays were used to
evaluate the effects of engineered muscle scaffold on ADSCs/HUVECs co-culture viability
and proliferation. Briefly, ADSC and HUVEC cells were seeded in 96-well plates
(1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/ well) and were then maintained with culture media for 48 h.
Then the cells were further incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/mL) for 4 hours at 37&#x000b0;C. After
removal of the super-natants, 700 &#x003bc;L of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well
to dissolve the formazan product. Then using a microplate reader (BioRad, Hercules, CA)
absorbance was measured at 540 nm. Optical density values of the control cells were
calculated as 100% viability. Because absorbance is in proportion to the number of living
cells in a sample, the MTT assay reflects the extent of cell proliferation (17).</p></sec><sec><title>Co-culture models</title><p>The HUVECs were obtained from the Iranian Biological Resource Center and cultured in
their special culture medium (1). To track HUVECs in co-culture with ADSCs, they were
labeled with C7000 according to the cell tracking guideline CellTrackerTM CM-DiI (C7000)
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Briefly, HUVEC cells were plated at 2.5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup>
cells/cm<sup>2</sup> per 25 cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks. Then 15 &#x000b5;l of CM-DiI
(C7000) was added for every 4 ml of culture medium and incubated at 37&#x002da;C in 5%
CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 to 48 hours. After removal the supernatants, the attached cells
could be seen in red light using fluorescence microscopy. The cell tracker was still
detectable up to 2 passages.</p><p>Similar to our previous study, 2 experimental
groups were designed in this research, so that each
group was evaluated in 3 different culture media
including the control group, the horse serum (HS)
differentiation culture medium group, and the HS/
VEGF differentiation culture medium group. <xref rid="s1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table
S1</xref> represents a brief description of the experimental

performed at a ratio of 1:1. The dose of VEGF used in the
experimental groups was 50 ng/&#x000b5;L. The main points of
this study are shown in Figure 1.
</p></sec><sec><title>Cell labeling</title><p>HUVECs were marked with CM-DiI (Invitrogen,
USA) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and then
confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after 1 day.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain

polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to confirm the expression of

extraction, cultured cells were lysed using the RNeasy plus Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Then, by using a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific, USA) the cells were quantified. cDNA synthesis using a QuantiTect Reverse

7, the scaffolds were washed three times with PBS and
then fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% for 20 minutes.
Then, the scaffolds with their surface cells became
permeable using Triton X-100 for 10 minutes and were
rinsed again with PBS. To prevent any non-specific
adherence, they were impregnated in BSA 3% for 2 hours.
Experimental groups were stained with primary antibody
against anti-tropomyosin antibody (1:100, Sigma, USA)
overnight at 4&#x002da;C. Then, the cultured cells on muscle
scaffold were rinsed with PBS and incubated with goat
anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:150, Sigma, USA) for 1 hour.
Using 4&#x000b4;, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:400,
Sigma, USA), nuclear staining was done for 15 minutes at
room temperature. Ultimately, the scaffolds were washed
three times with PBS and then examined by an invert
fluorescent microscope (IX 71, Olympus, Japan). </p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This research was approved by the Ethics Committee of

results of which showed that CD44, CD73, and CD90
were expressed on the surface of these cells and almost
a negligible number of the cells were positive for the
hematopoietic cell marker CD45. All these results indicate
the high purity of the isolated mesenchymal stem cells. </p></sec><sec><title>Co-culture and differentiation of ADSCs/HUVECs in
3D culture</title><p>In the 3D culture, ADSCs/HUVECs were cultured on the
muscle ECM engineered with PCL/gelatin nanofibers in
different culture media (proliferation or differentiation) for
1 week according to the experimental groups. Each group
of endothelial cells (stained with C7000 cell marker) and
mesenchymal cells (stained with tropomyosin antibody)
in monoculture and co-culture states were evaluated.
As shown in Figure 4, the growth and cell proliferation
of HUVECs in the HS group was much lower than the
VEGF group. The results from ADSCs groups indicated
myogenic differentiation of ADSCs to myoblast-like cells
and the expression of tropomyosin on the engineered
scaffold in the monoculture and co-culture. In addition, it
was shown that the differentiated cells in the Co-culture/
HS/VEGF group were arranged close to the HUVECs
on the engineered structure. Although no geometrical
vascular structure was observed, their proliferation and
distribution in the VEGF-differentiated group was well
observable. VEGF in the Co-culture groups also increased
the myogenic induction and hence lead endothelial cells
to be in close proximity with differentiated myoblast-like
cells (Fig.4).</p></sec><sec><title>Scanning electron microscopy</title><p>Seven days after differentiation, the position
and arrangement of the ADSCs and HUVECs on
the engineered scaffold with PCL/gelatin parallel
nanofibers were examined through SEM. The results
revealed that the ADSCs/HUVECs co-culture had a
higher growth and proliferation in the VEGF-treated
group. Based on the cells&#x02019; dimensions, it can be
concluded that the higher number of endothelial cells
(signified with *) was the reason for the higher density
in the VEGF group, which indicates the capacity of
this cell model for providing the angiogenesis process
in the engineered scaffold. These cells were located
on the PCL/gelatin parallel nanofibers and attached
to each other and to the scaffold underneath. In the
absence of VEGF, proliferation of the cells was low
which was consistent with the findings obtained from
immunofluorescence technique (Fig.5).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Fig 4</label><caption><p>Immunofluorescence and Morphological characterization of ADSCs,
HUVECs and HUVECs and ADSCs co-culture in experimental groups (HS

increased in HS/VEGF group and were arranged in proximity to parallel
nanofibers. As shown in figures, the proliferation and distribution of
HUVECs in the HS/VEGF group was increased in comparison to the HS
group which indicates the predictable effect of VEGF on HUVECs. Also
the orientation of the PCL/Gelatin nanofibers can be detected. In HUVECs
and ADSCs co-culture, Tropomyosin-specific fluorescent staining for
differentiated mesenchymal cells and endothelial cells-specific C7000

in particular endothelial cells, was higher in the VEGF-differentiated

proved that the expression of <italic>MyHC2</italic> was significantly higher in the VEGF
and HS groups as compared with the control group (P&#x0003c;0.001). In addition, there was
a significant difference between the VEGF and HS groups in terms of expression of this
gene (P&#x0003c;0.05). As an important point of these findings, expression of
<italic>MyHC2</italic> in the presence of VEGF was increased in the ADSCs/ HUVECs
co-culture in comparison with the ADSCs monoculture (P&#x0003c;0.05). However, there was no
significant difference between the HS-treated group in co-culture and ADSCs monoculture
groups in <italic>MyHC2</italic> expression. These results indicated that VEGF along with
HUVECs can increase the expression of <italic>MyHC2</italic> in the mesenchymal
differentiated group as compared with the other groups (Fig.6). It should be mentioned
that although HUVECs monoculture (without VEGF) were unable to significantly improve
<italic>MyHC2</italic> gene expression, the co-culture along with VEGF resulted in a
significant difference in comparison with ADSCs monoculture (P&#x0003c;0.05). This finding
indicates the effective role of ADSCs/HUVECs co-culture along with the use of VEGF in
increased expression of the myogenic differentiation genes. The results of comparison
between 2D and 3D cultures in different groups showed that the <italic>MyHC2</italic> gene
had a significantly higher expression in the 3D culture in comparison with the 2D culture,
so that its expression was significantly increased in the HS/3D group compared to the

process and achievement of a favorable and contractive
tissue requires some prerequisites such as formation
of myofibrils, development of vascular structures,
innervation, and improvement and organization of the
ECM (18).</p><p>In this study, the effects of endothelial cells (HUVECs), VEGF, and engineered muscle ECM
with PCL/gelatin nanofibers was investigated on myogenic differentiation of the ADSCs. The
use of such a scaffold along with ADSCs/HUVEC co-culture in evaluation of myogenic
differentiation and their mutual roles to improve angiogenesis have not been investigated so
far. The muscle scaffold or ECM was used given numerous studies performed in this regard.
ECM is usually obtained through decellularization of the tissues and organs of mammals. For
example, ECM of intestine, dermis, bladder, pericardium, heart valves, amniotic membrane,
muscle, and fascia are approved by FDA to be used for soft tissue regeneration (19). Li et
al. (20) reported that the use of dehydrated amniotic membrane in damaged biceps femoris of
rats caused migration of a higher number of myoblasts to the affected area. In another
study, Merritt et al. (21) evaluated the role of muscle-derived ECM in the improvement of
the gastrocnemius muscle function in Lewis mice and showed a function improvement rate of
85% after a period of 42 days, indicating the effective therapeutic role of the ECM and
BMSCs combination in regeneration of skeletal muscle. In this regard, Badylak et al. (22)
used a medical regeneration approach on 13 patients with muscle defects and showed that the
contractive force increased by 37.3% and muscle motility improved by 27.1% after using
muscle ECM in the damaged area and physiotherapy exercises. According to previous studies
and the confirmed effective role of decellularized scaffold, abdominal muscle tissue ECM was
used in this study, so that after decellularization of the tissue, a clear cell-free
structure was obtained and used for <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. In this study, a
transparent muscle scaffold was obtained that had a significant role in myogenic
differentiation (as increased expression of the <italic>MyHC2</italic> gene) in ADSCs
compared with 2D culture. The muscle ECM is an ideal option in muscle tissue engineering due
to its specific properties. </p><p>Wang et al. (17) compared the decellularized muscle
and fascia tissues in their study and showed that both
tissues not only maintained their 3D optimal structure,
mechanical properties, and biologic compounds, but also
were non-toxic and well retained their ability to induce
the integrity of human adipose stem cells (hASCs). In
addition, they reported that the muscle scaffold has a
significant role in induction of angiogenesis and the
pro-myogenic properties in comparison with the fascia
scaffold, which can be considered as a favorable scaffold
for engineering muscle and fascia tissues.</p><p>It should be noted that in addition to the scaffold material and ECM properties, the
surface topography is an important parameter for muscle tissue engineering. Regular and
unidirectional scaffolds are more potent to form myotubes and regular arrangement of
myofibers than scaffolds with multidirectional fibers on their surface. Chen et al. (23)
used a new type of 3D porous collagen scaffold with special microgrooves in their research,
which formed a structure similar to the muscle basement membrane for skeletal muscle tissue
engineering. In our study, the topography of the muscle scaffold due to lack of no specific
direction was engineered to create a favorable and parallel shape for myogenic
differentiation using PCL/gelatin parallel nanofibers electrospinning. PCL/gelatin is an
ideal compound for tissue engineered, because PCL increases the structural strength and
gelatin can improve cell attachment. Kim et al. (13) showed that the expression rate of
myosin heavy chain and troponin T in C2C12 cells and their proliferation rate increased
significantly when the PCL/gelatin scaffold was used as compared with the PCL scaffold.
Likewise, Yang et al. (12) showed that human ADSCs were arranged longitudinally in parallel
with the electrospun PCL/gelatin nanofibers and were able to acquire tendon cell phenotypes
under the influence of TGF-&#x003b2;3. Our research indicated a better arrangement of ADSCs
unidirectional with the parallel nanofibers and expression of differentiation factors, in
particular the expression of <italic>MyHC2</italic> gene in the HS and HS/VEGF
differentiation groups both in the monoculture and co-culture as compared with the 2D
culture (lacking the parallel nanofibers). It seems that using VEGF could be helpful in the
muscular-vascular differentiation process. VEGF is a key regulator of angiogenesis, but its
effect on restoration of muscular force and musculoskeletal damages regeneration has not yet
been properly identified. Recent studies have shown that VEGF may affect a lot of different
cells including neurons, hepatocytes, osteoblasts, hematocytes, and myoblasts (24). In
addition, it was proven that in vitro administration of VEGF can stimulate migration of
myoblasts, improvement of cell life critical conditions, protection of myogenic cells
against apoptosis, and progression of myoblast growth (15). Chen et al. (25) and Song et al.
(26) reported in two independent studies that VEGF is the main factor in differentiation of
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and ADSCS to cardiomyocyte, respectively. </p><p>The results of this study showed that VEGF significantly
increased the myogenic differentiation of ADSCs in
monoculture or co-culture as compared with other
differentiation or control groups.</p><p>Shvartsman et al. (27) implanted VEGF- and IGF1-
including alginate gels to the skeletal muscle ischemic
damage area and showed that they were able to increase
the regeneration speed and progression of angiogenesis
process and helped viability of myoblasts. Kim et al. (28)
showed that VEGF associated with ADSCs can be used
as an angiogenesis strategy in tissue engineering specially
the complex muscle tissue.</p><p>The results of this study are consistent with those of
other studies in this field, so that based on our study,
VEGF induced myogenic differentiation in ADSCs
and endothelial tube formation in the co-culture groups
under the influence of HS/VEGF. The endothelial tube
was observed as a regular pentagon shape initiating the
angiogenesis process in the co-culture groups in the 2D
culture. This information followed a scientific fact, that
angiogenesis is the prerequisite of favorable myogenesis
so that myogenesis seems to be increased in groups where
VEGF was used due to improved vascular structure
(although primitive). As an important point, angiogenesis
and myogenesis were induced by VEGF. This was
also mentioned in previous studies, so that increased
angiogenesis by VEGF improves the muscle function
in ischemic tissues (37). The findings of this study are
similar with previous studies regarding the relationship
between angiogenesis and more effective regeneration of
muscle tissue (29).</p><p>In this study, endothelial cells were co-cultured with
ADSCs with two objectives: first, to evaluate their roles in myogenesis differentiation of ADSCs and second,
to provide conditions for angiogenesis and vascular
organizations by HUVECs using VEGF (or paracrine
effects of ADSCs) in the engineered structure. Co-culture
of ADSCs and HUVECs was performed at a ratio of
1:1. This ratio was chosen according to previous studies
on mesenchymal cells and HUVECs (30) as well as
myoblasts and HUVECs (31). Accordingly, the cell-to-cell
interaction and the paracrine effect of endothelial cells on
differentiation, morphology, and direction of ADSCs and
vice versa was investigated. This subject was raised based
on the idea that cell-to-cell interactions between ADSCs
and HUVECs may improve myogenesis differentiation.
In this regard, Lin and Lilly (32) reported that co-culture
of endothelial cells and bone marrow-derived stem cells
(BMSCs) can guide BMSCs toward smooth muscle cells
due to their role in advancement of contractive phenotype,
decrease in proliferation, and increase in synthesis and
release of collagen fibers. Accordingly, Gholobova et
al. (33) indicated that co-culture of endothelial cells and
skeletal muscle precursor cells on engineered ECM can
improve the parallel and dense arrangement of muscle
fibers which led to expansion of the endothelial vascular
network (in particular in a high cell density).</p><p>Similarly, Chen et al. (31) reported that myoblasts and
HUVECs co-culture could cause a significant increase
in the myosin heavy chain expression rate and parallel
formation of myoblasts along with regular arrangement of
vascular endothelial tubular cells in the porous scaffold.</p><p>Koffler et al. (34) used a triple culture system consisting of myoblasts, HUVECs, and
fibroblasts and observed the formation of muscle tissue and vascular network, organization,
and integrity of the host tissue 3 weeks after implantation. Other studies have shown that
co-culture of myoblasts with endothelial cells in a sandwich-like structure improved the
formation of vascular structures (35). Criswell et al. (18) investigated the co-culture of
HUVECs and precursors of 10T1/2 myoblasts on an acellular bladder scaffold <italic>in
vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and showed that the rate of angiogenesis,
innervations, and myogenesis significantly increased in comparison with scaffolds cultured
with only myoblasts.</p><p>The present study proved that although VEGF-free HUVECs were not able to significantly
improve the expression of <italic>MyHC2</italic> gene, their simultaneous co-culture with
the use of VEGF led to significant difference in comparison with the ADSCs monoculture. This
finding indicates the effective role of ADSCs and HUVECs co-culture on the expression of
differentiation genes especially when VEGF was used. It should be noted that there are
scarce information about co-culture of ADSCs/ HUVECs in the myogenic differentiation
process, and most studies focused on the muscle precursor cells. As another important point,
this study investigated the role of HUVECs on myogenic differentiation and ADSCs direction
as well as the mutual connection of these cells aiming to develop an engineered
vascular-muscle cellular model, a process that has not been studied yet. This study intended
to design a favorable cell model using a cellfree muscle scaffold aiming to develop a
vascular-muscle structure and take a step toward solving the extensive challenges of muscle
tissue.</p><p>Angiogenesis and formation of vascular network in engineered tissues has been always an
important challenge in recent years. Therefore, this study evaluated the formation of
vascular structures of endothelial tube formation in 2D Co-culture. We assumed that the
interaction between ADSCs and HUVECs may result in proliferation and improvement of cell
arrangement as well as angiogenesis by the endothelial cells, and all these processes may
improve myogenic differentiation. It is believed that endothelial cells are induced to
initiate the angiogenesis process, as endothelial tube formation, during regeneration of
vascular structures <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Recent studied have reported that the co-culture of
ADSCs/ECs can induce the formation of vascular sprouts
and significantly increase the number of connections and
vascular tubules. According to studies, induction of these
vascular structures may arise from factors produced by
ADSCs and released in the culture medium. Using ELISA
technique, Holnthoner et al. (36) showed that an increased
number of ADSCs in the co-culture results in an increase
in the VEGF concentration in the culture medium. It has
been proven that ADSCs release a large amount of VEGF
into their culture medium (25). Numerous studies have
reported that simultaneous induction of muscle precursor
cells and formation of vascular tubules can be stimulated
due to the paracrine effects of VEGF as well as IGF-1,
HGF, bFGF, and PDGF-BB (37). Contrary to our findings,
Kook et al. (38) did not observe any capillary network
after Co-culture of ADSCs/HUVECs in cell plates. They
reported a slight increase in proliferation, expression
of adhesion proteins, and vascular branches originating
from HUVECs in the VEGF-treated co-culture group.
In contrast to the results of Kook et al. (38) our findings
confirmed that ADSCs can induce the formation of
endothelial tube formation in the VEGF-treated coculture group (in 2D culture) significantly more than other
groups (lacking VEGF). This finding was similar to that
of Park and Gerecht (39), probably due to direct cellular
interaction and more importantly due to the effects of
ADSCs paracrine secretions such as VEGF, angiopoietin
1 and 2, and interleukin 6 which result in cell proliferation
and endothelial tube formation in HUVECs. Finally, after
accurately reviewing all aspects in this study, it can be
concluded that this research confirms other studies in this
regard: on the one hand, its provides a favorable cellular
model in the framework of an engineered ECM muscle
scaffold and on the other hand, it was able to take a step
towards designing an effective engineered vascularmuscle structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It can be generally concluded that muscle ECM
engineered scaffolds can be used as a desirable strategy
in muscle tissue engineering. Also, ADSCs / HUVECs cell interaction and dual effects of VEGF can result in the
myogenic differentiation of ADSCs in close proximity
to endothelial cells and vascular network. Co-culture of
ADSCs/HUVECs can be an ideal option for achieving
a favorable cellular model for use in the engineered
vascular-muscular tissues. Redesigning such engineered
structures can be used in challenging muscle injuries
such as VML, where muscle and vascular structures
regeneration are required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary PDF</title><supplementary-material id="s1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="Cell-J-24-380-s01.pdf" id="d64e395" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This manuscript is second part of a Ph.D. thesis,

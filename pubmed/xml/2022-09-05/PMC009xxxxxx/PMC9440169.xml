Due to the high loads experienced, the meniscus is commonly damaged; in fact, the most common intra-articular knee injury is a meniscal tear, which often occurs due to trauma caused by twisting or hyperflexion of the knee. Traumatic meniscal tears are common in young, active sportspeople following a compression and rotation injury, but meniscal tears can occur at any age, resulting from low-velocity injury, particularly in a middle-aged patient, with activities such as squatting or twisting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A meniscal tear has a number of associated signs and symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A popping sound around the knee joint is the most common early symptom of a tear. Subsequently, common symptoms include effusion, pain, difficulty in straightening the knee or locking, and a feeling of instability or giving way when placed under pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Similarly, patients learn avoidance behaviour to protect their damaged meniscus. Meniscal tears have a mean annual incidence of between 60 and 70 people per 100,000 and occur more frequently in males than in females (male-to-female ratio ranging from 2.5:1 to 4:1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is likely due to the increased participation of males in activities that are associated risk factors for this type of injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In England and Wales, meniscal tears are responsible for an estimated 25,000 hospital admissions per year and are associated with a high annual cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">A torn meniscus is typically identified through history and physical examination, with a magnetic resonance imaging study being the best method of detecting and characterizing a tear due to its ability to produce detailed images of both hard and soft tissue within the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A meniscal tear can either be treated surgically or non-surgically, with patient management often guided by individual patient characteristics such as age, expectations, activity level, lifestyle, health status, and factors related to the injury itself, such as location, type, and tissue quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The purpose of both surgical and non-surgical management is to reduce pain, increase function, improve stability, and prevent future damage of the knee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Conservative management will typically involve recommendations to rest the injury, apply ice, compression (with a knee brace, or splint if necessary), and/or exercise and physical therapy to strengthen the affected leg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Lifestyle modification is also often advised with weight reduction and avoidance of aggravating factors. Patients may also be advised to take analgesics, anti-inflammatory medication and/or intra-articular injections, e.g., corticosteroid to manage the associated pain, if required. However, the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for pain management has come under scrutiny of late [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], with recent studies indicating that such treatments may not provide long-term pain relief and may have an adverse effect on the cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Where surgical intervention for meniscus dysfunction or injury is required, four main methods are used: meniscal repair (i.e. suturing), meniscectomy (i.e. resection), meniscal scaffold (i.e. resection with suturing in a biodegradable/resorbable scaffold), and meniscal allograft transplant (i.e. total replacement with cadaveric tissue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Meniscal repair surgery (i.e. suturing) is the most preserving procedure and is conducted when a tear is surgically repairable to prevent progressive arthrosis and long-term functional decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Subsequent procedures are progressively more destructive to native tissue. In cases where the meniscus cannot be repaired and the patient is not a viable candidate for a successful meniscal scaffold or allograft transplant, the current standard practice is partial meniscectomy. Partial meniscectomy results in changes to the balance of load-bearing in the knee and increasing the load on the articular cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], predisposing the patient to accelerated cartilage breakdown and osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Partial meniscectomy continues to be a debatable topic in the treatment continuum among older patients as recent studies appear to indicate inconclusive observed differences in outcomes between non-operative treatment and partial meniscectomy in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Additionally, a recent consensus statement by the British Association of Surgery for the Knee (BASK) Meniscal Working Group, developed using a modified Delphi process, indicates that the presence of a &#x02018;target lesion&#x02019; such as a displaced flap tear forms the basis of how to select patients for partial meniscectomy, with a focus on removing the mechanical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, clinical studies have also indicated that some patients undergoing arthroscopic resection continue to experience pain, which has a detrimental impact on a patient&#x02019;s quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Patients unresponsive to these surgical interventions may ultimately undergo reconstructive techniques such as meniscal scaffolds or allografts, osteotomy (tibial or femoral) or knee replacement to relieve symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Given the limitations associated with existing treatments, there is a clinical need to fill the treatment gap between arthroscopic meniscal resection and the invasive, end-of-line surgical interventions. The NUsurface<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> prosthesis (Active Implants LLC, Memphis, TN, USA) has been developed to act as a synthetic medial meniscus (MM) replacement in patients experiencing persistent knee pain post MM surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The prosthesis does not require fixation to bone or soft tissue due to its polymer construction material and design. The prosthesis mimics the function of the natural meniscus by redistributing loads transmitted across the knee joint, thereby offering a treatment option between minimally invasive meniscus surgeries and total knee replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Existing treatment guidelines related to patient management post-resection are weak, however the study by Zaslav et al. has shown the potential for treatment of post-meniscectomy knee symptoms to result in improved patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, this study aims to assess the potential for this novel technique to reduce costs for the health care system by delaying the need to progress to a knee replacement surgery and improve patient outcomes in terms of pain, function, and activities of daily living. In order to explore these economic and clinical implications, we performed a model-based economic evaluation to estimate the cost effectiveness of introducing the MM replacement prosthesis as a treatment option for patients in the UK suffering from medial compartment pain following prior partial meniscectomy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par11">An economic decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the costs and effectiveness associated with introducing the MM replacement prosthesis into clinical practice for the treatment of patients following prior partial meniscectomy compared with current practice. The current treatment pathways for this patient population and the impact that introducing the intervention would have on the treatment pathways were used as a basis for developing the model structure. Existing clinical guidelines and potential clinical outcomes associated with the intervention were used as a basis for developing the model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Data from the Verifying the Effectiveness of the NUsurface<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> System (VENUS; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02108496) randomized clinical trial, with a 2-year follow-up period, were used as key inputs in informing the effectiveness of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The trial was also a key source of information in designing the model-based analysis. VENUS was a multi-centred, prospective, randomized, interventional, superiority study in which patients with persistent knee pain following one or more previous partial meniscectomies were randomized to receive either NUsurface or were treated with the non-surgical standard of care. As outlined in the study, existing treatment options are limited (non-surgical treatment options include intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid and/or corticosteroids; prescription and/or non-prescription oral medications; physical therapy; bracing; etc.) and clinical practice guidelines are weak. The study assessed pain and functional outcomes (knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score [KOOS] pain and overall) as well as device-related complications at regular follow-up points and was used as a key source of data in populating the model base-case, i.e., use of MM replacement prosthesis. The impact of both treatment strategies on progression to end-stage surgical intervention with replacement, adverse event rate, and QoL were used as a basis for calculating the costs and health outcomes associated with each strategy over the time horizon of the cost-effectiveness analysis. The face validity of the model was confirmed by orthopaedic surgeons involved in this analysis of the investigational device (MS, JM, TS).</p><p id="Par13">The population in the model was a hypothetical cohort of adult patients (mean age of 50&#x000a0;years, based on data from the VENUS randomized clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]) who have experienced a meniscal tear, have undergone medial partial meniscectomy 6&#x000a0;months previously (or longer), and are experiencing persistent medial compartment pain and are requesting further treatment. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK recommends that the time horizon of an economic analysis should be long enough to sufficiently capture all differences in costs and benefits between interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], therefore a lifetime time horizon was used. For costs and benefits occurring after the first year of the model, the UK-recommended discount rate of 3.5% was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. All costs in the model were considered from a UK National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS) perspective, and the model was developed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). An overview of the model structure is presented in the next section, followed by a detailed overview of all input parameters used in the model.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Model Overview</title><p id="Par14">A Markov model was developed, consisting of 10 independent health states {post index procedure, post revision surgery, post replacement, post replacement and revision, post removal, post removal and revision, post knee replacement [unicompartmental or partial knee replacement (UKR)/total knee replacement (TKR)], post first UKR/TKR revision, post second UKR/TKR revision and death}. A cycle length of 6 months was applied on the basis of the timing of outcomes reported in the VENUS trial and based on input from clinical experts involved in this research study (MS, JM, TS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Based on data from the VENUS randomized controlled clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the model included all patients who had undergone a partial meniscectomy &#x02265;6 months prior to enrolment and were randomized to either undergo non-surgical management (current practice/control arm) or to receive the MM replacement using a NUsurface prosthesis (intervention arm) to help alleviate pain and manage the condition. All patients begin in the model at a point where they are experiencing medial compartment pain following a prior partial meniscectomy procedure (&#x02018;post index procedure&#x02019;). Therefore, all patients will start in the &#x02018;post index procedure 6m&#x02019; (6 months) health state. In the intervention arm, it was assumed that patients will undergo the implant procedure at the beginning of the model, however they also start in the &#x02018;post index procedure 6m&#x02019; health state.</p><p id="Par16">Data from the VENUS trial indicated that QoL changes over time following each procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, after the first cycle, patients transit to the &#x02018;post index procedure 12m&#x02019; health state and a different QoL weight is applied. This will be continued until they move to the post index procedure &#x0003e;&#x000a0;24&#x000a0;m health state. Given the impact of any knee surgical treatment on patient QoL, we have assumed that if patients have any surgical treatment, they move back to the initial post-surgical health states, i.e., health states at 6 months. Therefore, if a patient receives an additional surgical treatment within 6 months following a surgical treatment, the patient will remain in the same health state. In the control arm, patients could have a surgery at any time, which would either be a UKR/TKR or non-UKR/TKR surgery; in this event, they will either transit to the post UKR/TKR or post revision 6m health state. Similarly, patients in the intervention arm may need an unplanned arthroscopy or replacement or removal, in which case they will transit to the corresponding health state. Following a device replacement, if patients need an unplanned arthroscopy, he/she will transit to the post replace-revision 6m health state. This enables an estimation of the number of replacements that patients have received.</p><p id="Par17">In any cycle of the model, patients undergoing either strategy can experience what is defined as &#x02018;failure&#x02019;, meaning that they progress to subsequent surgical treatment (current practice arm) or undergo a device removal of the prosthesis (intervention arm). In the current practice arm of the model, subsequent surgeries included arthroscopy, tibial osteotomy, osteochondral allograft, and other surgeries except knee replacement. In this event, patients would progress to the &#x02018;post revision surgery&#x02019; health state. Patients will then either remain in this health state over time, progress to a unicompartmental or total knee replacement at any point (&#x02018;post total or partial knee replacement [TKR or UKR]&#x02019;), die (&#x02018;death&#x02019;) or undergo further surgery, in which case they would return to the starting point of the &#x02018;post revision surgery&#x02019; health state. If patients progress to the knee replacement health state, the possibility of undergoing three knee replacements in total (i.e., initial surgery and two subsequent revisions, if required) is modelled, in view of the initial mean age of 50&#x000a0;years at the start of this model.</p><p id="Par18">In the intervention arm of the model, patients experiencing &#x02018;failure&#x02019; progress to the &#x02018;post removal&#x02019; health state since removal of the device in the intervention arm constitutes a clinical trial failure. If patients experience an unplanned arthroscopy, they move to the &#x02018;post revision surgery&#x02019; health state. In the intervention arm, the possibilities of requiring a replacement procedure (&#x02018;post replace&#x02019;), requiring a replacement in combination with an unplanned arthroscopy (&#x02018;post replace and revision&#x02019;) and the possibility of undergoing a removal in combination with any one of the surgical interventions outlined previously (&#x02018;post removal and revision&#x02019;) are also modelled. Patients in these health states can progress back and forth between health states over the model time horizon, unless they are in one of the &#x02018;post removal&#x02019; health states, in which case patients will have had the prosthesis removed and cannot undergo a subsequent replacement. As in the current practice arm, patients may progress to the &#x02018;post total or partial knee replacement (TKR or UKR)&#x02019; health state, or to the post removal-revision health state or die at any point. Therefore, the probability of death from other causes in each cycle is also modelled.</p><p id="Par19">In addition to the core treatment pathways that were modelled and described above, the probabilities of experiencing a range of clinical complications associated with each treatment strategy were also considered. These will be described in further detail in the next section.

The 6-monthly failure rates associated with MM replacement using the NUsurface prosthesis and the conventional treatment strategy were derived from the VENUS clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (up to 24 months based on the 2-year follow-up duration of the trial). In order to understand details around &#x02018;time to events&#x02019;, i.e., time to failure and longer-term outcomes, parametric survival analyses were undertaken, the methods of which are outlined in Sect.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">2.2.2</xref>.</p><p id="Par22">The potential surgical treatments that patients in either arm of the model could progress to are outlined in Sect.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref>. The percentage of patients requiring knee replacement (arthroplasty) on a yearly basis, in each arm of the model, were derived from a previous systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and from the VENUS clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The annual failure rate associated with a knee replacement arthroplasty (i.e., reoperation/revision) was derived from a previous clinical study comparing medial versus lateral arthroscopic partial meniscectomy on stable knees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and a cost-effectiveness analysis of meniscal repair versus partial meniscectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], with this rate declining over time. Failure rates associated with a revision knee arthroplasty procedure were derived from the same two studies. Clinical probabilities of events related to the prosthesis were considered in the model and these included repositioning of the prosthesis, replacement of the prosthetic implant, unplanned arthroscopy, and deep vein thrombosis. The 6-monthly probabilities of each event were derived from the VENUS clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Complications associated with surgical procedures, including arthroscopy, arthroplasty and high tibial osteotomy, were also considered in the model and are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1"

For the intervention arm, these analyses were carried out to estimate the probability of undergoing device removal, repositioning, replacement, unplanned arthroscopy, and progression to knee replacement health states at different time points in the model. These recognized techniques involve exploring the relationship between the survival of a patient, a distribution, and explanatory variables to estimate the probability of an event occurring over a defined time horizon.</p><p id="Par24">Failure in the control group is defined as having any surgical intervention (except arthroplasty). The surgical interventions include arthroscopy, tibial osteotomy, osteochondral allograft, and posterolateral compartment reconstruction.

The failure percentage is the likelihood of having surgical treatment in each cycle, which was estimated in the parametric survival analysis utilizing data from the VENUS clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and was applied until the patient transitions to the arthroplasty health states.</p><p id="Par25">Multiple different hazard functions were sampled for failure in the control group based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values, and the exponential distribution was the best fit; therefore the transition probability is constant over time. This assumption was confirmed by the clinicians involved in this research study (MS, JM, TS), who agreed that the patterns were clinically plausible. The parametric survival models were all conducted based on the NICE Decision Support Unit (DSU) recommendations for conducting survival analysis. Due to the nature of the intervention (NUsurface) and treatment pathway in the control group, as well as post-implant outcomes (removal, replacement, repositioning), we could not define identical failure or events that apply to both treatment arms; therefore, individual survival curves were fitted. This method provides the most robust estimates of long-term pattern and probabilities of events over the long-term.</p><p id="Par26">In electronic supplementary material (ESM) Appendix 1, details of each parametric survival analysis conducted, which include the selected distribution and figures representing patient survival, are presented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Utilities</title><p id="Par27">The health state utility values associated with being in the post index procedure health state, i.e., post partial meniscectomy, at different time points were derived from the VENUS clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

One of the most common procedures used to rectify the issue, partial meniscectomy, as well as non-operative therapies, may not improve symptoms, resulting in deterioration in knee function and the potential for eventual knee replacement surgery, either partial or total [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, the meniscal tear is associated with high health care costs and a substantial disease burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. A novel prosthetic device, the NUsurface prosthesis, developed and designed to act as an artificial meniscus for patients still experiencing pain following meniscectomy, has the potential to reduce the number of patients progressing to end-of-line treatments. In this analysis, we sought to assess the cost effectiveness of introducing this technology in the UK health care system.</p><p id="Par39">Results indicate that the intervention improves QoL over the lifetime of patients and although costlier on an individual patient basis, it is a cost-effective use of NHS resources given that the incremental cost per QALY gained (&#x000a3;5011) is below the NICE WTP threshold of &#x000a3;20,000 per QALY. The base-case analysis shows an increase in QALYs of 1.31 per patient with NUsurface, with an increase in costs of &#x000a3;6,589. The QALY gain is driven by the difference in QoL between patients in the intervention and control arms at 6, 12, 24 and post 24 months, plus procedure-related mortality (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Data from the VENUS trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] indicate that patients have a higher quality-of-life at regular follow-up time points following use of NUsurface compared with use of the non-surgical standard of care. In this study, it is reported that osteoarthritis outcome scores (as measured by the KOOS) were significantly greater following use of the intervention, compared with the control group. Similarly, KOOS-assessed QoL scores were significantly greater in the intervention arm at follow-up. The higher number of surgeries among patients in the control arm, as well as associated procedure-related death (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), were further drivers of this difference in QALYs over the lifetime. It is also worth noting that conservative cost estimates were used for some of the surgical procedures included in the analysis, such as meniscal allograft transplant, which led to a conservative estimate of the ICER.</p><p id="Par40">Results of the analysis also indicated that in the intervention arm, the per patient cost of device replacement was higher than the initial cost of NUsurface implantation. This was due to the fact that among those retaining the device, replacement with a new device would be required on average every 3.5 years; therefore, over the long-term, the average cost per patient of replacement exceeds the average cost of the original procedure. The potential of the prosthesis to be cost effective was robust to most of the scenario analyses conducted, with the ICER only exceeding &#x000a3;20,000 when the time horizon of the analysis was reduced to 5&#x000a0;years. Shortening the duration of the analysis means that the longer-term clinical benefits associated with the intervention are not captured. However, the reported ICER of &#x000a3;22,022 from this analysis was still within the commonly accepted WTP range of &#x000a3;20,000&#x02013;&#x000a3;30,000 per QALY.</p><p id="Par41">Previous work has been carried out exploring the economic impact of treating meniscal tear patients with meniscectomy compared with non-surgical management.

Notably, costs increased significantly among those patients who went on to have total knee arthroplasty ($32,197 [SD $169]), highlighting the sharp increase in costs for those patients who progress to end-of-line treatments. Similarly, Barnds et al. conducted a cost comparison among meniscal tear patients receiving arthroscopic partial meniscectomy and non-surgical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and found that costs among those patients undergoing meniscectomy were significantly higher ($3843 vs. $411).

Katz et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial among 351 patients with a symptomatic meniscal tear to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic partial meniscectomy with non-surgical therapy. Their assessments at 6- and 12-month timepoints showed that there was no significant improvement in pain and functional status among those patients who underwent surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

Additional clinical evidence from a separate, ongoing, single-arm trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;115) studying the safety and efficacy of MM replacement using NUsurface prosthesis through 5-year follow-up (&#x02018;Safety Using NUsurface&#x02019; study [SUN]; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02483988), will be able to provide additional evidence, beyond the available 2-year randomized controlled trial evidence evaluated in this cost-effectiveness study, upon the conclusion of that trial. It is worth noting that there was an information gap related to the use and costs for some of the non-surgical care included in the base-case model that are not available from the information used to populate the model. To address these information gaps, we relied on clinical expert opinion and data from a UK-based study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. An additional limitation of the analysis is that given that this economic analysis was performed from the NHS and PSS perspective, treatment options such hyaluronic acid injections, which are commonly administered through private care in the UK, are not represented in the base-case model. Despite this, we believe that this robust cost-effectiveness model based on comparative 2-year randomized controlled trial data enables exploration of the intervention&#x02019;s potential cost effectiveness in a UK setting, in what is the first analysis of its kind. Moreover, the estimated cost per QALY is a conservative estimate due to the application of conservative cost estimates for some of the surgical procedures, such as meniscal allograft transplant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par44">Introduction of the NUsurface prosthesis as a treatment option for patients continuing to experience medial compartment knee pain post previous partial meniscectomy is likely to be a cost-effective use of health care resources in the UK.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="41669_2022_336_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 262 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to express their gratitude to Ms Diana Karff (RHIA, CCS, CPC) and Dr Mohsen Rezaei Hemami for their assistance during this research.</p></ack><notes><title>Declarations</title><notes id="FPar1" notes-type="funding"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par45">This report is independent research funded by Active Implants LLC.

Although the C-terminal actin-binding domain ABS3 of talin is required for function, it binds weakly to actin in solution. We show that ABS3 binds actin strongly only when subjected to mechanical forces comparable to those generated by the cytoskeleton. Moreover, the interaction between ABS3 and actin depends strongly on the direction of force in a manner predicted to organize actin to facilitate adhesion growth and efficient cytoskeletal force generation. These characteristics can explain how force sensing by talin helps to nucleate adhesions precisely when and where they are required to transmit force between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Focal adhesions (FAs) are large, integrin-based protein complexes that link cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM). FAs form only when and where they are necessary to transmit force between the cellular cytoskeleton and the ECM, but how this occurs remains poorly understood. Talin is a 270-kDa adaptor protein that links integrins to filamentous (F)-actin and recruits additional components during FA assembly in a force-dependent manner. Cell biological and developmental data demonstrate that the third and C-terminal F-actin&#x02013;binding site (ABS3) of talin is required for normal FA formation. However, purified ABS3 binds F-actin only weakly in solution. We used a single molecule optical trap assay to examine how and whether ABS3 binds F-actin under physiologically relevant mechanical loads. We find that ABS3 forms a catch bond with F-actin when force is applied toward the pointed end of the actin filament, with binding lifetimes &#x0003e;100-fold longer than when force is applied toward the barbed end. Long-lived bonds to F-actin under load require the ABS3 C-terminal dimerization domain, whose cleavage has been reported to regulate FA turnover. Our results support a mechanism in which talin ABS3 preferentially binds to and orients actin filaments with barbed ends facing the cell periphery, thus nucleating long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. We suggest that talin ABS3 may function as a molecular AND gate that allows FA growth only when sufficient integrin density, F-actin polarization, and mechanical tension are simultaneously present.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>talin</kwd><kwd>focal adhesion</kwd><kwd>catch bond</kwd><kwd>F-actin</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">HHS | National Institutes of Health (NIH)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">R01GM114462</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Leanna M Owen</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Nicolas A.

Adhesion to the ECM is mediated in large part by integrins, a family of heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that assemble into large adhesion complexes, here referred to generically as focal adhesions (FAs). FA assembly is precisely controlled, such that FAs form only when and where they are necessary to transmit force between the cytoskeleton and the ECM. However, the mechanism by which mechanical force regulates FA nucleation and growth remains poorly understood.</p><p>The connection between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton is mediated in large part by talin, a 270-kDa protein that directly binds integrins, F-actin, and other FA components (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>) (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we first more closely examined the dimerization of ABS3, which had been reported to form a constitutive dimer (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We used a fluorescence polarization assay to characterize the association of ABS3 with a fluorescently tagged DD peptide (amino acids 2,494 to 2,541).

We observed no binding events longer than 0.8 s in the presence of applied force (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2109329119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. 8</ext-link>). Furthermore, no single actin filament sampled resulted in more than one binding event longer than 0.5 s, making the determination of the long-binding direction infeasible for this dataset. Thus, N-terminal dimerization alone was not sufficient to rescue long-lived, polarized binding in the presence of load.</p><p>For NTD-ABS3, forced N-terminal dimerization slightly increased no-load binding in the optical trap assay (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2109329119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></ext-link>) but did not significantly alter binding in the presence of load (<xref rid="fig03" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>). This degree of similarity suggests that ABS3 also forms stable, load-bearing bonds to F-actin only when its C-terminal dimerization domain is present. Although it must be interpreted with care, we also did not observe substeps for the dissociation of ABS3 or NTD-ABS3 from F-actin, which if present would provide evidence for sequential unbinding of individual ABS3 domains. In total, a reasonable interpretation is that 1) definitively monomeric ABS3 (ABS3-&#x00394;DD) binds F-actin only transiently under load, 2) the DD is required for stable F-actin binding under load, and 3) each dissociation step we observe reflects the coordinated detachment within our temporal resolution of an ABS3 dimer from F-actin. This is consistent with electron microscopy data in which antiparallel ABS3 dimers saddle actin filaments, but no ABS3 monomers are reported to bind (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). How the DD&#x02019;s intrinsic actin-binding activity and its C-terminal dimerization dynamics contribute to ABS3&#x02019;s load-dependent binding behavior has yet to be determined. Interestingly, 6 to 10 pN of force, which in our experiments yields mean binding lifetimes of &#x0223c;10 s, would correspond to 3 to 5 pN of load per individual talin dimer half. This value is in good accord with measurements of typical loads borne by integrins in living cells (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and by talin in proximity to ABS3&#x000a0;(<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s2"><title>Discussion</title><p content-type="flushleft">Previous studies indicate that the talin-binding partner vinculin forms a directional catch bond with F-actin: like talin, the bond between vinculin and F-actin is stabilized when load is oriented toward the pointed end of the actin filament (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, both the force dependence and directional preference of ABS3 are extreme&#x02014;the mean measured lifetimes and the actin polarity preference each increase more than 100-fold under load, enhancements that are &#x0223c;10-fold larger than those observed for vinculin. Indirect evidence suggests that talin ABS3 and vinculin may act in concert: knockout of vinculin worsens ABS3 mutant phenotypes in mammalian cells in culture and in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and expression of constitutively active vinculin can compensate for ABS3 disruption in cell culture (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Whether the talin ABS1 and ABS2 domains and, more broadly, the many other F-actin&#x02013;binding proteins present at FAs show similar directional sensitivity is not known. However, at a conceptual level, this requires only a binding interaction with F-actin that is asymmetric with respect to the intrinsic polarity of the actin filament as, for example, is seen in the electron microscopy structures of ABS3 and the vinculin F-actin&#x02013;binding domain bound to F-actin (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Based on these observations, it is interesting to speculate that asymmetric regulation of dissociation rates by force may be a general property of protein&#x02013;actin bonds.</p><p>How exactly cells regulate the number, size, and placement of FAs has been unclear. As a partial answer, we speculate that ABS3 may function as a molecular AND gate that limits the formation of FAs to highly specific circumstances (<xref rid="fig03" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>). As suggested previously, it is plausible that integrins must be of sufficient local areal density to anchor talin dimers at both <italic toggle="yes">N</italic> termini (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Furthermore, our results show that substantial, &#x0003e;5-pN loads are required for ABS3 to form long-lived bonds to F-actin. This condition requires that load-bearing connections between the ECM, integrin, and talin are intact and that the proximal ECM is sufficiently stiff to resist cell-generated forces. Finally, load must be oriented toward the F-actin pointed end. This stabilizes oriented F-actin that is under load due to either barbed-end polymerization forces or tension generated by non-muscle myosin II while allowing misoriented F-actin to escape. Simulation suggests that the resulting polarization of F-actin can potentially drive cellular-scale organization of the actin cytoskeleton to generate efficient traction and produce directional cell migration (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). We therefore propose that the F-actin&#x02013;binding properties of ABS3 have evolved to limit FA formation to when and where a force-transmitting anchorage between the cytoskeleton and the ECM is required. Further work is required to test this hypothesis with in&#x000a0;vivo experiments and to test whether a similar form of autoregulation may apply to other cellular adhesion complexes.</p><p>Our assay design uses fast ramp loading at &#x0223c;3,000 pN &#x022c5; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> followed by constant stage position because this makes subsequent data analysis and model building more straightforward than in the case of experiments carried out with time-varying loads. Relatively few data comment directly on how talin ABS3 may be loaded in&#x000a0;vivo. F-actin retrograde flow rates vary between and within cells, with some studies reporting flow rates ranging from 10 to as high as 600 nm &#x022c5; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). The latter velocity is comparable to that at which non-muscle myosin IIA is predicted to translocate F-actin at physiological temperature and low load (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The stiffness of the molecular linkages that anchor talin ABS3 is not certain, but a reasonable value based on the stiffness of the talin rod domain is &#x0223c;1 pN &#x022c5; nm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, yielding predicted in&#x000a0;vivo loading rates ranging from 10 to 600 pN &#x022c5; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The properties of ABS3 may thus allow it to capture and anchor F-actin undergoing retrograde flow, consistent with the observation that ABS3 mutations that disrupt actin binding also prevent retrograde flow-dependent force transfer to the talin rod and talin-dependent slowing of lamellipodial actin flow (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). More broadly, the exponential increase in binding lifetimes with load between 0 and &#x0223c;10 pN (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2109329119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. 9</ext-link>) means that repeated interactions with F-actin will eventually result in an encounter in which an ABS3 dimer surpasses a threshold force and becomes stably attached to F-actin. Understanding how the dynamical properties of ABS3 and other F-actin&#x02013;binding proteins influence the assembly and dynamics of FAs constitutes an interesting target for future investigations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4"><title>Constructs.</title><p>The HaloTag-ABS3 expression vector was constructed by inserting the DNA encoding the HaloTag, a linker sequence, and the human talin-1 C-terminal actin-binding domain (amino acids 2,293 to 2,541) into the pPROEX HTa expression vector to generate an in-frame fusion consisting of a 6xHis-tag, HaloTag, 12-residue linker (SGLGGSGGGGSG), and ABS3.

Briefly, a bead is held in each trap laser, and the positions of the detection lasers are adjusted to center on the trapped beads. A calibration experiment is performed for each trap that relates the signal of the detection laser on the quadrant photodiode (QPD) to the bead position and trap stiffness. An actin filament is then attached to both trapped beads. The trap lasers (and their trapped beads) are separated until the actin filament is taut. Because the actin filament is held taut, the trapped beads no longer occupy their equilibrium positions in the center of the laser traps. The detection laser is then repositioned to center on the trapped beads to ensure the trapped beads remain in the linear range of the detention signal during binding events. The calibration for each trap is applied to the QPD signal to determine a position (in nm) or equivalent force (in pN) for each trapped bead relative to the detection laser. Data are downsampled to 1 kHz using the &#x0201c;decimate&#x0201d; function in MATLAB. The temporal boundaries of binding events were picked with custom software (MATLAB) and verified manually. The net force on the talin/F-actin bond is determined as described previously (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>): When a binding event occurs, one of the beads is pulled further from its equilibrium position while the other bead either moves toward or falls into the center of its trap.

Binding events shorter than the 150-ms stage oscillation pause time and longer than 20 ms were detected and reported.

EGFR signal termination is initiated by EGFR internalization, followed by trafficking through endosomes, and degradation in lysosomes. How this process is regulated is still poorly understood. Here, we show that hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS), a key protein in the EGFR trafficking pathway, is dynamically modified by a single sugar N-acetylglucosamine. This modification inhibits EGFR trafficking from endosomes to lysosomes, leading to the accumulation of EGFR and prolonged signaling. This study provides an important insight into diseases with aberrant growth factor signaling, such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Ligand-stimulated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling plays fundamental roles in normal cell physiology, such as cell growth, cell proliferation, and cell survival. Deregulation of EGFR signaling contributes to the development and progression of diseases including cancer. Despite its essential role in biology, the mechanisms by which EGFR signaling is regulated in cells are still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that <italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-linked <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification serves as an important regulator of EGFR intracellular trafficking and degradation. Mechanistically, O-GlcNAcylation of hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS), a key protein in EGFR intraluminal sorting pathway, inhibits HGS interaction with signal-transducing adaptor molecule (STAM), thereby impairing the formation of endosomal sorting complex required for transport-0 (ESCRT-0). Moreover, O-GlcNAcylation increases HGS ubiquitination and decreases its protein stability in cells. Consequently, HGS O-GlcNAcylation inhibits EGFR intraluminal sorting and lysosomal degradation, leading to the accumulation of EGFR and prolonged EGFR signaling in cells. Furthermore, HGS glycosylation is demonstrated to promote tumor growth in the xenograft study and chemoresistance in liver carcinoma cells. Thus, our study reveals a role of O-GlcNAcylation in regulating receptor tyrosine kinase endocytic trafficking and signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>O-GlcNAcylation</kwd><kwd>EGFR</kwd><kwd>endosomal sorting</kwd><kwd>membrane receptors</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">As the prototypic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) senses extracellular growth signals and transduces the signal inside the cell to regulate various important cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and survival (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). On the other hand, aberrant EGFR activity is frequently linked to diseases such as cancer (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). For example, EGFR mutations that resulted in EGFR hyper-activation have been identified clinically in several types of cancers (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Consequently, EGFR has become a therapeutic target for the development of anticancer drugs (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>EGFR expression levels and signaling strength are tightly controlled in cells. The key mechanism to terminate EGFR signaling is the intraluminal sorting and lysosomal degradation of EGFR (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Upon ligand stimulation, EGFR undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues, leading to the activation of EGFR. The activated EGFR is rapidly internalized through the clathrin-dependent mechanism, and targeted to early endosomes, where EGFR signaling persists. A population of EGFR molecules recycles back to the plasma membrane, while the remaining EGFR molecules are sorted into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of the multivesicular body (MVB). The MVB then fuses with the lysosome, which results in EGFR degradation and signal termination.</p><p>The intraluminal sorting of endosomal EGFR constitutes a key step during EGFR signal termination. This is governed by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machineries (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). ESCRT-0 consists of hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS) and signal-transducing adaptor molecule (STAM) (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). HGS is a cytosolic protein, which recognizes and recruits ubiquitinated protein cargo (including EGFR) to initiate the intraluminal sorting event. HGS is shown to interact with various proteins on the early endosomes to regulate the sorting and degradation process. Despite its critical role in EGFR endosomal trafficking and degradation, the regulation of HGS at the molecular level and how it influences EGFR signaling are poorly understood.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">O</italic>-linked <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), a monosaccharide modification of serine and/or threonine residues of cellular proteins, has recently emerged as a key regulator of various important biological processes, including gene transcription, stress response, metabolic homeostasis, and immune regulation (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In cells, a single set of enzymes&#x02014;O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAc hydrolyze (OGA)&#x02014;are responsible for the addition and removal of O-GlcNAc modification, respectively. Given the critical role of O-GlcNAcylation in normal physiology, increasing evidence has now demonstrated that deregulation of O-GlcNAcylation is closely associated with the development and progression of various diseases, including neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A key question in exploring the biology of O-GlcNAcylation is to elucidate the protein-specific glycosylation function in cells, which requires detailed mechanistic studies at the molecular level.</p><p>Previously, we developed a mass spectrometry-based strategy for quantitative profiling of O-GlcNAcylated proteins using a photocleavable probe (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). HGS was reproducibly identified to possess at least twofold increase in glycosylation levels in drug-resistant liver cancer cells than drug-sensitive cells. Because the function of HGS glycosylation has not been studied before, we decided to carry out a detailed investigation. Our results demonstrate that HGS O-GlcNAcylation decreases its interaction with STAM and impairs the formation of ESCRT-0 at the early endosome. In addition, O-GlcNAcylation increases HGS ubiquitination and promotes the degradation of HGS. Consequently, HGS O-GlcNAcylation inhibits intraluminal sorting and lysosomal degradation of EGFR, leading to the accumulation of EGFR at the early endosome and prolonged EGFR signaling in cells.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>HGS is Dynamically Modified by O-GlcNAc.</title><p>Our previous proteomic study identified HGS as an O-GlcNAcylated protein with high confidence (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). To verify the O-GlcNAcylation on HGS, we employed a widely used chemoenzymatic labeling method (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Flag-tagged HGS was ectopically expressed in 293T cells. Proteins from cell lysates were used as substrates to perform an in&#x000a0;vitro enzymatic reaction in which an azido-<italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAz) was transferred from the corresponding nucleotide sugar (UDP-GalNAz) onto O-GlcNAc by a galactosyltransferase. Labeled proteins were subsequently conjugated with a biotin-containing alkynl molecule via the Cu(I)-mediated [3&#x02009;+&#x02009;2] cycloaddition reaction. After capture and enrichment with streptavidin-coated beads, bound proteins were eluted and immunoblotted with the Flag antibody. A clear immunoblotting signal was observed in the labeled samples but was absent in the control samples in which the galactosyltransferase was omitted (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>). Expectedly, coexpression of OGT, or inhibition of OGA with Thimet-G (TMG, a specific inhibitor of OGA), substantially increased the blotting signal (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>). In addition, we immunoprecipitated endogenous HGS proteins from different cell lines and readily detected immunoblotting signals with a pan-O-GlcNAc antibody (RL-2) (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>). Consistently, treatment of an OGT inhibitor OSMI-4 (<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) substantially reduced the blotting signals.

To further validate glycosylation sites, we mutated each serine/threonine residue to alanine to generate singlet and triplet mutants of HGS and subsequently determined the glycosylation levels of the mutants. The results showed that while single-alanine mutants displayed comparable glycosylation levels as WT HGS, the triple-alanine mutant displayed a significant reduction of glycosylation levels (<xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 <italic toggle="yes">H</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">I</italic></xref>). The lack of appreciable change of glycosylation in the single-alanine mutants might be due to the compensatory effect by the nearby glycosylation site (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).

The internalized EGFR was targeted to the early endosome (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We analyzed the coimmunostaining of EGFR with early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1), a cellular marker for early endosomes, after 30 min of EGF stimulation. In cells expressing WT or 3SA HGS, EGFR was colocalized with EEA1 at comparable levels, in the presence or absence of OSMI-4 (<xref rid="fig03" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>). This indicated that HGS O-GlcNAcylation did not affect EGFR targeting to the early endosome.

These results suggest that HGS O-GlcNAcylation affects EGFR sorting from the early endosome.</p><p>From the early endosome, EGFR is further sorted to the late endosome/lysosome for degradation.

Similar observations were shown with OSMI-4 treatment in cells expressing WT HGS, but not in cells expressing 3SA HGS. Thus, reduction of HGS glycosylation is associated with enhanced EGFR trafficking to the late endosome/lysosome, which is consistent with the increased degradation of EGFR.</p><p>Last, we quantified EGFR recycling back to the plasma membrane by flow cytometry (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).

To further delineate the molecular mechanism of impeded EGFR trafficking into lysosomes, we used electron microscopy (EM) approach. Stable SK cells expressing WT or 3SA HGS were serum starved, and then treated with or without EGF for 40 min (<xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>).

In this assay, when EGFR is effectively sorted into MVB, its cytoplasmic tail domain is protected from protease digestion and can be detected using epitope-specific antibodies.

Next, we examined whether HGS O-GlcNAcylation affects ESCRT-0 formation. In stable SK cell lines, the association of HGS and STAM was probed using the coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. We generated various truncated HGS proteins based on the predicted domains, and analyzed their interaction with STAM in cells (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2107453119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S5</ext-link>). The results showed that the PSAP domain (aa 280&#x02013;460) that contains the glycosylation sites (S297, S299, and S300) was indispensable for the HGS-STAM interaction. Further, 3SA HGS pulled down significantly more STAM than WT HGS did (<xref rid="fig04" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>).

The results showed that 3SA HGS displayed a slower degradation rate than WT HGS, and that OSMI-4 treatment slowed WT HGS degradation but had no effect on 3SA HGS, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation promotes HGS protein degradation. Consistent with the previous report, HGS degradation was mediated through the lysosome-pathway, but not the proteosome-pathway (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2107453119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S8 <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C</italic></ext-link>) (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).

In order to show that the difference of cell proliferation was due to the difference of EGFR expression mediated by HGS O-GlcNAcylation, we partially knock down EGFR in SK cells expressing WT HGS, or modestly overexpressed EGFR in SK cells expressing 3SA HGS, and further compared the cell proliferation. The results showed that EGFR knockdown reduced cell proliferation in SK cells expressing WT-HGS, while EGFR overexpression increased cell proliferation in SK cells expressing 3SA-HGS (<xref rid="fig05" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic toggle="yes">A</italic></xref>). Thus, this study supports the notion that the anti-proliferative effect of 3SA HGS was driven by EGFR.

Considering the critical role of HGS O-GlcNAcylation in regulating EGFR degradation and signaling as revealed in this study, we postulate that HGS O-GlcNAcylation may contribute to sorafenib resistance in liver cancer cells. We first verified the upregulation of HGS glycosylation in HepG2-R cells using the chemoenzymatic labeling method.

An estimate of 40% of HGS in the HepG2-R cells was glycosylated based on calculation of the glycosylated protein versus total HGS. Next, we investigated the effect of HGS O-GlcNAcylation on EGFR expression and downstream signaling. We used HepG2-R cells as the parental cell lines to generate stable cells expressing Flag-tagged WT or 3SA HGS with a simultaneous depletion of the endogenous HGS (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2107453119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S10</ext-link>). Analysis of HGS glycosylation in the cell lines confirmed that 3SA HGS contained a minimal level of glycosylation (<xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">B</italic></xref>). Consistent with the above results, EGFR expression and activation were significantly reduced in HepG2-R cells expressing 3SA HGS (<xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that sustained activation of EGFR downstream signaling, particularly the MEK/ERK pathway, contributed to sorafenib resistance (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).

Such mechanisms are critical for maintaining proper cell signaling and metabolism. Here, we show that O-GlcNAcylation, a prevalent form of protein glycosylation, positively regulates EGFR signaling by blocking EGF-induced EGFR intraluminal sorting and degradation (<xref rid="fig06" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic toggle="yes">G</italic></xref>). Mechanistically, O-GlcNAcylation of HGS inhibits ESCRT-0 complex formation, a key regulatory point of intraluminal sorting process, by decreasing HGS-STAM interaction and promoting lysosomal degradation of HGS. HGS has been shown to regulate the degradation of many membrane proteins, including VEGR, G protein-coupled receptors, and E-cadherin (<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Thus, our study suggests a general mechanism by which O-GlcNAc regulates the prosurvival signaling in cells.</p><p>The process of endosomal trafficking of activated membrane receptors is initiated by the ubiquitination of the receptors. Subsequent trafficking pathways are governed by the evolutionarily conserved ESCRT machinery. Among the various ESCRT complexes, ESCRT-0 functions to capture ubiquitinated protein cargos and target them to the early endosome. ESCRT-0 consists of two major subunits HGS and STAM. HGS is shown to recognize ubiquitinated protein cargos through its intrinsic ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM). This interaction is critical for the initiation of the intraluminal sorting and degradation process. On the other hand, HGS itself can be ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase Nedd4. HGS ubiquitination forms an intramolecular interaction with its intrinsic UIM (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), which in turns blocks the interaction with the ubiquitinated protein cargos. Previous studies have shown that increasing HGS ubiquitination blocks the ILV sorting of EGFR by inhibiting the interaction between HGS and EGFR (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In our study, we showed that WT HGS possesses higher ubiquitination level than 3SA HGS, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation renders HGS a better substrate for Nedd4 to promote its ubiquitination. Consistently, more Nedd4 were immunoprecipitated with WT HGS than with 3SA HGS. Consequently, the glycosylation-induced ubiquitination inhibits HGS-EGFR interaction in cells, which likely perturbs the ILV sorting of EGFR. On the other hand, higher ubiquitination renders HGS more susceptible to lysosomal degradation. Interestingly, O-GlcNAcylation has been more commonly found to stabilize protein substrates by antagonizing ubiquitination (<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Our finding that O-GlcNAcylation of HGS induces its ubiquitination and promotes HGS degradation is somewhat surprising. Notably, this destabilizing effect of O-GlcNAcylation has also been recently reported in receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), and forkhead box protein A2 (FoxA2) (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).

Uridine-diphospho <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the direct enzymatic substrate for O-GlcNAcylation, is biosynthesized through the metabolism of several major nutrients in cells, including glucose, glutamine, acetyl-CoA, and uridine. The cellular level of O-GlcNAcylation is highly responsive to the oscillation of nutrient concentrations, and thus, O-GlcNAcylation is considered as a nutrient-sensor in cells (<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The occurrence of O-GlcNAcylation on various types of proteins such as transcription factors, metabolic enzymes, and oncogenes suggests a key mechanism to link cellular nutrient sensing to different cell functions. O-GlcNAcylation of HGS functions to inhibit downregulation of cell surface receptors to support a prolonged duration of growth factor signaling. This may represent an important mechanism linking nutrient sensing to cell growth signaling. This study also provides an important insight into the development and progression of diseases with aberrant growth factor signaling, such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s10"><title>Cell Culture and Tumor Tissues.</title><p>Cell lines 293T, SK, Hhu7, and HepG2 were all obtained from ATCC.

Ultrathin layers of two-dimensional (2D) analogs of the three-dimensional (3D) HaPs are particularly attractive for this because of their chemical similarities but higher ambient stability. But do such 2D/3D interfaces actually last, given that ions in HaPs move readily&#x02014;i.e., what happens at those interfaces on the atomic scale? A special electron microscopy, which as a bonus also reveals the true conditions for nondestructive analysis, shows that the large ions that are a necessary part of the 2D films can move into the 3D HaP, a fascinating illustration of <italic toggle="yes">panta rei</italic> in HaPs.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Ultra-thin hydrophobic capping layers of two-dimensional (2D) onto three-dimensional (3D) metal halide perovskites (HaPs) are an attractive strategy for preventing ambient-induced degradation and minimizing interfacial non-idealities of 3D HaPs. However, it is not obvious in how far the unusual 3D HaP lattice dynamics affect 2D-on-3D HaP composites&#x02019; stability, especially at their interface, an issue important for devices made with such composites. Using low electron&#x02013;fluence, four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and nanobeam electron diffraction, we show formation of the 2D (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) phase on top of 3D perovskite, using focused-ion beam-prepared cross-sections, under conditions that minimize radiation damage. The 2D-on-3D HaP composites were prepared by controlled gas-phase surface cation exchange of 3D MAPbI<sub>3</sub> films to form A<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>, where A = (fluoro-)phenyl-ethyl-ammonium, (F)PEA. We provide direct evidence for 2D phase formation also inside the 3D matrix, likely via A cation grain boundary diffusion, and, over time, of quasi-2D phases near the surface. These results show that the 2D/3D heterointerface is dynamic; they imply that not only small, but also large A cations, (F)PEA<sup>+</sup>, migrate. Structural rearrangements, leading to quasi-2D phase formation can be followed with the electron beam, which provides hitherto unknown atomistic insights into such interfaces, needed to assess their (in)stability. Apart from directly illustrating effects of HaP lattice dynamics, our results help understanding extensive (semi)empirical data on engineering 2D-on-3D composites and provide guidance for enhancing stability of such systems. Critically, our direct observation of electron beam-induced loss of long-range periodicity defines conditions for damage-free atomic-resolution studies of HaP samples, also in device-relevant configurations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>halide perovskites</kwd><kwd>2D/3D interface</kwd><kwd>4D-STEM</kwd><kwd>NBED</kwd><kwd>instability</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">Layered perovskites, commonly known as two-dimensional (2D) perovskites because of their multiple 2D quantum confinement structures (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) consisting of alternating sheets of lead halide (PbX<sub>6</sub>)<sup>4-</sup> octahedra (X is a halide) and organic amine layers, have recently attracted renewed attention, as they provide better moisture resistance than their 3D, APbX<sub>3</sub> analogs with small organic amine (or Cs<sup>+</sup>) A<sup>+</sup> cations. The Pb-based 2D Ruddlesden-Popper halide perovskites (HaPs) are generally described by the formula A<sub>2</sub>A&#x02032;<sub>n-1</sub>Pb<sub>n</sub>X<sub>3n+1</sub>, where A&#x02032; are bulky/long organic amine spacer cations, e.g., phenethylammonium (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-), butylammonium (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>-) (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Although efforts have been made to use quasi-2D HaPs (those with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> &#x02265; 2) as the active photoabsorber for photovoltaics, performances have been mostly limited by the poor charge conduction of the organic moieties separating the layers of lead halide octahedra (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Alternatively, 2D HaPs have been used as minor components or ultrathin interfacial layers between bulk 3D perovskite and a hole transporting layer, affecting both (radiative &#x02190;&#x02192; electrical) power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and stabilities of devices (<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The improved efficiency stems from the higher bandgap of the 2D than that of the 3D HaP, which makes the 2D HaP layer not only an effective electron blocking layer but also one that passivates interface defects that act as traps. Such passivation can be explained by the structural and chemical coherence between the HaP structures.</p><p>Despite the clear interest and significant efforts in 2D/3D HaP&#x02013;based device architectures, understanding of the 2D/3D interfaces is limited, and optimization is largely empirical, followed by rationalization. Most studies on 2D/3D interfaces rely on photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Results of these measurements are consistent with diffusion of MA<sup>+</sup> of the 3D HaP across the heterointerface, implying an inherent instability of these interfaces (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Such an interface instability could prove detrimental when ultrathin phase-pure 2D layers are needed to combine performance with stability.</p><p>However, direct information on these interfaces has been lacking. Knowledge of structural arrangements at these 2D/3D interfaces can help understand their instability and therefore aid in controlling it. To this end, high-resolution structural detail information of the 2D/3D interface and its transformations is needed, with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as suitable choice, as it has already been used to capture structural characteristics of the 3D HaPs (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). However, already for 3D HaPs there are discrepancies between the observed electron diffraction patterns (EDPs) and those that are predicted for a perfect perovskite phase (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Often, the reported diffraction pattern of, for example, MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, one of the most TEM-investigated 3D HaPs, does not show (110) diffraction spots, although XRD shows reflections from the corresponding planes. An example is that of (110) reflections, Segawa et&#x000a0;al. reported their absence in EDPs, supposedly because the associated lattice planes are weakly diffracting in organic&#x02013;inorganic HaPs (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). However, it is not clear why that should be the case; it is possible to observe these reflections under measurement conditions suitable to electron beam&#x02013;sensitive samples, i.e., low electron beam fluence and fast acquisition of the EDPs (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Thus, to get atomic-scale structural information on HaPs demands those and additional specialized techniques (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and analyses, rather than the conventional TEM-based approaches that have been developed and used successfully for studying robust inorganic compounds, especially oxides.</p><p>Probing electron beam&#x02013;sensitive materials to investigate interfaces at atomic scales becomes even more challenging if one side of the interface is formed by a 2D (Ruddlesden-Popper) layered HaP, where the lead halide octahedral planes are connected to each other by van der Waals forces. This is probably one reason that TEM studies on 2D HaP structures have been quite limited (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>); to the best of our knowledge, none have yet been reported for a large field of view of 2D/3D heterointerfaces.</p><p>Atomic-scale investigations of these interfaces especially in configurations that are relevant to photovoltaic and light-emitting devices (3D/2D) is, however, difficult, for the following reasons:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>1)</label><p>The atomic-resolution study of those interfaces requires the preparation of thin electron-transparent samples, which increases the possibility of damaging the atomic structure of layers. For instance, a Ga ion beam, as used in a focused ion beam (FIB) microscope to cut lamellae thinner than typically 100 nm, may cause damage by ion implantation and excessive local heating (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><label>2)</label><p>Acquiring structural details of the lattice arrangement at the interfaces requires high electron fluence, typically around 10<sup>3</sup> e<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> for a better than 2-&#x000c5; resolution, while the critical fluence for aliphatic or aromatic organic compounds is about 100&#x000d7; less (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Such a requirement in terms of electron fluence becomes even more demanding for HaPs considering the beam-induced decomposition and subsequent losses of products, causing phase degradations into nonstochiometric HaP and PbI<sub>2</sub> phases (for MAPbI<sub>3</sub> HaP). A critical electron dose &#x02264;&#x0223c;50 e/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> has been reported to capture the pristine perovskite structure of the organic A-cation&#x02013;based HaPs (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Thus, high-resolution studies on 2D/3D HaP interfaces around or below the critical electron fluence could disturb the nature of these interfaces by damaging or altering them. The excess energy that is deposited in the system by the e-beam restricts the possibility of studying the material in its state of interest, i.e., the one it has while being functional, and can also act as intermediary for interface interdiffusion. Both A-site cation and especially halide components of HaPs may be able to diffuse under external stresses such as temperature, illumination, or e-beam irradiation (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These structural rearrangements and reconstructions of and between the 2D and 3D HaPs will affect the stability of 2D/3D structures, and with it the option of using 2D HaPs as passivating buffer layers in 3D devices.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We report first TEM results on the 3D HaP, MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, capped by an ultrathin film of a phenylethylammonium-based 2D lead iodide HaP, focusing on the interface between them. To minimize beam-induced radiation damage during TEM observation, we resorted to 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), employing scanning nanobeam electron diffraction (NBED) over a large field of view with low electron fluence. 4D datasets <italic toggle="yes">I</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">y</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">K<sub>x</sub></italic>, <italic toggle="yes">K<sub>y</sub></italic>) comprising diffraction patterns in reciprocal space (<italic toggle="yes">K<sub>x</sub></italic>, <italic toggle="yes">K<sub>y</sub></italic>) for each probe position (<italic toggle="yes">x</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">y</italic>) on the sample (hence the name 4D) were recorded using the EMPAD (electron microscope pixel array detector) detector (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The simultaneously recorded real-space and momentum-space information allowed us to assess the nanoscale lattice structures and associated changes in diffraction space with simultaneous spatial resolution. Further, we used time series of NBED patterns at a 1-kHz frame rate to follow the decay of diffraction details with high temporal resolution, associated with fast structural changes on a few tens of nanometers scale.</p><p>The results show the inherent structural dynamics at the atomic scale of these 2D/3D perovskites and their interfaces. We find that the instability of layered 2D HaPs on their 3D counterparts is much more pronounced under external degrading stress, e-beam irradiation, in this case. We conclude that for such 2D/3D heterostructures, part of the 2D phase&#x02014;even with a supposedly stabilizing A cation, fluoro-phenyl-ethyl-amine [(F)PEA] (<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>)&#x02014;can diffuse into the 3D lattice, both from the free and grain boundary surfaces. These findings imply that either the 3D HaP engulfs 2D cations or that not only the small but also the large A (PEA, PEA-F) cations migrate, along with the lattice reconstruction induced by such dynamics. Such a process affects the long-term stability of a 2D HaP layer used to passivate and protect the 3D HaP, especially in devices.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><p>Ion/electron beam exposure may substantially promote conditions for migration of A-site organic cations in 2D/3D HaP heterostructures and result in structural reconstruction, thereby complicating the ability to study these structures and their interfaces at an atomic level. Hence, the conditions during the FIB preparation of lamellae for TEM and for the TEM measurements are crucial to preserve the beam-sensitive 2D/3D HaP heterostructures in an undamaged state.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Conditions for FIB Sample Preparation and TEM Measurements.</title><p>Thin TEM lamellae of the 2D/3D HaP on Si substrates were prepared with a Helios 600 Dual Beam FIB-SEM instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We specifically used highly (p-) doped Si (100) as substrates for the TEM studies instead of a more device-relevant one because of a few major considerations, as will be clear from the following results of our initial experiments. The commonly used FTO substrate is relatively rough (&#x0223c;15-nm rms roughness) and a poor thermal conductor, possibly enhancing the beam sensitivity during FIB milling (even under cryo-conditions) because of poor dissipation of heat created by the ion beam. Therefore, we chose Si wafers as mini substrates, which are &#x0223c;15&#x000d7; better thermal conductors [&#x0223c;150 versus &#x0223c;10 W/(m &#x022c5; K)] (<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) than fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and also have a smoother surface (&#x0003c;1-nm rms roughness versus 10- to 15-nm rms roughness) to prepare the beam-sensitive samples for the TEM measurements. An &#x0223c;80-nm protective layer was thermally evaporated using adaptive pulse carbon thread evaporation at an average (very low) sputter deposition rate of 1 nm per pulse onto the samples before FIB processing. This was done to prevent any damage that may occur in the initial phase of FIB preparation, e.g., sample heating, structural deformations, and Ga<sup>+</sup> implantation. We note that the deposition method and quality of the carbon layer is of utmost importance to minimize heating and hence to prevent sample degradation and/or diffusion of any of the layers deposited on the 2D/3D HaP or from the Ga ion beam during the FIB processing. Additional protective layers of carbon (&#x0223c;100 nm) and Pt (&#x0223c;1.5 &#x003bc;m) were then deposited by e- and ion beam&#x02013;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD), respectively, inside the FIB chamber. To carry out the sample lift-out, rough trenches were made by FIB milling with a Ga ion beam of 30 keV accelerating voltage and 2.8 nA beam current. A 1.8- to 2-&#x003bc;m thick lamella was welded to a copper lift-out semigrid with an Omniprobe micromanipulator and was then thinned down to &#x0223c;150 nm thickness at 30 kV by gradually reducing the current to 300 pA, then to 100 pA, and then to 50 pA. The final low-voltage polishing steps to reach a thickness of 60 to 80 nm were done at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and current of 50 pA, followed by a last step at 2 kV and 30 pA current. The polished sample was then transferred to a TEM sample holder and under vacuum to the TEM.</p><p>Then, 4D STEM datasets were obtained in a double aberration&#x02013;corrected Themis-Z microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific Electron Microscopy Solutions) equipped with a high-brightness field emission gun at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. For the 4D STEM measurements, an electron probe with a convergence angle of 0.2 mrad was adjusted and further defocused by typically 5 to 10 &#x003bc;m to increase the real-space probe size to several tens of nanometers in diameter, thus reducing the electron fluence below threshold values for radiation damage. A primary beam current between 1 and 4 pA was used, resulting in a typical value of the fluence of 1 e<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> per beam position. The fluence rate for a single exposure on the EMPAD detector of 1 ms is 1 e<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>/ms at each position in the real-space scan raster. Typically, 4D STEM datasets were acquired over a real-space raster of 128 &#x000d7; 128 pixels, up to 256 &#x000d7; 256 pixels. Thus, the cumulative electron fluence for a typical 500 nm &#x000d7; 500 nm frame, raster scanned with 128 &#x000d7; 128 pixels, is &#x0223c;4 e/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> (detailed calculation appears in the <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2114740119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic></ext-link>), well below the 50 e/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> critical fluence reported to cause beam damage in these samples, as also discussed later (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We use fluence to describe electrons per unit area instead of the more conventionally used electron dose, as the energy deposited by the electrons is dependent on sample parameters such as thickness, while the fluence is a reproducible instrument quantity.</p><p>All measurements were done at room temperature to avoid thermally induced phase transformations. The samples were prepared and stored in a glovebox (&#x0003c;1 to 2 ppm O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O) from where they were removed just before FIB preparation. The samples were thoroughly sealed in an evacuated box in the glovebox before being taken out for TEM sample preparation by FIB processing. The sample was exposed to ambient condition for less than a minute before closing and pumping the C-deposition system. Even though the samples are protected from the ambient after coating with 80-nm carbon, the transfer to the FIB chamber was also done in &#x0003c;1 min. Once the final polishing of the lamella was finished, the samples were transferred to the TEM chamber using an evacuated box. The sample lamella was exposed to ambient for &#x0003c;1 min till pumping of the TEM chamber started. The time between sample preparation and TEM measurements, including FIB preparation, was typically two days, during which period samples/lamella were protected from the ambient, as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s4"><title>Ultrathin 2D HaP via Vapor Phase Surface Cation Exchange of MAPbI<sub>3</sub>.</title><p>The 2D/3D heterointerfaces were formed using vapor phase surface cation exchange of a thin polycrystalline film of a 3D halide perovskite, MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, deposited on a high-doped Si (100) substrate.

Notably, the absence of any other additional peak in the spectrum toward the higher (than 520 nm) wavelength signals the phase purity of the 2D layer formed on 3D MAPbI<sub>3</sub> layers. The information regarding the crystalline nature of these 2D/3D HaP layers was obtained from the XRD data shown in <xref rid="fig01" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 <italic toggle="yes">D</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E</italic></xref>. The MAPbI<sub>3</sub> thin films with surface-grown 2D layers show additional lower angle diffraction peaks associated with the larger unit cell of 2D material, apart from (110), (112), and (220) peaks at 14.1, 20.6, and 28.5 2&#x003b8; values, respectively, characteristic of the tetragonal 3D HaP structure.

PEA and FPEA were chosen as organo-amines instead of the more commonly used n-butylamine (n-BAI), as the 2D HaPs produced with PEA have been reported, from PL and XRD, to form a relatively stable interface with a 3D perovskite (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).

Such an orientation is preferred if ultrathin 2D layers are to protect 3D HaPs from ambient, especially moisture, to improve 3D stability.

Grain boundaries can often serve as diffusion shortcuts, and in polycrystalline HaP films as in this case (and thus also in HaP-based photovoltaic devices with 2D/3D bilayer configuration), they can promote fast in- or interdiffusion of organic amines/ammonium cations. Hence, they can affect 2D or quasi-2D phase distribution in the 3D HaP matrix.

The difference in orientation and the formation of quasi-2D phases near the surface region can be related to how these regions form. The different orientation can be understood from the presence of this 2D patch at a saddle-point intersection between grains, along the boundary between the grains. As such, its formation testifies to the dynamics of interdiffusion that leads to the 2D/3D interfaces at the edges of the patch.</p><p>Based on these results we propose that part of the original 2D perovskite, i.e., the large 2D cations, migrates along grain boundaries into the 3D HaP film; in doing so, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1 2D/3D HaP interfaces reconstruct into <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1 appearing inside the 3D matrix and <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> &#x0003e; 1 2D/3D phases near the surface region. These processes would occur in a polycrystalline 3D HaP films in addition to the in-diffusion of the 2D cations into the 3D matrix through the free surfaces. This implies that such 2D/3D perovskite heterointerface lattice rearrangements involve migration of not only (the smaller) MA<sup>+</sup> but also of the larger FPEA<sup>+</sup> cation into the 3D matrix and, likely faster, along the grain surfaces and boundaries. Indications for such were seen also in experiments with PEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>/MAPbI<sub>3</sub>/FTO samples, in which 2D perovskite domains were also found within the 3D perovskite, including some even near the bottom interface with FTO (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.2114740119/-/DCSupplemental" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:show="new"><italic toggle="yes">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4<italic toggle="yes">D</italic></ext-link>).

The results of these measurements corroborate our TEM findings on the local dynamical processes that occur at the interfaces of 2D-on-3D perovskite layers.

The structural instability of the 2D phase is remarkably more pronounced under e-beam exposure: The higher-order reflections vanish within just 60 to 80 ms of exposure, implying the loss of long-range ordering in the 2D perovskite domains. These structural instabilities due to e-beam exposure could be typical for these (Ruddlesden-Popper) layered structures held together by weak van der Waals interactions. This can be compared to the chemically less labile 3D MAPbI<sub>3</sub> structures, even though their lability under e-beam irradiation is well documented, but under harsher e-beam conditions (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>We found no noticeable change in 3D perovskite reflections even with orders of magnitude higher fluence than what is considered the limit for damage, a feature we ascribe to the very narrow beam used. The apparently surprising sample resilience to electron beam damage is found in the experiment in which we use an e-fluence at a 2 e/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>/ms rate during a few seconds on the sample, i.e., several thousands of e/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, clearly much higher than the critical fluence, 50 e/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, reported in the literature (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). To understand this result, it should be realized that our conditions for 4D STEM NBED data collection are fundamentally different from those for the more usual, selected area diffraction (SAED) pattern mode. In 4D STEM, the beam diameter is at most a few tens of nanometers, which can be compared to several microns for SAED (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Hence, the excess deposited energy in the 4D STEM experiment is very localized and will diffuse readily across and into the sample to the surroundings, leading to much reduced background heating compared to what is the case for SAED. This lower heating strongly reduces any deleterious thermal effects on the sample during and after the measurement. With SAED, the wider e-beam leads to drastic sample degradation already at close to 100&#x000d7; lower total electron fluences (&#x02264;&#x0223c;50 e/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) than the thousands of e/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> that can be tolerated under our 4D STEM NBED experimental conditions (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In addition, the unintentional parasitic coating of the FIB lamella with redeposited carbon may have also helped in reducing the beam damage and increasing the critical fluence, as this coating can serve as a diffusion barrier and reduce the escape probability of the volatile species. Such an effect was demonstrated by Chen et&#x000a0;al. for a carbon-coated MAPbI<sub>3</sub> specimen deposited on a holey carbon copper grid (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>The dynamic structural evolution at these 2D/3D heterointerfaces under the e-beam is further studied by recording the electron diffraction maps under repetitive e-beam scans (with a fluence of &#x0223c;5 e/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> per scan) over a region of the lamella that includes these 2D/3D interfaces. The angular correlation maps for the 2D perovskite (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) phase between the first and third scan are compared in <xref rid="fig07" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">D</italic></xref>. The bright domains in the maps, which show the 2D HaP, effectively disappear as the result of the repetitive e-beam exposures, i.e., after a total electron fluence of &#x0223c;15 e/&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> irradiated on the 2D/3D HaP lamella. The EDPs of these regions of interest are contrasted in <xref rid="fig07" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C</italic> versus <italic toggle="yes">E</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">F</italic></xref>, where <xref rid="fig07" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 <italic toggle="yes">B</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">C</italic></xref> and <xref rid="fig07" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 <italic toggle="yes">E</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">F</italic></xref> show the diffraction patterns from different regions marked in red and yellow ovals of the same sample after the first and third scans, respectively. Notably, reflections that can be attributed to the <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 2 2D phase (labeled in yellow in <xref rid="fig07" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 <italic toggle="yes">E</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">F</italic></xref>) can be discernible along with the 3D MAPbI<sub>3</sub> reflections after the loss of 2D (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1) reflections in the third successive scan. Sequential e-beam scans, while capturing lattice information from each probe position on the lamella, also increase the cumulative electron fluence deposited at those probe positions, possibly mimicking the effect of other external factors on such a HaP system, e.g., temperature. We note that the time constant for a single scan position in our experiments is 1 ms, with frame repetition rates in the order of 1 min; hence, we cannot rule out or confirm for the effects of the temporal processes like sample relaxation and recovery processes (after the electron impact) on the structural response of the 2D/3D HaP interfaces (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, the energy imparted by the e-beam seems to have reconstructed the pristine 2D/3D interfaces into <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = (&#x0003e;)2 2D/3D phases inside the 3D matrix. This suggests that the <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> &#x0003e; 1 2D/3D HaP is more stable against e-beam&#x02013;induced damage than the <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1 2D one.</p><fig position="float" id="fig07" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig. 7.</label><caption><p>Angular correlation maps (<italic toggle="yes">A</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">D</italic>) for the 2D perovskite base period under repetitive e-beam scan of the same region in an FPEA<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>/MAPbI<sub>3</sub>/Si sample.

Under prolonged/repetitive e-beam exposure, the 2D material loses long-range ordering in &#x0003c;100 ms of low-dose e-beam fluence, which provides another limit on use of TEM to study these materials. Having determined the onset of instability, we could then obtain crucial atomic-scale insights into 2D/3D HaPs interface, showcasing the inherent dynamic instability of those we studied. Such an unstable interface can manifest itself in the change of device performance with (short) time, as shown recently with improved PCEs after suggested formation of quasi-2D material at the interface (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It remains to be seen if such a phenomenon can cause additional, possibly negative effects in the long run.</p><p>The spatial migration of the large 2D-forming cations into the 3D HaP matrix from and via the free surfaces, and likely faster along grain boundaries, and the appearance of 2D phases with <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> &#x0003e; 1 around a grain boundary near the surface region and over time imply that both the smaller MA<sup>+</sup> and the longer F-PEA<sup>+</sup> cations can migrate, leading to lattice rearrangements. Understanding such instabilities will be critical for avoiding (inter)diffusion of A-site cations in lead iodide&#x02013;based HaPs and the structural consequences of such diffusions. Apart from the above-mentioned long-term stability issue, our results pose a challenge in understanding the structural and energetic aspects of diffusion of the relatively large F-PEA<sup>+</sup> cation into and through the 3D HaP matrix. Most importantly, at least for the direction of research that stimulated this study, our results point to the need for more sophisticated design of 2D HaPs if they are to be used as protective barriers for 3D HaP&#x02013;based photovoltaic devices.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2114740119.sapp.pdf" id="d64e1270" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2114740119.sm01.mp4" id="d64e1273" position="anchor" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2114740119.sm02.mp4" id="d64e1276" position="anchor" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><label>Supplementary File</label><media xlink:href="pnas.2114740119.sm03.mp4" id="d64e1279" position="anchor" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>S.K. held an Israel Council of Higher Learning for a Planning and Budgeting Committee Postdoctoral Fellowship at Bar-Ilan University.

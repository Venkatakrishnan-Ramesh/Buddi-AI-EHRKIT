Performance on sustained attention paradigms such as continuous performance tasks are influenced by both the ability to sustain attention and response strategy. However, previous studies have not dissociated PTSD-related associations with sustained attention ability and strategy, which limits characterization of neural circuitry underlying PTSD-related attentional impairments. Therefore, we characterized and replicated PTSD-related associations with sustained attention ability and response strategy in trauma-exposed Veterans, which guided characterization of PTSD-related differences in neural circuit function. In Study 1, PTSD symptoms were selectively associated with reduced sustained attention ability, but not more impulsive response strategies. In Study 2, we utilized task and resting-state fMRI to characterize neural circuitry underlying PTSD-related differences in sustained attention ability. Both PTSD symptomatology and sustained attention ability exhibited converging associations with reduced dorsal attention network (DAN) synchronization to endogeneous attentional fluctuations. Post-hoc time course analyses demonstrated that PTSD symptoms were most accurately characterized by delayed, rather than globally reduced, DAN synchronization to endogenous attentional fluctuations. Together, these findings suggest that PTSD symptomatology may selectively impair sustained attention ability by disrupting proactive engagement of attentional control circuitry.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>PTSD</kwd><kwd>Sustained attention</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>Neural networks</kwd><kwd>Cognition</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>General introduction</title><p id="p0030">Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops in approximately 14% of post-9/11 Veterans who served in Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and/or New Dawn (<xref rid="b0340" ref-type="bibr">Tanielian, Tanielian, &#x00026; Jaycox, 2008</xref>). Broadly defined, PTSD is characterized by symptom clusters including reexperiencing (e.g., trauma-related flashbacks), avoidance (e.g., avoiding trauma-related cues), negative cognitions and mood (e.g., anhedonia), and hyperarousal symptoms (e.g., difficulty concentrating; American Psychiatric <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Association, 2013</xref>). In addition to trauma-related perturbations, a growing body of literature demonstrates that PTSD symptomatology is also associated with more global impairments in sustained attention (for reviews, see <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Aupperle et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). Although it remains unclear if sustained attention deficits reflect a PTSD risk factor, sequela, or both (<xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Samuelson et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">Vasterling et al., 1998</xref>), impaired sustained attention produces significant functional impairments and may extend PTSD chronicity (<xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Catarino et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Aupperle et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Jagger-Rickels et al., 2022</xref>). For example, disrupted cognitive functioning in PTSD is associated with difficulties maintaining employment (<xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Smith, Schnurr, &#x00026; Rosenheck, 2005</xref>). To better understand PTSD-related attentional dysfunction, however, an important first step is to more precisely characterize PTSD-related associations with sustained attention and supporting neural circuitry.</p><p id="p0035">Sustained attention is a core cognitive function that maintains information processing across time, which exhibits moment-to-moment fluctuations depending on factors such as arousal and/or motivation (<xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">Shenhav et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Sarter et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Esterman and Rothlein, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Fortenbaugh et al., 2017b</xref>). To measure sustained attention dynamics, experimental research often utilizes continuous performance tasks (CPTs) that continuously present stimuli that require either initiation of responses (&#x0201c;go&#x0201d; trials) or inhibition of responses (&#x0201c;no-go" trials; for a review, see <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Langner &#x00026; Eickhoff, 2013</xref>). Consistent with signal detection theory (<xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Marcum, 1960</xref>), performance on CPT paradigms can be decomposed into measures that primarily reflect the <italic>ability</italic> to sustain attention or the response <italic>strategy</italic> used to maintain task performance (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Fortenbaugh et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Riley et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Esterman et al., 2014a</xref>). However, it remains unclear if PTSD symptomatology is associated with impaired ability to sustain attention, sub-optimal response strategies, or both factors in CPT paradigms.</p><p id="p0040">Regarding sustained attention <italic>ability</italic>, PTSD symptoms have been associated with reductions in both the accuracy and stability of task performance. For example, some studies demonstrate that PTSD symptoms are associated with weaker response inhibition as measured by more frequent errors on &#x0201c;no-go&#x0201d; trials, whereas other studies demonstrate PTSD symptoms are associated with weaker response initiation as measured by more frequent errors on &#x0201c;go&#x0201d; trials (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">DeGutis et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">Swick et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">Swick et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">Swick et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">Swick and Ashley, 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Quinones et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">Vasterling et al., 2002</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Although seemingly contradictory, these findings suggest that PTSD symptomatology may be most accurately characterized by an impaired ability to dynamically switch <italic>between</italic> response initiation and response inhibition (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Aupperle et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Dutra et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, the ability to switch between response inhibition and response initiation varies as a function of attention stability. Specifically, reaction time (RT) variability is used to index stable attention states that are more resilient to disruption (lower RT variability) and unstable attention states that are more susceptible to disruption (higher RT variability; <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Jun and Lee, 2021</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Esterman et al., 2014b</xref>, <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Esterman et al., 2013</xref>). Previous research demonstrates that PTSD symptoms are associated with greater RT variability, which indicates less stable sustained attention (<xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">Swick et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">Swick and Ashley, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Alon et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Esterman et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that PTSD symptomatology is associated with a reduced ability to maintain accurate (lower d-prime) and stable (greater RT variability) task performance on CPT paradigms.</p><p id="p0045">Additionally, PTSD symptomatology may be characterized by more impulsive response <italic>strategies</italic> during CPT paradigms. Broadly, response strategies reflect a trade-off between prioritizing response inhibition (more cautious) or prioritizing response initiation (more impulsive; see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). For example, PTSD symptoms are associated with a more impulsive response criterion threshold (i.e., prioritized response initiation), but this association may depend on whether task stimuli are affective or non-affective (<xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Amick et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Fortenbaugh et al., 2017a</xref>). Also consistent with a more impulsive response strategy, PTSD symptoms are associated with generally faster responses during CPT paradigms (<xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">Swick and Ashley, 2020</xref>), which decreases response initiation failures at the cost of increasing response inhibition failures (<xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Fortenbaugh et al., 2015</xref>). Although inconsistent across studies, some research suggests that PTSD symptoms are also associated with less post-error slowing (PES) immediately following errors (<xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Clemans et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">Swick et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Evans et al., 2021</xref>), which may increase the probability of subsequent errors (for a review, see <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Danielmeier &#x00026; Ullsperger, 2011</xref>). To summarize, PTSD symptoms may be associated with more impulsive <italic>strategies</italic> when completing CPT paradigms, which aligns with elevated impulsivity associated with PTSD more generally (American Psychiatric <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Association, 2013</xref>).<fig id="f0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Gradual Onset Continuous Performance Task (gradCPT) and Sustained Attention Measures. <italic>Legend:</italic> In the gradCPT, participants are instructed to respond to city scenes, but withhold responses to mountain scenes. For city scenes, participants may either correctly initiate a response (correct commission; CC) or incorrectly fail to initiate a response (omission error; OE). For mountain scenes, participants may either correctly inhibit a response (correct omission; CO) or incorrectly initiate a response (commission error; CE). A) To measure overall task accuracy, d-prime is computed as the relative normal inverse cumulative distribution function of &#x0201c;hits&#x0201d; (COs) and &#x0201c;false alarms&#x0201d; (OEs).

Specifically, no research has conjointly characterized PTSD-related associations with sustained attention ability and strategy <italic>within</italic> the same study. Due to marked cross-study differences in sample characteristics and CPT parameters, it is also not possible to directly compare PTSD-related associations with sustained attention ability and strategy <italic>between</italic> studies. Regarding sample characteristics, previous research has demonstrated that PTSD-related associations with sustained attention measures may systematically vary as a function of comorbid anxiety and/or depressive symptoms as well as the co-occurrence of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs; <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Esterman et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">Swick et al., 2012</xref>). Regarding CPT parameters, PTSD-related associations may vary depending on task duration given that sustained attention is increasingly taxed over time (<xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">Shenhav et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Esterman and Rothlein, 2019</xref>) and/or differing response probabilities that titrate demands on inhibitory control (<xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Jun, Remington, Koutstaal, &#x00026; Jiang, 2019</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear if PTSD symptoms are associated with impaired sustained attention ability, more impulsive strategies, or both factors.</p><p id="p0055">Failure to dissociate PTSD-related associations with sustained attention and strategy also has direct bearing on investigating the neural correlates of PTSD-related attentional dysfunction. Neuroimaging research suggests that sustained attention ability and response strategy may be supported by distinct neurocognitive systems. For example, measures of sustained attention ability such as d-prime and RT variability are associated with the dynamic engagement of large-scale cortical networks such as the dorsal attention network (DAN) and default mode network (DMN) to stabilize attentional states (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Fortenbaugh et al., 2018</xref>, <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Kucyi et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, response strategies are instead predominantly supported by Salience Network (SN) nodes such as the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula (<xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">Yamashita et al., 2021a</xref>, <xref rid="b0380" ref-type="bibr">Yamashita et al., 2021c</xref>, <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Ham et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, dissociating PTSD-related associations with sustained attention ability and response strategy is an important first step prior to characterizing the neural correlates of such PTSD-related differences.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Objectives of the current studies</title><p id="p0060">To address these issues, we conducted two behavioral experiments and one neuroimaging experiment. First, we characterized PTSD-related associations with signal detection-based measures that dissociate sustained attention ability and strategy using same sustained attention paradigm within a large sample of trauma-exposed veterans (Study 1: Discovery Sample). Second, we aimed to directly replicate this pattern of PTSD-related associations in an independent sample of trauma-exposed veterans (Study 1: Replication Sample). In Study 2, we aimed to replicate and extend these behavioral results by using functional magnetic response imaging (fMRI) to characterize the neural correlates of PTSD-related associations with the attention factor(s) identified in Study 1.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>3</label><title>Study 1</title><p id="p0065">To dissociate PTSD-related associations with sustained attention ability and response strategy, we administered a well-validated gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT) to two large samples of post-9/11 veterans (see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Esterman et al., 2013</xref>). Given mixed patterns of PTSD-related associations observed across prior studies, we did not make <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses regarding selective PTSD-related associations with sustained attention ability or strategy. Instead, we conducted Study 1 to initially characterize PTSD-related associations among these measures in a data-driven manner (Discovery Sample). Next, we attempted to directly replicate these PTSD-related associations in an independent sample of post-9/11 Veterans (Replication Sample). Supporting this two-step approach, the Discovery and Replication samples did not differ in PTSD severity or sustained attention measures (see <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and Results).

In TRACTS, Veterans report a heterogeneous array of traumatic experiences (e.g., combat exposure, sexual assault, etc.), which includes both service-related and service-unrelated traumas. Veterans were sequentially recruited from the larger TRACTS program in Boston (VABHS; Discovery Sample) or Houston (VAHHC; Replication Sample).

In a larger sample combining both the Discovery and Replication samples, PTSD symptoms were also modestly associated with greater RT variability. Together, these findings suggest that PTSD symptoms were associated with a reduced ability to maintain accurate (lower d-prime) and stable (greater RT variability) task performance. In both the independent and combined samples, PTSD symptoms were not reliably associated with a more impulsive response strategy as measured by mean RT, criterion, or PES. Although this pattern of results suggest that PTSD symptomatology is selectively associated with impaired ability to sustain attention, it is important to note that PTSD-related associations exhibited small effect sizes, which is consistent with previous studies (for a review, see <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Aupperle et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0210">Taken together, our results demonstrate that PTSD symptomatology was selectively associated with impaired sustained attention ability, but not utilization of more impulsive response strategies. However, there are several potential mechanisms that may contribute to PTSD-related associations with impaired sustained attention ability, which cannot be easily disentangled with behavioral measures. For example, PTSD symptomatology may be associated with dysregulation of neural systems that support more effortful attentional control processes and/or more automatic attentional control processes specifically during active demands on sustained attention. Alternatively, PTSD symptomatology may be associated with more global dysregulation of neural systems that is not necessarily specific to sustained attention demands, but subsequently contributes to impaired sustained attention ability. To disentangle these possibilities, Study 2 utilized an 8-minute version of the gradCPT in conjunction with functional magnetic response imaging (fMRI) alongside a passive resting state condition.</p></sec><sec id="s0150"><label>7</label><title>Study 2</title><p id="p0215">Previous research demonstrates that individual differences in sustained attention ability are associated with the strength of synchronization between neural network activity and attentional fluctuations (brain-behavior synchronization; <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Esterman and Rothlein, 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Kucyi et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Fortenbaugh et al., 2018</xref>).

First, trials without RTs (COs and OEs) are linearly interpolated using surrounding trial RTs to create a continuous timeseries.

Fourth, the deviation score timeseries is z-transformed, which produces a normalized VTC that is standardized across participants. Thus, the VTC indexes dynamic fluctuations in sustained attention that are orthogonal to both overall RT and the overall magnitude of RT variability.

Demonstrating a functional relationship, reduced positive DAN synchronization was also associated with impaired sustained attention ability (lower d-prime and greater CV).

Given that similar results were observed after applying bandpass filtering or global signal regression, however, it is unlikely that a failure to observe PTSD-related associations can be attributed to differences in pre-processing. Instead, the lack of PTSD-related associations with functional connectivity estimates is consistent with the heterogeneous pattern of PTSD-related differences observed across studies. For example, studies variably demonstrate that PTSD symptoms are associated with <italic>hyper</italic>connectivity, <italic>hypo</italic>connectivity, or no differences in connectivity within the SN (<xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Koch et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Neria, 2021</xref>). Thus, it is possible that PTSD-related differences in functional connectivity vary widely as a function of sample characteristics (e.g., type of trauma exposure), neurobiological factors (e.g., executive dysfunction), or more complex interactions among specific PTSD symptom clusters (<xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Etkin et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Esterman et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">Sheynin et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Jagger-Rickels et al., 2021</xref>, <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">Tursich et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0260"><label>12</label><title>General discussion</title><p id="p0375">Across three independent samples of post-9/11 Veterans, we observed and replicated that PTSD symptoms were selectively associated with impaired sustained attention ability (d-prime and CV), but not response strategy (RT, criterion, and PES). In Study 2, PTSD symptoms were associated with delayed synchronization between DAN activity and attentional fluctuations measured during the gradCPT paradigm. Consistent with previous PTSD research (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Aupperle et al., 2012</xref>), however, PTSD-related deficits in both sustained attention ability and DAN synchronization were relatively small in magnitude. Nevertheless, these results collectively suggest that PTSD symptomatology may impair sustained attention ability by reducing dynamic recruitment of attentional control processes.</p><p id="p0380">At the behavioral level, PTSD symptoms were selectively associated with reduced sustained attention ability, but not more impulsive response strategies. To date, this issue was not previously addressable due to marked cross-study differences in sample and/or task characteristics. By using the same gradCPT paradigm to measure both sustained attention ability and strategy, however, we were able to more directly dissociate PTSD-related associations among these sustained attention factors. Using this approach, we demonstrated that PTSD symptoms were selectively associated with lower d-prime and greater RT variability, which suggests impairments in sustained attention ability. In contrast, PTSD symptoms were not associated with mean RT, criterion, or PES, which is inconsistent with a more impulsive response strategy. Thus, PTSD symptomatology is primarily characterized by impairments in the ability to maintain accurate (d-prime) and stable (RT variability) attentional states.</p><p id="p0385">At the neural level, we proposed two sets of alternative hypotheses regarding the neural correlates of PTSD-related impairments in sustained attention ability. Based on previous studies using the gradCPT paradigm, we primarily proposed that PTSD symptoms may impair sustained attention ability via reduced synchronization between attentional fluctuations and neural network activity. In short, these hypotheses predicted that PTSD symptomatology would be associated with reduced task-related synchronization of the DAN and/or DMN with endogenous attentional fluctuations. Alternatively, a recently proposed triple-network model proposes that PTSD symptomology may exert a more global influence on functional connectivity within and between the SN, FPCN, and DMN, which occurs independent of sustained attention demands (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Akiki et al., 2017</xref>). Based on this triple-network model, we alternatively considered that PTSD symptoms may be associated with more global disruption of network functional connectivity during both active task demands and passive resting state conditions.</p><p id="p0390">Among these putative neurobiological mechanisms, our results are most consistent with selective PTSD-related deficits in synchronization between DAN activity and endogenous attentional fluctuations, rather than more global deficits in functional connectivity. Specifically, PTSD symptoms were associated with weaker dynamic increases in DAN activation as a function of less stable attention states. Demonstrating functional relevance to sustained attention ability, reduced DAN synchronization was also associated with lower d-prime and higher CV. As such, PTSD symptomatology may impair the proactive recruitment of top-down attentional control processes as attentional states become unstable. Consistent with this interpretation, time course analyses demonstrated that PTSD symptoms were most accurately characterized by <italic>delayed</italic> synchronization between DAN activation and attentional fluctuations, rather than more global reductions in task-related DAN synchronization. Specifically, PTSD symptoms were associated with weaker DAN synchronization both prior and in response to attentional fluctuations, but PTSD symptoms were not associated with weaker DAN synchronization following attentional fluctuations. Within this time course, however, it is important to note that DAN activity was no longer synchronized with attentional fluctuations during the final two time points using a 10&#x000a0;s lag or 12&#x000a0;s lag. Based on this result, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that the lack of PTSD-related differences at these final two time points reflects a more general decline in DAN synchronization that precludes detection of any PTSD-related associations. Taken together, however, this converging pattern of results suggests that DAN synchronization may play a mechanistic role in the relationship between PTSD symptomatology and reduced sustained attention ability.</p><p id="p0395">From a mechanistic perspective, the relationship between PTSD symptomatology and DAN synchronization dovetails with the DAN&#x02019;s functional role in supporting proactive attentional control (<xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Rajan et al., 2021</xref>). Core nodes of the DAN such as the frontal eye fields (FEF) are retinotopically organized to facilitate top-down control over visual information processing (<xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">Vossel, Geng, &#x00026; Fink, 2014</xref>). More specifically, the DAN instantiates top-down attentional control by causally biasing the visual system to preferentially process certain stimulus features (e.g., size, orientation, color, etc.) that are most relevant for behavioral response selection (<xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Morishima et al., 2009</xref>). In the gradCPT, behavioral response selection (initiate vs. inhibit) is guided by visual features that effectively differentiate between city scenes (e.g., straight edges) and mountain scenes (e.g., curved edges), which are dynamically blended between trials. Given these dynamic visual inputs, it is necessary to proactively engage attentional control processes both prior to and in response to endogenous fluctuations in attention that may interfere with visual feature discrimination. Thus, PTSD-related reductions in DAN synchronization may disrupt sustained attention ability by delaying proactive engagement of attentional control resources that stabilize visual feature discrimination across endogenous attention states.</p><p id="p0400">When interpreting these findings, it is important to consider that impaired sustained attention is not specific to PTSD, but instead characterizes a diverse range of distinct psychiatric disorders (<xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Fortenbaugh et al., 2017b</xref>). Based on neuropsychological measures more broadly, attention is disrupted in disorders ranging from anxiety and mood disorders to psychotic spectrum disorders (for a review, see <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Abramovitch, Short, &#x00026; Schweiger, 2021</xref>). Based on task-based fMRI more specifically, previous work suggests that individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) also exhibit impaired sustained attention ability and task-related DAN dysfunction (<xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Keller et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">Yamashita et al., 2021a</xref>). Moreover, PTSD is frequently comorbid with MDD and ADHD, which are each similarly characterized by attention impairments (<xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Kessler et al., 1995</xref>, <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Harrington et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Hankin et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Nichter et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Richardson et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this pattern of comorbidity, over 50% of TRACTS Veterans exhibit three or more comorbid psychiatric conditions (<xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">McGlinchey et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that reduced DAN synchronization with endogenous attentional fluctuations reflects a PTSD-specific neural correlate of impaired sustained attention. Instead, it is possible that reduced DAN synchronization impairs sustained attention transdiagnostically. Future research will be needed to determine if PTSD and other psychiatric disorders similarly or distinctly modulate brain-behavior synchronization during sustained attention demands.</p><p id="p0405">Beyond these considerations, it is important to note several limitations of the current study. First, the current study did not include a healthy control group that was not trauma-exposed. Given the lack of a healthy control group, we cannot rule out the possibility that behavioral and neural patterns observed at lower levels of PTSD symptoms reflect a resilience to trauma exposure, rather than normative functioning. Therefore, it will be necessary for future work to directly compare individuals with PTSD, trauma-exposed individuals without PTSD, and individuals without any history of trauma exposure. Second, veteran samples are not demographically representative of the larger population of trauma-exposed adults in the United States (<xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Lippa et al., 2015</xref>). Although we replicated our results in a more racially diverse sample of Veterans, it will nevertheless be important for future studies to attempt to replicate these findings in more nationally representative samples of adults with PTSD. Third, we did not collect measures of physiological reactivity during fMRI scanning such as heart rate or respiration in Study 2, which exert an influence on BOLD signal variability and functional connectivity during resting-state (<xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Murphy, Birn, &#x00026; Bandettini, 2013</xref>). Although we observed similar results after using bandpass filtering to exclude variability in higher frequency bands commonly associated with cardiac and respiratory periodicity, we cannot rule out the possibility that individual differences in physiological reactivity may contribute to PTSD-related differences in functional brain activitity. Finally, we did not employ a strict multiple comparison correction for our neural analyses given our <italic>a priori</italic> hypotheses regarding the role of brain-behavior synchronization in sustained attention ability. Thus, our neural results should be interpreted more cautiously prior to replication in an independent sample.</p><p id="p0410">Despite these limitations, we believe the current studies offer potential mechanistic insights into PTSD-related impairments in sustained attention. At the behavioral level, we demonstrated that PTSD symptomatology is selectively associated with sustained attention ability, but not more impulsive response strategies. At the neural systems level, PTSD symptomology was associated with reduced and delayed synchronization between DAN activation and attentional fluctuations, which may disrupt proactive recruitment of attentional control. Collectively, these results provide a more mechanistic characterization of the relationship between PTSD symptomatology and sustained attention, which may be useful towards the development of neuroscience-informed treatments that remediate attention dysfunction in PTSD.</p></sec><sec id="s8000"><title>Funding</title><p id="p8005">This research was supported by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs through the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders, a VA Rehabilitation Research and Development Traumatic Brain Injury National Research Center (B9254-CAQ18 and B3001-C) to R.M., a Merit Review Award from the VA Clinical Sciences Research and Development Service (I01CX001653) to M.E, T32 post-doctoral training award from the National Institute of Health (2T32MH01983621) to A.J.R., and an Office of Academic Affairs fellowship to T.E.</p></sec><sec id="s0265"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0415"><bold>Travis C.

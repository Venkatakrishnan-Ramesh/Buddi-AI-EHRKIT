Poor oral health and impaired oral function negatively affect the health and quality of life of older adults. Developing care systems that aim to meet patients&#x02019; normative needs as well as their perceived needs and expectations is one factor in successful delivery of appropriate dental care. Cost is another significant driver of utilisation, and many older adults worldwide lack adequate resources for dental care. Failure to address these issues results in poor outcomes and increased costs of dental and medical care. Disease prevention and control at early stages can preserve public and private financial resources as well as quality of life and well-being for older adults at any stage of life.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0001"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Older adults</kwd><kwd>Oral systemic connection</kwd><kwd>Frailty</kwd><kwd>Expenditures</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Policy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0001"><title>Introduction</title><p id="para0002">Oral health is a critical but neglected component of healthy ageing.<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The FDI World Dental Federation defines oral health as &#x0201c;multi-faceted and includes the ability to speak, smile, smell, taste, touch, chew, swallow and convey a range of emotions through facial expressions with confidence and without pain, discomfort and disease of the craniofacial complex (head, face, and oral cavity).&#x0201d;<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Oral problems such as missing teeth, dental decay, mobile teeth, denture problems, oral lesions, and xerostomia may cause pain and discomfort; impair chewing, speaking, swallowing, smiling, and communicating; and diminish quality of life.

And just as provider and patient points of view may differ chairside, they may also differ around the kind of research and policies that are needed to improve experiences and outcomes of care. Therefore, older adults themselves should be active participants when policy and resources for oral health care are established. Information about the oral-systemic connection, the oral health needs and demands of older adults, and the costs and neglect of care should be shared broadly as policy is set. There is also evidence for increased expenditures associated with tooth loss and medical management as a result of acute dental disease that arises from neglect of oral health. Unmet oral health needs in older adults are a problem worldwide, and models and policies that have effectively moved the needle forward to maintain or improve oral health as an element of healthy ageing should be sought out and shared. Whilst each country will have unique challenges and opportunities, sharing lessons learned and strategies to reduce disparities to improve outcomes of care and integrate oral health care in health care systems will be required to reap the benefits of good oral health on total health and well-being over a lifetime. This literature review examines the need for countries to develop appropriate policies that support individualised, cost-effective, sustainable care that is appropriate to meet the unique oral health needs of older adults.</p><sec id="sec0002"><title>The oral systemic connection in older adults</title><p id="para0005">There is increasing evidence of an association between oral and general health in older people, mediated through common risk factors including nutrition, systemic inflammation, infection, and psychosocial factors, but causal links are still under investigation.<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A confirmed bidirectional association exists between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus.

Despite inherent limitations in data sources, they estimated that in 2015 $356.80 billion US dollars was spent on direct dental treatment worldwide and $187.61 billion was consumed by losses in productivity due to oral diseases, totaling $544.41 billion expended for oral health care. They determined expenditures on oral health care to account for 4.6% of total expenditures on health globally.

This programme aims not only to prevent decline in oral health and function but also to prevent frailty and reduce dependence on long-term care.</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0006"><label>(6)</label><p id="para0049">Prevention and control of metabolic syndrome: A national system of specific health checkups and health guidance for the prevention of metabolic syndrome, which targets people older than 40 years, was implemented in April 2008. As part of this system, health education materials designed to prevent metabolic syndrome (diabetes, obesity, and heart disease), as well as related risk factors such as periodontal disease and chewing function decline, have been developed. This national system of specific health checkups and specific health guidance is reviewed and updated once every 5 years. In 2018, question items regarding subjective chewing function were added because a decline in chewing function is indicative of dental disease and tooth loss.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="para0050">The rapidly accumulating evidence showing the links between oral health and general health signals the need for a completely new framework of medical and dental collaboration on practice and policy. The policies outlined above represent a clear and growing trend towards positioning dental and oral health as an essential element in all relevant areas of Japan's health policy, including NCDs and frailty prevention. This trend represents a significant step towards translating evidence into practice, and it calls for a large-scale shift towards multisectorial and interprofessional cooperation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0012"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="para0051">Poor oral health has been shown to have strong associations with other noncommunicable chronic diseases such as diabetes, respiratory diseases, and dementia, which in turn can increase the risk of oral disease and increase the need for oral health care. Poor oral health and impaired oral function negatively affect older patients&#x02019; quality of life and can exacerbate systemic decline in frail older adults. Improved access and appropriate resources for preventive and restorative care are needed for well to frail older adults so that more complex curative or restorative care is not needed when individuals are most frail. Delivering appropriate dental care also necessitates incorporating the patients&#x02019; perspectives on what aspects of oral health are important to them and developing care systems that meet perceived, expressed, and normative needs.</p><p id="para0052">Numerous studies have reported better health outcomes and reduced costs of medical care when regular, preventive oral health care is provided as a fundamental part of health care. Management of unmet dental needs in emergency and acute care medical settings has also been shown to be a significant driver of cost in countries where older adults lack resources for routine dental care. Policies and strategies that support oral health literacy, integration of oral health care with medical care, availability of resources to address inequities in access to care, and appropriate expenditures with improved utilisation are needed worldwide. Oral disease prevention and treatment at early stages of oral disease can support systemic health, preserve private and public resources, and maintain quality of life and well-being for older adults at every stage of life.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="para0054">None disclosed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="bib0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0001"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>World Health Organization</collab></person-group><part-title>World report on ageing and health</part-title><year>2015</year><publisher-name>WHO Press</publisher-name><publisher-loc>Geneva, Switzerland</publisher-loc></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="sbref0002">FDI World Dental Federation, Oral Health for an Ageing Population: Roadmap for Healthy Aging, 2018.

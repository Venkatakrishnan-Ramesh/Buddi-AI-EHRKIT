We model these prenatal risk factors in mice by co-exposing pregnant dams to an environmental pollutant and limited-resource stress, which robustly activates the maternal immune system. Only male offspring display long-lasting behavioral abnormalities and alterations in the activity of brain networks encoding social interactions. Cellularly, prenatal stressors diminish microglial function within the anterior cingulate cortex, a central node of the social coding network, in males during early postnatal development. Precise inhibition of microglial phagocytosis within the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of wild-type (WT) mice during the same critical period mimics the impact of prenatal stressors on a male-specific behavior, indicating that environmental stressors alter neural circuit formation in males via impairing microglia function during development.</p></abstract><abstract id="ABS2" abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="P4">

Furthermore, sex is a significant risk factor for these disorders, with a strong male bias (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Hanamsagar and Bilbo, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Air pollutant exposure during pregnancy or the first year of life is one of the most consistent environmental risk factors for NDDs (<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">Oudin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R72" ref-type="bibr">Rafenberg and Annesi-Maesano, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">Raz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">Rossignol et al., 2014</xref>). However, the associations of single environmental agents with NDDs have been relatively weak, and thus causality has been difficult to determine. Non-chemical stressors such as limited resources or social support of the mother can increase the vulnerability of the fetus to toxic exposures, which could explain why certain populations are disproportionately affected (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Larson, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R74" ref-type="bibr">Rice et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, neighborhood quality is a significant modifier of air pollution risk (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">McGuinn et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that environmental and social stressors synergize to increase vulnerability to pollutant exposure, but how these exposures alter fetal brain development and affect offspring behavior is largely unknown.</p><p id="P8">Inflammatory events during pregnancy, such as maternal infection with bacteria or viruses, lead to maternal immune activation (MIA), which is linked to NDDs in offspring (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Callaghan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">Rudolph et al., 2018</xref>). Recent transcriptome-wide studies in postmortem brains of individuals diagnosed with an NDD have identified expression modules with enrichment of genes involved in neuroinflammatory function, with a particular dysregulation of microglial genes (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Gandal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Gilman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">Quesnel-Vallieres et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">Velmeshev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R97" ref-type="bibr">Voineagu et al., 2011</xref>). Microglia are the primary immunocompetent cells of the brain and are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations of homeostasis and thus may be poised to act as immediate responders to environmental insults. Microglia are also essential regulators of activity-dependent synaptic remodeling during development (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Kopec et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">Schafer and Stevens, 2013</xref>), in which they prune inappropriate/weak synapses while sparing appropriate/strong connections. Importantly, transcriptome studies have found that immune changes co-occur with gene enrichment modules affecting synaptic function, suggesting the possibility that neuroimmune changes during development could lead to aberrant synapse development by altering microglial function.</p><p id="P9">A recent analysis found that MIA was more common in male children with ASD than female children, suggesting that a sex difference in response to maternal inflammation may be one mechanism that underlies increased male vulnerability (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, we and others have found sex differences in microglial development, maturation, and function, including an increased relative expression of microglial genes in male brains, compared with females. Interestingly, the microglial genes enriched in male brains are also implicated in ASD (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Hanamsagar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R103" ref-type="bibr">Werling et al., 2016</xref>). Together these data point to a mechanism by which sexually dimorphic microglial responses to prenatal stressors could lead to aberrant brain development, primarily in males.</p><p id="P10">Here, we demonstrate that a combination of air pollution and maternal stress exposures during pregnancy activate the maternal immune system of mouse dams leading to altered synaptic and microglial development, persistent changes in brain circuit function, and long-lasting alterations in social and communication behavior in male offspring.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Prenatal exposure to air pollution and maternal stress induces MIA</title><p id="P11">To model a combination of chemical and social stressor exposures in mice, we exposed pregnant dams to intermittent diesel exhaust particle (DEP) instillations to mimic chronic air pollution. DEP is a primary toxic component of air pollution and a potent neuroinflammatory stimulus (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Jayaraj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Levesque et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Then, we applied a maternal stressor of resource deprivation during the last trimester of pregnancy by limiting the bedding and nesting material (i.e., DEP + MS condition) (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bolton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">Rice et al., 2008</xref>). Control dams received instillations of the vehicle solution (i.e., 0.05% Tween20 in PBS) and were housed in standard cages with full nesting material (CON). We measured segmented filamentous bacteria in fecal and cecal samples and found no evidence of it in our colony (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>).</p><p id="P12">The combined environmental stressors, hereafter called DEP + MS, did not alter weight gain during pregnancy or litter size <italic toggle="yes">in utero</italic> (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). To confirm the effects of maternal stress on dams, we measured the concentration of stress hormone, corticosterone (CORT), in serum from dams at embryonic day (E)17.5 and found an increase in DEP + MS dams compared with CON dams (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, left). Importantly, CORT levels of CON dams were similar to baseline CORT levels of untreated pregnant dams (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, right), indicating that our instillation method alone is not sufficient to induce significant stress in pregnant dams.</p><p id="P13">Chronic exposure to air pollution can impact lung function via inflammation or changes in cellular immunity. To examine inflammatory changes in the lung, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from dams in each condition at E17.5 and performed histology on BALF cells. We found no significant group differences in the number of cells collected from BALF (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1A</xref>) and no significant differences in the density of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C</xref>). When we examined macrophages from BALF in DEP + MS dams, we found that these cells are highly congested with particulates, in some cases filling more than 90% of the cell (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Next, to examine the possibility that maternal exposures induce a systemic immune response in the dams, we analyzed a curated panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines linked to adverse outcomes in offspring. DEP + MS dams have significant increases in several proinflammatory cytokines in serum at E17.5, namely interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;), and IL-12/IL-23p40 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1J</xref>). We found no significant differences in interferon gamma (IFN-&#x00263;), IL-5, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), or IL-10 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S1D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1G</xref>). One of the other widely-adopted models of MIA, the maternal viral infection model (poly I:C), also acutely increases IL-6, IL-17A, and TNF-&#x003b1; in dams (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Hsiao and Patterson, 2011</xref>), demonstrating that diverse environmental factors converge onto similar pathways. Taken together, these results show that DEP + MS leads to robust systemic immune activation in pregnant dams.</p><p id="P15">Given the broad expression of cytokine changes we observe in our model, we tested the role of the pattern recognition receptor, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is upstream of many proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, DEP binds to TLR4 in alveolar macrophages in the lung (<xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">Inoue et al., 2006</xref>), and we previously found the necessity of TLR4 in microglial changes in offspring in response to prenatal DEP exposure in the absence of MS (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bolton et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, loss of TLR4 did not prevent the increase in proinflammatory cytokines we see after combined DEP + MS exposure (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1H</xref>). In contrast DEP + MS treatment in TLR4 KOs resulted in a greatly exaggerated IL-6 response in pregnant dams (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1I</xref>). This result points to maternal stress as a critical component of our MIA model, which cannot be blocked by inhibiting a single innate immune activation pathway.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>MIA produces lasting changes in communication and social behavior</title><p id="P16">To investigate the impact of combined prenatal stressors on the health and behavior of offspring, we measured litter outcomes and social and communication behavior across development (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). DEP + MS did not alter litter size or sex composition postnatally (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>). Male and female DEP + MS offspring weigh significantly less beginning at P8 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2B</xref>). Importantly DEP + MS exposure does not alter maternal care (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bolton et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that alterations in DEP + MS pups are driven by MIA and not by fractured maternal care.</p><p id="P17">NDDs, mostly notably ASD, are characterized by deficits in communication and social behavior. In neonatal mice, communication behavior can be measured by briefly separating pups from the dam, which elicits ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), an innate form of communication that promotes maternal care (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Amato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">Okabe et al., 2013</xref>). In wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice, peak USV production occurs at P8 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2C</xref>); thus, to probe for developmental changes, we recorded USVs from P7 to P9. We found that DEP + MS pups emit more calls and spend more time calling at P8 than CON pups (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>), mimicking phenotypes reported in other MIA models and in a genetic mouse model of autism (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Carlezon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R98" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). This increased number of calls in DEP + MS offspring was also evident at P7 but was no longer significantly different by P9 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2D</xref>); furthermore, we found no differences in the frequency (kHz) of calls at any age (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2E</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To probe whether the acoustic structure of USVs was altered we used a machine-learning tool, Mouse Ultrasonic Profile ExTraction (MUPET), to identify distinct repertoire/syllable units (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref rid="R94" ref-type="bibr">Van Segbroeck et al., 2017</xref>). Using MUPET, we extracted 80 different repertoire units from P8 USVs and organized them from shortest to longest (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). This analysis revealed that while DEP + MS offspring emit more USVs across the whole repertoire of syllables, there is a preferential increase in shorter, less complex calls (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these results show that prenatal exposure to combined stressors alters pup-to-dam communication during a peak developmental window.</p><p id="P19">To probe whether more complex social behaviors are modified, we tested CON and DEP + MS mice in a three-chamber social preference task during the juvenile period (~P30). In this task, mice are placed into a three-chamber arena, where they are given a choice to interact with a novel object or a social stimulus (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). As expected, we found that both CON male and female mice exhibit a normal preference for the social stimulus (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). On the other hand, we found a significant reduction in the social preference score of DEP + MS offspring, with a significant interaction of sex by condition. <italic toggle="yes">Post hoc</italic> analyses revealed that while DEP + MS females exhibit a normal preference for the social stimulus, DEP + MS males show no preference for the social stimulus over the object and have significantly diminished sociability compared with CON males (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2F</xref>).</p><p id="P20">Next, mice were tested in a social novelty preference task. In this task, juvenile mice are placed into the same three-chamber arena but are given a choice to interact with a sex-matched littermate or a novel mouse matched for age, sex, and condition (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Once again, male and female CON mice exhibit the expected preference for the novel stimulus, whereas DEP + MS male mice interact significantly less with the novel social stimulus (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Collectively these data reveal a male-specific effect of DEP + MS on social behavior.</p><p id="P21">We next tested whether changes in social and communication behavior persist into adulthood in DEP + MS offspring. Because social deficits were only apparent in males, we studied an adult male-specific communication behavior, &#x02018;&#x02018;courtship song.&#x02019;&#x02019; In this assay, males with sexual experience emit USVs in the presence of a sexually receptive females (i.e., females in estrus or proestrus) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>), which drives female mate choices (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Chabout et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Hammerschmidt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R104" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 1998</xref>). We found no differences in the number or mean frequency of calls emitted (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2G</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2H</xref>) in the courtship song of DEP + MS males compared with CON males. However, when we analyzed the acoustic properties of the calls, the individual calls were significantly shorter in DEP + MS mice, resulting in a significant reduction in the time spent vocalizing (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2L</xref> and <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2M</xref>).</p><p id="P22">As before, we performed MUPET analyses and identified 120 distinct repertoire units in both CON and DEP + MS males (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2I</xref>). These analyses revealed that DEP + MS male offspring have a preferential increase in short and less complex calls and a reduction in longer and more complex call types (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>). Importantly, when presented with a choice, female mice prefer courtship songs that are longer and more complex (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Chabout et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting DEP + MS males produce less competitive songs. This observed reduction in call complexity in adult DEP + MS males is similar to the changes in call complexity observed in neonatal DEP + MS offspring, which also preferentially emit calls that are shorter and less complex (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Collectively, these data reveal that changes in vocalization persist into adulthood in DEP + MS males.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>MIA alters gene expression in the prefrontal cortices of neonatal offspring</title><p id="P23">To investigate the molecular changes underlying behavioral differences, we analyzed gene expression in the prefrontal cortices (PFCs) of P8 DEP + MS and CON male and female pups.

We found that USVs are disrupted in DEP + MS pups at P8, and, in our transcriptome analyses, we found a DEP + MS male-specific downregulation of excitatory synapse genes at P8, a time point corresponding to heightened TC synaptogenesis.

From P6 to P15, TC synapse density increases 5-fold (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) and the ACC becomes increasingly organized and pseudo-laminated (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, we found that microglia undergo a period of rapid development, dramatically increasing in density and coverage between P8 and P10 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). To assess whether this period coincides with peak synapse elimination, we used Imaris to perform 3D reconstructions of microglia to visualize internalized VGlut2 within microglial lysosomal compartments (CD68) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>).

Quantification of VGlut2+ within microglial lysosomes revealed that TC synapse engulfment peaks at P8 and is primarily completed by P10 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). These data show that the period between P8 and P10 represents a critical window of microglial engulfment of TC synapses.</p><p id="P35">Next, to determine if TC synaptic structures are altered in the ACC of DEP + MS mice, we quantified the number of TC synapses in male and female offspring at P8, at P15 when TC synapses reach their peak density, and in adulthood (&#x0003e;P60) when synapse density is relatively stable (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>).

At P15, the peak of TC synapse abundance in WT mice, male DEP + MS offspring had a significant reduction in TC synapse number compared with CON males (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), and this decrease persisted into adulthood in males (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).

In sum, microglia from male DEP + MS offspring engulf fewer TC synapses at P10, are less phagocytic, and have alterations in the distribution of CD68. Together our results indicate two unexpected phenomena. First, contrary to our initial hypothesis, microglia from DEP + MS males have diminished phagocytic function overall, and second, this diminished function only affects a subset of microglia.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Combined prenatal stressors lead to an increase in functional heterogeneity of male microglia</title><p id="P37">In DEP + MS males, we found diminished TC input engulfment by microglia at P10, suggesting that the reduction in TC synapse density by P15 cannot be attributed to enhanced microglial engulfment of synapses.

To investigate this possibility, we quantified microglia cell density in the ACC at P8, P15, and P25 in CON and DEP + MS offspring. To do so, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies against P2ry12 and Iba1 and independently labeled these antigens by using separate fluorophores. Microglia were identified by P2ry12 and/or Iba1 signal, co-localizing with the nuclear marker DAPI (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). There were no significant differences in the total density of microglial cells between CON and DEP + MS male offspring across all ages (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), showing that changes in microglia numbers are not likely to underlie alterations in synaptic development.

This observation suggests that these microglia subtypes do not reflect a pathological brain state but rather are part of a normal developmental process.

To do so, we labeled the ACC microglia with Iba1, P2ry12, and CD68. Using Imaris, we reconstructed a total of 120 Iba1<sup>hi</sup>P2ry12<sup>hi</sup>, Iba1<sup>hi</sup>P2ry12<sup>lo</sup>, and Iba1<sup>lo</sup>P2ry12<sup>hi</sup> microglia and quantified the lysosomal content, a proxy for phagocytic activity, within each microglial subtype (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).

To test this possibility, we targeted microglia phagocytic function in the ACC by microinjecting neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF) into the ACC of WT mice at P7, the period immediately before the peak in pruning. Microglial activation and phagocytosis of debris in the brain is in part mediated through the complement system via the activation of CR3 (CD11b/CD18) through opsonized proteins such as iC3b (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Borucki et al., 2020</xref>).

To determine whether this reduction in CD68 impaired microglial interactions with VGlut2 synapses, we once again performed Imaris reconstructions and quantified the volume of VGlut2 within microglia (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Microglia from NIF-treated animals are significantly smaller (~25%) than PBS control animals (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>); furthermore, this size reduction is accompanied by a significant decrease in the volume of internalized VGlut2 in microglia cells (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>).

These data demonstrate that transient loss of function of microglia in the ACC is sufficient to induce changes in social behavior and demonstrate a cellular mechanism by which environmental stressors alter the development of neural circuits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P46">Immune dysfunction in pregnant mothers is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of NDDs and is strongly linked to male-offspring-specific behavioral outcomes (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2020</xref>). Here we show that prenatal co-exposure to two highly prevalent environmental factors, air pollution and maternal stress, is sufficient to induce MIA and significantly increase stress hormones in pregnant mice. Both male and female offspring born to these dams had altered USVs as neonates, whereas sociability and social novelty preference deficits during the juvenile period were observed only in DEP + MS male offspring. Notably, gene expression changes in the prefrontal cortices of neonatal mice differed by sex, and behavioral alterations only persisted into adulthood in male mice. These data indicate that prenatal environmental insults result in a distinct response in developing male brains compared with females.</p><p id="P47">Similarly, we found that the relationship between social investigation and the activation of EN-social was no longer behaviorally relevant in adult DEP + MS males. A possible interpretation of this difference is that, during development, synaptic circuits that encode social interactions form differently in male mice exposed to DEP + MS as fetuses. In agreement with this possibility, in the ACC, a critical brain region within this network, in DEP + MS male mice we found an early overabundance of TC synapses by the end of the first postnatal week. Changes in microglial function have been described in several neurological disorders. We found that microglia from DEP + MS males were less phagocytic and engulfed fewer synapses. Moreover, we discovered ACC microglia have a developmentally regulated antigenic and functional heterogeneity. This heterogeneity was strongly enhanced in males prenatally exposed to DEP + MS, leading to the overabundance of one specific subtype of microglia with a severely diminished phagocytic activity that eliminated fewer TC synapses. Taken together, our findings are in line with a loss-of-function phenotype within ACC microglia. Indeed, specific inhibition of phagocytic function within the ACC at P7 in WT mice decreased TC synapse elimination and induced a social deficit at P30, thus phenocopying the impact of the prenatal stressors. These data are consistent with previous findings on microglial heterogeneity within distinct brain regions; i.e., if microglial phagocytosis levels are not finely tuned to clearance requirements within a given brain region, this can result in aberrant brain development and altered behavior (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Ayata et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="P48">In conclusion, our combined stressor model has allowed us to rigorously investigate the mechanisms underlying abnormal brain development in response to these pervasive environmental factors. Our findings elucidate a mechanism by which environmental pollutants can synergize with psychosocial stress in pregnant mothers and induce MIA, which has specific long-term effects on the development and function of male brains. This is particularly concerning, now more than ever, because ongoing climate change caused by increased economic activity and reduced environmental protection enforcements have led to a rapid worsening of air quality in recent years. Heightened air pollution is likely to synergize with social stressors in vulnerable populations, causing further disparities in the well-being of future generations. Therefore, our findings provide an important first step toward revealing the non-genetic causes for NDDs so that preventative and therapeutic approaches can be developed along with informed policy changes.</p><sec id="S12"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="P49">In disorders such as autism, early overgrowth of synaptic connectivity is often followed by atrophy, but the mechanism of the atrophy remains unknown. Here we see a similar phenotype, but we know that the loss of TC synapses cannot be explained by exuberant synapse elimination by microglia; thus, how these synapses are lost remains unclear. Synapses can be removed via multiple mechanisms, including astrocyte-mediated elimination (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Chung et al., 2013</xref>). Astrocytes are macroglial cells that mediate synapse formation, functional maturation, and elimination. In particular, several studies revealed essential roles for astrocytes in controlling TC synapse formation and maturation (<xref rid="R77" ref-type="bibr">Risher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">Stogsdill et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, neuroimmune insults are known to trigger different reactive profiles in astrocytes, which may also be happening in DEP + MS male brains, potentially underlying synapse loss and circuit dysfunction (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>). Thus future investigations are needed to determine if astrocytes or other brain cell types are also involved in the dysfunctional synaptic development that we observe in DEP + MS male brains. Furthermore, we found a loss in the correlation between social investigation and the activation of EN-social. While we hypothesize this loss is due to a male-specific vulnerability in circuit development, an alternative possibility is that this correlation is lost due to ceiling effects, as low-preference animals are not present in the DEP + MS male group. Finally, future studies investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying male and female responses to MIA are needed to further understand why male brains are more vulnerable or female brains are protected (<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S13"><title>STAR&#x02605;METHODS</title><sec id="S14"><title>RESOURCE AVAILABILITY</title><sec id="S15"><title>Lead contact</title><p id="P50">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Staci Bilbo (<email>Staci.bilbo@duke.edu</email>).</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Materials availability</title><p id="P51">This study did not generate a new unique reagent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S17"><title>Data and code availability</title><list list-type="bullet" id="L1"><list-item><p id="P52">RNA-sequencing data have been deposited at GEO and are publicly available as of the date of publication.

The floor of the arena was constructed using a one-way mirror that allowed for video recording from beneath to avoid obstruction from the electrophysiological recording equipment. Plastic, circular holding cages (8.3 cm diameter and 12 cm tall) were centered in each of the two chambers and were used to house either a novel object or sex- and age-matched C3H target mouse.

Subsequently, mice underwent ten separate social preference test sessions, with at least one day off in between sessions, in which the test mice were allowed to freely explore the arena for ten minutes; the holding cages contained either a novel object or novel C3H target mouse. The side of the chamber holding the object/mouse was determined pseudorandomly, such that the object/mouse would not be placed in the same chamber on more than two consecutive sessions in order to prevent side biases and to distinguish target-specific effects from location-specific effects. Plastic toys and glass objects were used as novel objects, with the object being between 3&#x02013;5 cm in all directions.

First, we estimated the envelope of the signal in each channel using the magnitude of the Hilbert transform. For any 1-second window where the envelope exceeds above a pre-selected low threshold, the entire segment is removed if the envelope exceeds a second, high threshold at any point within that window. The two thresholds were determined independently for each brain region. The high threshold was selected to be 5 times the median absolute deviation of the envelope value for that region. Five median absolute deviations were chosen as the high threshold because it is roughly equivalent to 3 standard deviations from the mean for normally distributed data but is robust to outliers in the data. The low threshold was empirically chosen to be 3.33% of the high threshold. If more than half the window was removed for a channel, we removed the rest of that window for that channel as well. In addition, any windows where the standard deviation of the channel is less than 0.01 were also removed. Using this approach, 13&#x000b1;3.5% of the data per mouse were excluded from this analysis.

Sequencing was performed blind to sample identity by Sequencing and Genomic Technologies Shared Resource Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology. Extracted total RNA quality and concentration were assessed on Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies) and Qubit 2.0 (ThermoFisher Scientific), respectively. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the commercially available KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq Kit (Roche). In brief, mRNA transcripts are first captured using magnetic oligo-dT beads, fragmented using heat and magnesium, and reverse transcribed using random priming. During the 2<sup>nd</sup> strand synthesis, the cDNA: RNA hybrid is converted into double-stranded cDNA (dscDNA) and dUTP incorporated into the 2<sup>nd</sup> cDNA strand, effectively marking the second strand. Illumina sequencing adapters are then ligated to the dscDNA fragments and amplified to produce the final RNA-seq library. The strand marked with dUTP is not amplified, allowing strand-specificity sequencing. Libraries were indexed using a dual indexing approach allowing for all the libraries to be pooled and sequenced on the same sequencing run. Before pooling and sequencing, fragment length distribution for each library was first assessed on a Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were also quantified using Qubit. The molarity of each library was calculated based on qubit concentration and average library size. All libraries were then pooled in an equimolar ratio and sequenced. Sequencing was done on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer. The pooled libraries were sequenced on an S-Prime flow cell at 50 bp paired-end. Once generated, sequence data were demultiplexed, and Fastq files were generated using bcl2fastq v2.20.0.422 file converter from Illumina.</p></sec><sec id="S46"><title>Transcriptome data analysis methods</title><p id="P92">RNA-seq data was processed by the Genomic Analysis and Bioinformatics Shared Resource, Duke Center for Genomics and Computational Biology using the TrimGalore toolkit (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore</ext-link>) which employs Cutadapt (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Martin, 2011</xref>) to trim low-quality bases and Illumina sequencing adapters from the 3<sup>&#x002b9;</sup> end of the reads.

A one-way sample t-test was used to compare data sets against expected means, the student&#x02019;s t-test was used to analyze data sets with two groups or a Rank-sum test for nonparametric data. One-way ANOVAs were used to analyze data sets with more than two groups. Two-way ANOVAs were used to analyze data sets with two independent variables. Nested analyses were performed for sets of data using biological replicates. Levene&#x02019;s test for homogeneity of variance was used to determine differences in distribution. Spearman&#x02019;s correlation was used to test the relationship between two variables, and analysis of covariance was used to test the regression pattern between two groups.

It was reported that circ-10720 serves as a biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma and is positively correlated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00511-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Hsa_circ_0070963 inhibits liver fibrosis by regulation of miR-223-3p and LEMD3.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00511-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The findings suggest that targeting circRNAs is a promising therapeutic strategy. However, the expression and function of circRNAs in RILF remain largely unexamined. Because conventional 2D cell culture is sensitive to irradiation, it restricts observation of the chronic phenotype of liver fibrosis induced by high-dose irradiation. To study RILF, we successfully established a 3D spheroid model of LX-2 cells, which greatly facilitated this research. To examine the mechanism of activation and fibrogenic response of LX-2 cells to irradiation, a circRNA microarray was used to screen differentially expressed circRNAs in irradiated and nonirradiated LX-2 cells in our previous study.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00511-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Among the significantly different circRNAs, circTUBD1 (hsa_circ_0044897) caught our attention because it was significantly upregulated, and its change was consistent with the activation of LX-2 cells. In this study, its role and regulation mechanism were further investigated in a 3D spheroid model of human HSCs LX-2 cells and in RILF mice models.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>3D spheroid culture</title><p>LX-2 cells were purchased from the Shanghai Academy of Life Sciences (Shanghai, China) and cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s Modified Eagle Medium (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA). LX-2 cells were seeded into ultra low-attachment 96-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) at 3,000 viable cells per well in 200 &#x000b5;L specific culture medium with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL streptomycin. The spheroids were sufficiently compact at 3 days after seeding, and 50% of the medium was exchanged daily with fresh medium. Spheroids were transferred to spinner flasks and maintained on a constant temperature cell shaker with stirring at 50 rpm.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cell irradiation with X-rays</title><p>To minimize cell activation, the cells were cultured for 3&#x02013;5 generations after irradiation.

All antibodies were diluted in 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumen in phosphate buffered saline. Sections were then probed with a Cy3-conjugated goat antimouse or antirabbit IgG secondary antibody for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. Nuclei were stained with antifade mounting medium containing diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China).

Biotin-circTUBD1 and its negative probe were incubated with 600 &#x003bc;g streptavidin magnetic beads (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to form a biotin-coupled RNA complex.

Our previous studies showed that LX-2 cells immediately secreted large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) 24 h after irradiation, which regulated by circTUBD1/miR-146a-5p/TLR4 pathway.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00511-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In this study, we found that HSCs began to synthesize a large amount of collagen at 48 h after radiation.

Our LX-2 cell spheroid model also revealed an irradiation-induced activation of the TGF-&#x003b2;/SMAD3 signaling pathway. Anti-TGF-&#x003b2; therapy is a potential therapeutic strategy against RILF. Nevertheless, direct antagonization of TGF-&#x003b2; activity to reduce RILF will be a challenge because TGF-&#x003b2; is active in maintaining normal physiological activities in various cells of the liver. Therefore, the therapeutic approach of direct targeting of TGF-&#x003b2; to inhibit liver fibrosis would introduce unavoidable side effects. But we cannot completely negate the role of the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway, as it may be a potential strategy to alleviate RILF by inhibiting downstream regulators like SMAD2 and SMAD3. Our previous study using circRNA microarrays revealed that circTUBD1 expression in LX-2 cells was specifically and significantly increased when induced by irradiation,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00511-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes results suggested that the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway ranked third among all pathways, with significant differences after knockdown of circTUBD1. The result implied that altering circTUBD1 significantly affected the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway. We further confirmed that, as a sponge of miR-203a-3p, circTUBD1 was involved in regulation of the radiation-induced LX-2 cell profibrotic response through SMAD3. Although the general components of TGF-&#x003b2;/SMADs signaling is now understood, the core issue of how to control TGF-&#x003b2;/SMAD signaling in context remains unclear.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00511-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00511-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> It has been reported that SMAD3 mediates the constitutive active loop between lncRNA PCAT7 and the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway to promote cancer metastasis.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00511-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> However, the central question of how the TGF-&#x003b2;/SMAD feedback model exerts its versatile and context-dependent functions in liver fibrosis is unclear. In this study, we found that the expression level of circTUBD1 changed after knockdown of SMAD3. Using different methods, we confirmed that SMAD3 was not only regulated by cirTUBD1, it also regulated the endogenous expression of circTUBD1 and forms a positive feedback.

Compared with the right liver, the left liver manifested infiltration of a number of inflammatory cells infiltrate around blood vessels and vascular and interstitial congestion at early stages. The regular lobular structure was partially disrupted, and excess collagen was deposited in the interstitium, especially around the vessels. Notably, we observed that irradiation induced migration of HSCs to vascular spaces from the subendothelial space of Disse, which further confirmed that HSCs have an important role in irradiation-induced collagen deposition around the vessels. These results implied that knockdown of circTUBD1 inhibited the cascade reaction induced by the circTUBD1/micro-203a-3p/Smad3 positive feedback loop and reduced collagen secretion from HSCs, may be a potential strategy to alleviate the RILF.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study clarified the activities and mechanism of circTUBD1 in the process of RILF through a circTUBD1/miR-203a-3p/SMAD3 positive feedback loop by 3D model <italic>in vitro</italic> and RILF model in vivo.

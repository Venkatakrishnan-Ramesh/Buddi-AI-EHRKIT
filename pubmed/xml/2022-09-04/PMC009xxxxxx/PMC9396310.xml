The clinical characteristics of affected patients include pruritus, fatigue, darkened urine, and jaundice. During early-stage cholestasis, patients are usually asymptomatic and may only present with elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma- glutamyl transferase (GGT). Hyperbilirubinemia may occur as disease progresses, and may lead to liver cirrhosis, liver failure, or even death.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Hepatobiliary diseases with cholestasis from various causes are called cholestatic liver diseases, and cholestasis itself further aggravates liver damage in these patients.</p><p>To help clinicians standardize the diagnosis and treatment of cholestatic liver diseases, the Chinese Society of Hepatology, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, and Chinese Society of Infectious Diseases formulated the &#x0201c;Consensus on Diagnosis and Treatment of Cholestatic Liver Diseases&#x0201d; in 2015.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Because of the publication of additional clinical data regarding cholestatic liver diseases in China since then, we updated this guideline and revised the original consensus.

Hepatocytes produce bile salt-dependent bile (about 225 mL/day) and bile salt-independent bile (about 225 mL/day), and cholangiocytes produce additional bile (about 150 mL/day). Cholestasis is a disorder caused by the reduced flow or formation of bile,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and the cause can be intrahepatic or extrahepatic. Intrahepatic cholestasis<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> is characterized by dysfunction of hepatocytes, bile canaliculus, canals of Hering, bile ductule (&#x0003c;15 &#x000b5;m,), or cholangiocytes of the interlobular bile duct (15 to 100 &#x000b5;m), without obvious manifestations of bile duct obstruction based on imaging examination. The main causes are use of drugs or alcohol, viral or bacterial infection, and immune system disorders, etc. (<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Extrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by obstruction or injuries of the septal bile duct (&#x0003e;100 &#x000b5;m), regional bile duct (300 to 400 &#x000b5;m), segmental bile duct (400 to 800 &#x000b5;m), left or right hepatic ducts, or the common bile duct to the ampulla.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Although the main causes are outside the liver, biliary cancer growing into the intrahepatic bile duct and hilar bile duct is also a cause. Bile duct stones, a malignancy from the pancreas or bile duct and ampulla, or a benign biliary stricture are the main causes of extrahepatic cholestasis, and these conditions usually cause acute cholestasis.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Cholestasis that persists more than 6 months is defined as chronic cholestasis.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It is important for clinicians to distinguish extrahepatic and intrahepatic cholestasis, but this could be difficult when only considering symptoms, signs, and biochemical parameters. Instead, a detailed diagnostic procedure is needed to distinguish these different conditions. PSC is a pathology that affects small and large intrahepatic bile ducts and/or extrahepatic bile ducts, and some patients with this condition can have intrahepatic or extrahepatic lesions (<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

A study of 1,000 patients with chronic viral hepatitis showed that 56% of them had elevated ALP or GGT at discharge, and that elevation of these enzymes was associated with increased risk for and severity of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Cao <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> performed a survey of 4,660 patients who were hospitalized with chronic liver diseases in Shanghai and reported that the total incidence of cholestasis was 10.26%, and that the incidence increased with patient age.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Clinical manifestations</title><p>In addition to the clinical symptoms caused by the original disease, cholestasis itself can cause clinical symptoms, as well as secondary changes due to alterations in bile. Patients with early-stage disease may have no symptoms or nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and epigastric discomfort. The main clinical manifestations of cholestasis are jaundice, pruritus, fatigue, steatorrhea, xanthoma, and hepatic osteodystrophy.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Biomarkers</title><p>The most common biomarkers for cholestasis are ALP, GGT, bile acid, bilirubin, and several molecular markers.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>ALP and GGT</title><p>Elevation of ALP and GGT are the most common manifestations of early cholestasis. It is generally thought that the retention of bile salts in cholestasis leads to the proliferating of small bile ductules with increase in ALP and GGT production. The mechanism by which ALP and GGT enters the blood and increases during cholestasis is still unclear. The internal pressure of the bile canaliculus and ductules leads to abnormally increased bile excretion and this increases ALP production. In addition, bile acid, because of its surface activity, dissolves ALP from lipid membranes, and this may also serum increased ALP.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Moreover, elevation of ALP can also occur during pregnancy, child growth, and in patients with bone diseases and certain tumors. Compared with other serum enzymes in these patients, GGT increases earlier and the increase remains longer. Among liver enzymes, GGT has the highest diagnostic sensitivity for cholestasis, but its specificity is low. The sensitivity and specificity of GGT in the diagnosis of cholestasis are noninferior or even better than those of ALP. If ALP and GGT are both elevated and other causes of liver injury are excluded (alcoholism, infection, etc.), this indicates damage of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. If GGT is elevated but ALP is not, this indicates damage of bile canaliculus and cholangiocytes. If ALP is elevated but GGT is not, this indicates that liver injuries can often be excluded. However, in some specific cholestatic liver diseases, such as familial intrahepatic cholestasis (FIC type 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6), and USP53 deficiency disease, the levels of combined bilirubin or bile acid are increased, but GGT is normal or often reduced.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Bile acids</title><p>Bile acid is more sensitive than bilirubin for the diagnosis of bile secretion disorder, but it is not as sensitive as ALP. Patients with many liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and acute and chronic hepatitis, have elevated serum bile acid. The normal range of fasting serum bile acid is 1.0 to 6.0 &#x000b5;mol/L, and the normal postprandial range (2 h after eating) is 6.0 to 9.0 &#x000b5;mol/L. This level of bile acid can be more than 10 &#x000b5;mol/L in patients with cholestasis, and there are standard ranges for defining mild elevation (10 to 20 &#x000b5;mol/L), moderate elevation (20 to 40 &#x000b5;mol/L), and severe elevation (&#x0003e;40 &#x000b5;mol/L).<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Although bile acid and cholic acid are sensitive markers for cholestasis, these measurements have limited use in China and elsewhere due to the lack of reliable detection methodologies and standardization, the presence of various interfering factors, and poor diagnostic specificity. The elevation of bile acid is specific to hepatobiliary diseases, the sensitivity is low and cannot be increased by the additional measurement of bile acid at 2 h after a meal.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Bilirubin</title><p>Cholestasis can cause elevated serum bilirubin, especially direct bilirubin. Hepatocellular damage can increase direct and indirect bilirubin due to abnormalities in bilirubin synthesis, conjugation, and excretion, but the increase of direct bilirubin is generally more obvious than that of indirect bilirubin. An increase of bilirubin without an increase of liver enzymes generally indicates hereditary diseases such as Gilbert&#x02019;s disease, or hemolysis diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Molecular markers</title><p>Mutations of specific genes can cause hereditary cholestatic liver diseases.

There may also be hypertrophic Kupffer cells in the sinusoid bile and cholestasis of the interlobular bile duct in the portal area, with bile plug formation. Electron microscopy typically shows edematous and shortened microvilli of the capillary bile duct, and histopathology of extrahepatic obstructive cholestasis shows bile lakes in the liver around the portal area, with bile granulomas. Long-term extrahepatic obstruction can cause secondary intrahepatic cholestasis, and late-stage cholestasis can progress to portal fibrosis or even cirrhosis.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Diagnosis</title><sec id="s7a"><title>Diagnostic criteria</title><p>There are currently no unified diagnostic criteria or specific indicators of cholestatic liver diseases, and the diagnostic value of ALP and GGT are uncertain.

Thus, in view recent progress and current understanding, the present guideline recommends a diagnosis of cholestasis when the ALP exceeds 1.5&#x000d7;ULN and the GGT exceeds 3&#x000d7;ULN, but that some specific cholestatic liver diseases (FIC 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, and USP53 deficiency) are characterized by increased conjugated bilirubin or bile acid, but normal or nearly normal GGT.

A physical examination shows obvious skin scratches, and cholangiography indicates normal intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile ducts. The disease exists on a spectrum that ranges from benign BRIC to severe PFIC. Bile duct hyperplasia is not common, but liver fibrosis can eventually develop and progress into cirrhosis or liver failure. Some patients may experience recurrent and self-limited severe pruritus and cholestasis, in which an attack lasting weeks or months is followed by no symptoms for months or years, leading to the name BRIC. At the onset of BRIC, the liver histology shows cholestasis in the hepatocytes or cholangiocytes, with no obvious fibrosis; the liver histology and function are normal during the interictal period. It was initially thought that although each individual BRIC attack was serious, progressive liver injury and cirrhosis would not occur. However, there was also evidence that some so-called BRIC cases were recurrent and progressed to end-stage liver disease, and that the word &#x0201c;benign&#x0201d; should not be used.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is also evidence that some patients only had cholestasis during infancy without recurrence, a condition called &#x0201c;transient infantile cholestasis&#x0201d;.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> FIC 1,2,4,5,6 are characterized by low GGT, and usually begins during the neonatal period.

The <italic>ABCB11</italic> gene encodes a bile salt export pump (BSEP), the only transporter of bile salt in the bile canaliculus. A defective gene causes bile acid accumulation in hepatocytes, leading to portal inflammation and giant cell hepatitis.

The tight junction protein 2 (TJP2) occurs in the junctions between epithelial cells and endothelial cells and interacts with several other proteins. Patients with TJP2 deficiency, also known as FIC4, have loss of TJP2 protein expression in severe cases (based on immunohistochemistry), often leading to death or the need for liver transplantation. Recent studies found a significant relationship between genotype and phenotype, with a continuous spectrum of clinical severity.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The synthesis, secretion, and metabolism of bile acids are finely regulated by nuclear receptor proteins. FXR (encoded by <italic>NR1H4</italic>, also called <italic>FIC5</italic>) is activated by bile acid, functions in feedback regulation, and is the most important protein in bile acid homeostasis. Patients with FIC5 can experience severe neonatal cholestasis, early onset of non-vitamin K-dependent coagulation disorders, rapid development to end-stage liver disease, and often need early liver transplantation for survival. MYO5b functions in intracellular transport and has an important role in the formation of microvilli on the surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes in the bile canaliculus. There is a close relationship between genotype and phenotype in patients with defective <italic>MYO5b</italic> genes. In particular, complete loss of the gene causes microvilli inclusion body disease; a partial loss of this gene causes wrong location of BSEP through a special toxic negative effect, and is also called FIC 6.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<italic>USP53</italic> encodes ubiquitin specific peptidase 53, a protein that interacts with TJP2.

HELLP mostly occurs during the prenatal period, and these patients have bilirubin below 85 &#x000b5;mol/L, liver necrosis, hemangioma, and evidence of hepatic rupture based on imaging. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a kind of acute hepatic steatosis that can occur during late pregnancy, mostly in young primiparas. It usually occurs during the last three months of pregnancy or early postpartum. The onset is sudden and the prognosis is poor without aggressive and rapid treatment. The clinical manifestations are similar to those of acute severe hepatitis, and it is characterized by acute liver failure, often accompanied by renal failure. Liver steatosis can be identified by imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s14a2"><title>Treatment</title><p>UDCA can be used as a first-line drug for treatment of ICP.

If pruritus does not decrease after several days of standard UDCA treatment, SAMe or rifampicin should be considered. There is also a need for increased fetal monitoring during treatment, and birth induction should be considered to reduce perinatal mortality. In particular, birth induction should be considered after 35 weeks of pregnancy if there is evidence of disease progression, no inhibition of uterine contraction, abnormal fetal movement, fetal heart rate variability or no response to a stress test, or contamination of the amniotic fluid with meconium.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Recommendations</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>We recommend the following diagnostic criteria for IPC: (1) pruritus during pregnancy; (2) increased levels of serum ALT, fasting bile acid, and glycocholic acid; and (3) exclusion of other causes of liver dysfunction or pruritus.

It differs from the senses of touch and pain in nature, persistence, and location. The existence of pruritus itself has no prognostic value and does not reflect disease severity. The pathogenesis of pruritus is not clear, but it may be related to increased activity of an autocrine movement factor (autotaxin) and the formation of lysophosphatidic acid.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In addition, bile acid salt, endogenous opioid peptide, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), hyperactivity of sensory neurons, estrogen and progesterone, hepato-intestinal pruritus changes, and genetic factors may contribute to pruritis. The relationship between pruritus and cholestasis suggests that the substances causing pruritus are normally excreted in bile. The resolution of pruritus during hepatocyte failure indicates that these substances are produced by hepatocytes, but serum bile acid remains very high in this situation.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Pruritus can be divided into three categories based on severity.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> First, a visual analog scale classifies the severity of pruritus as scratch, plaque, nodule, and/or scar according to the characteristics of skin scratches, and the degrade is 0&#x02013;3 according to the light, moderate, and severe degree, and the total score ranges from 0 to 10. Second, an Itch Severity Scale considers the frequency of itching, sleep, mood, sexual desire, sexual function, and uses a Likert scale to assess the intensity of pruritus and the total surface area of the body that is affected; the total score ranges from 0 to 21, with 21 indicating the most severe itching. Third, a semiquantitative evaluation of pruritus can be performed by recording the frequency of pruritus, with division into four stages: occasional, daily intermittent without clinical symptoms, daily intermittent with clinical symptoms, and persistent.</p><p>Several drugs can be used alone or in combination to reduce pruritus, including cholestyramine, antihistamines, pregnane X receptor agonists, opioid receptor antagonists, and 5-HT receptor antagonists. Oral cholestyramine is a first-line treatment for cholestatic pruritus.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, with a recommended dose of 4 g/day and a maximum dose of 16 g/day. When administered with other drugs (especially UDCA), cholestyramine should be taken at intervals of 4 to 6 h to prevent interactions. Rifampicin, a pregnane X receptor agonist, is a second-line treatment for pruritus. Rifampicin down-regulates ATX and reduces the formation of lysophosphatidic acid, especially in patients who are intolerant or nonresponsive to cholestyramine.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The recommended oral dose is 150 mg/day initially, and this dose can be maintained if it is effective. If necessary, the dose can be increased to 600 mg/day every other week. When rifampicin is used to treat methadone addicts, it can cause opioid withdrawal reactions. Therefore, rifampicin might relieve cholestatic pruritus due to its opioid antagonistic effects. Red urine, toxic kidney damage, liver toxicity, and hemolysis (rarely) may occur after use of rifampicin. Due to the potential of rifampicin to cause liver damage, it is necessary to closely monitor biochemical parameters during treatment. Oral naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, can be given at a dose of 25 to 50 mg/day as a third-line treatment for pruritus. Some patients have nausea, vomiting, mild pain, and other side effects due to this treatment. The metabolites of naltrexone can accumulate in patients with decompensated liver disease, so caution should be used when treating these patients. Treatment should begin with a low dose, and the dose can then be gradually increased to avoid withdrawal effects, similar to the recommendations for anesthetics.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>If the above drugs are ineffective, sertraline (a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor) can be used as a fourth-line treatment. The initial dose of 50 mg/day can be increased to 100 mg/day after a few weeks. In recent years, ultraviolet radiation, albumin dialysis, and nasobiliary drainage have been used to manage cholestatic pruritus, and favorable curative effects were reported. Liver transplantation should be considered for patients with intractable pruritus who have poor responses to drugs or other approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Recommendations</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>We recommend cholestyramine as a first-line drug for treatment of pruritis, with an initial dose of 4 g/day and a maximum dose of 16 g/day.

Because it is a non-specific symptom, the Fatigue Impact Score or the Primary Biliary Cirrhosis 40 scale (PBC-40) may be used to assess symptoms and severity.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The pathogenesis of fatigue is still not clear, and there is no effective treatment. Anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, renal and adrenal insufficiency, and depression should be excluded before treatment. At present, the possible therapeutic methods and drugs are selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron, opioid receptor antagonists, and the central nervous stimulant modafinil. The initial dose of modafinil is 100 mg/day, and it may be gradually increased to 200 mg/day according to tolerance and responsiveness, but further studies of its efficacy are needed. Although UDCA is an effective treatment for PBC, it apparently has no significant effect on the accompanying symptoms of fatigue. Even 1 year after liver transplantation, fatigue may remain a persistent symptom for these patients, although the degree of fatigue may be less. A healthy lifestyle, including adequate sleep, regular exercise, abstinence from alcohol, and avoidance of coffee at night are beneficial. Antidepressants may partly reduce the fatigue of patients with depression.</p></sec><sec id="s17b"><title>Xanthoma</title><p>Xanthomas are common in patients with chronic cholestasis. This condition is characterized by flat or slightly raised fat deposits on the skin surface that are yellow and soft and often occur around the eyes. They may also occur in the palmar fold, breast, neck, chest, and back. Their occurrence is related to an elevated level of blood lipids, with serum cholesterol usually more than 4.5 g/L. When jaundice subsides or liver failure occurs, the level of cholesterol drops and these manifestations might disappear. Xanthomas require no special treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s17c"><title>Dyslipidemia</title><p>Cholestasis inhibits the metabolism of cholesterol due to the increase of bile acid, and this often leads to lipid metabolic disorder. Thus, patients with cholestasis often have elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, although there is no evidence that this increases their risk of atherosclerosis. Statins and fibrates are safe treatments for patients who have cholestatic liver disease with lipid metabolic disorders.<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Cholestyramine can also reduce the level of blood lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s17d"><title>Steatorrhea</title><p>Steatorrhea is characterized by large stools that are soft, excessively oily, gray, and with a peculiar smell. This may occur in patients with cholestasis because the intestinal tract lacks sufficient bile salt, leading to impaired digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Thus, steatorrhea is positively correlated to the degree of jaundice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Recommendations</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>We recommend exclusion of anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal and adrenal insufficiency, and depression when a patient presents with cholestatic fatigue.

Osteoporosis is characterized by bone matrix or mineral loss and osteomalacia as osteoid mineralization defects. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is used to diagnose osteoporosis based on bone mineral density (BMD).<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-22-00147-b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> According to the diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization, BMD measured by DEXA is defined by T-score, which indicates the number of standard deviations above or below the mean (normal: T-score &#x02265; &#x02212;1.0; osteopenia: &#x02212;2.5 &#x0003c; T-score &#x0003c; &#x02212;1.0; osteoporosis: T-score &#x02264; &#x02212;2.5). The treatments for osteoporosis include following a healthy diet and lifestyle with exercise, use of calcium and vitamin D supplements, and drug interventions. The Chinese Nutrition Association recommends 800 mg calcium per day for adults and a 1,000 mg calcium per day for postmenopausal women and the elderly. The recommended dose of vitamin D for adults is 200 IU/day, and the dose for the elderly is 400 to 800 IU/day, especially when there is a lack of exposure to sunshine and/or impaired intake or absorption. The dose of vitamin D should be 800 to 1,200 IU/day for treatment of osteoporosis. Epidemiological data support the use of calcium supplements (1,000 to 1,200 mg/day) and vitamin D (400 to 800 IU/day) for reducing or reversing the rate of bone loss. Hormone replacement therapy is effective in postmenopausal women. To decrease the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, males should avoid testosterone. Research supports the use of diphosphonates (alendronate at 70 mg/week, ibandronate at 150 mg/month, or other similar drugs) to treat and prevent osteoporosis. Annual BMD measurements should be performed during follow-up to assess treatment efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s18b"><title>Deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins</title><p>Cholestasis leads to disruption in the secretion of bile from the liver to the small intestine, and this decreases bile salt in the intestine and can cause a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins and steatorrhea.

Oral vitamin A at a dose of 25,000 to 50,000 IU/day can be used to treat night blindness. Vitamin E deficiency is rare, but children with cerebellar ataxia, posterior funicular dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy and retinal degeneration, might benefit from oral supplements.

In terms of basic research, there is a need for more studies that examine the mechanisms of these diseases (especially at the molecular level), the effect of heritable risk factors and alterations of different bile acid transporters on the occurrence and development of disease, and the influence of bile acid composition on the liver and the whole body. PBC and PSC are the major cholestatic liver diseases, and their etiologies are not yet fully clear. UDCA is the main treatment for PBC, but some patients have poor responses to this drug. In addition, there is no effective drug for PSC. The epidemiology, diagnostic markers, and diagnostic criteria for cholestatic liver diseases require further studies for verification. There is also an urgent need to identify additional drugs and treatments for the different cholestatic liver diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The following experts

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) modify EGFR-TKI resistance during tumor progression. Non-structural maintenance of chromosomes condensin I complex subunit G (NCAPG) is a mitosis-related protein that is involved in tumorigenesis. We investigated the potential regulatory lncRNAs of NCAPG in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and assessed their roles in EGFR-TKI resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2002"><title>Methods</title><p>Data for 1678 lung cancer patients were retrieved from TCGA and GEO databases and used to evaluate NCAPG and lncRNAs expressions, as well as their prognostic significance in LUAD. Protein levels of NCAPG in LUAD were validated by immuno-histochemistry. To assess the relationship between NCAPG levels and EGFR-TKIs sensitivity, a cohort of 57 LUAD patients administered with EGFR-TKIs was used.</p></sec><sec id="s2003"><title>Results</title><p>Both NCAPG and lncRNA AC099850.3 were over-expressed in LUAD tissues, and correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in LUAD. LncRNA AC099850.3 was identified as a potential regulator of NCAPG expressions. The AC099850.3/NCAGP axis was markedly correlated with EGFR mutations and IC<sub>50</sub> of EGFR-TKIs. Besides, elevated NCAPG levels were associated with EGFR-TKIs resistance in 57 LUAD patients undergoing TKIs treatment. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that both AC099850.3 and NCAGP were abundant in the cell cycle and the p53 signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The AC099850.3/NCAPG axis is a potential prognostic predictor and therapeutic biomarker for EGFR-TKIs in LUAD.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>lung cancer</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd><kwd>NCAPG</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>EGFR</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="1"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Globally, lung cancer is the leading cause of tumor-associated mortality.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Intriguingly, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes more than 85% of all lung cancer cases.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This group of cancers mainly include lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC).

Assessment of potential mechanisms involved in NCAPG up-regulation in LUAD revealed that DNA copy gain and methylation might contribute to this phenomenon. Further analyses indicated that overexpressed NCAPG were markedly associated with rapid tumor progression, early recurrence as well as poor OS and PFS outcomes in LUAD patients. Importantly, COX analyses showed that NCAPG is an independent prognostic factor in LUAD. The established nomogram was shown to accurately predict the survival outcomes for LUAD patients.

Further investigations are warranted to clarify the exact roles of NCAPG and lncRNA AC099850.3 in LUAD, and whether they interact.

(4) Although the sample size for the EGFR-TKIs treated cohort was small and we were unable to conduct survival analysis due to incomplete follow-up data, we established that elevated NCAPG expressions are associated with EGFR-TKIs resistance.

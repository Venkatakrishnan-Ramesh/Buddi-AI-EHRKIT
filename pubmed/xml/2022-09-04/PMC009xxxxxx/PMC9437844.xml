The understanding of the rules defining this event has large implications for our knowledge of basic immunology and for the rational design of immuno-therapeutics and vaccines. Historically, most of the available prediction methods have been solely focused on the information related to antigen processing and presentation. Recent work has, however, demonstrated that method performance can be boosted by integrating information related to antigen abundance. Here we expand on these later findings and develop an extended version of NetMHCpan, called NetMHCpanExp, integrating information on antigen abundance from RNA-Seq experiments. In line with earlier works, the model demonstrates improved performance for both HLA ligand and cancer neoantigen epitope prediction. Optimal results are obtained by use of sample-specific abundance information but also reference datasets can be applied with a limited performance drop.

HLA antigen presentation is defined by a complex pathway consisting of multiple steps including antigen expression, antigen processing into short peptide fragments, and HLA binding and presentation on the cell surface (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Yewdell and Bennink, 1999</xref>). Given its essential role in defining cellular immunity, substantial work has been dedicated to characterize the rules of HLA peptide presentation (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Peters et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, large efforts have been vested into the development of models capable of predicting HLA antigen presentation, and the application of such models for rational vaccine development and design of targeted immuno-therapeutics (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0065">In particular, the field of cancer immunotherapy and the discovery of cancer neoepitopes have been tightly linked to the development of accurate models for the prediction of HLA presentation of tumor-specific neopeptides (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Jou et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Here, tools (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abelin et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jurtz et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Reynisson et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sarkizova et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Solleder et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>) have predominantly been trained using ligand elution data, obtained through mass spectrometry (MS) based immunopeptidomics. MS HLA eluted peptides hold information related to the natural steps of the HLA antigen processing and presentation pathway. Multiple studies have demonstrated that training prediction models on such data results in a boosted performance, compared to when peptide-MHC binding is only considered (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Jurtz et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0070">Even though a correlation between source protein abundance and the likelihood of HLA antigen presentation is expected and has earlier been proven in the literature (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abelin et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bassani-Sternberg et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Juncker et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), it is only recently that studies have shown that the direct integration of abundance of peptide source proteins (most often estimated from RNA-Seq expression values) derives in improved performance for the prediction of HLA presented ligands (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abelin et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ko&#x0015f;alo&#x0011f;lu-Yal&#x000e7;&#x00131;n et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sarkizova et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Although these studies often report highly substantial performance gains by the integration of such antigen abundance information (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abelin et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sarkizova et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), they provide limited information as to what are the detailed features of the individual peptides driving the improved performance. That is, what are the properties of peptides that undergo large changes in the likelihood of HLA antigen presentation when considering source protein abundance.</p><p id="p0075">When incorporating antigen abundance, another critical question is what source of information should be applied to estimate this feature. As mentioned above, most current studies have been based on RNA-Seq expression data owing to its ease of availability, but more recent studies suggest that the use of proteomic data might be more appropriate (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ko&#x0015f;alo&#x0011f;lu-Yal&#x000e7;&#x00131;n et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). Also, an important question relates to how to best tackle situations where sample-specific protein abundance data are not available. Here, previous studies suggest that reference datasets can be applied albeit with some degree of performance loss (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abelin et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ko&#x0015f;alo&#x0011f;lu-Yal&#x000e7;&#x00131;n et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sarkizova et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="p0080">Here, we seek to address these unresolved questions. We do this by developing an extended version of NetMHCpan-4.1 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Reynisson et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). It is important to emphasize that we are not aiming to perform a benchmark comparison of methods available for HLA antigen presentation prediction, but rather are interested in investigating properties of the immunopeptidome that define its modification as a function of antigen gene expression.</p><p id="p0085">The model is trained using a new version of NNAlign_MA (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>) allowing the integration of protein abundance information as estimated from RNA-Seq data. We train the proposed model on different datasets including either sample-specific or reference RNA-Seq data. Next, we investigate and describe in detail the properties of peptides that are &#x0201c;rescued&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;discarded&#x0201d; when considering source protein abundance. Finally, a series of evaluations is conducted on independent benchmark datasets including cancer neopeptides and epitopes to confirm the improved predictive power by the integration of source protein abundance, and to assess the impact of replacing sample-specific information with reference datasets.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><p id="p0090">To investigate how the integration of protein abundance impacts the likelihood of peptide HLA antigen presentation, and characterize properties of HLA ligands that undergo improved potential for HLA antigen presentation when originating from highly abundant proteins, we here explored a large set of HLA MS eluted ligands from a series of earlier publications (Datasets A: (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Reynisson et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>), B: (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bulik-Sullivan et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>), C: (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sarkizova et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>) and D: (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Trolle et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>); refer to <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="sec4.3" ref-type="sec">Method details</xref>).<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Summary of the training data</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Dataset</th><th>Source</th><th>Positives</th><th>Negatives</th><th>#HLAs</th><th>#cell lines</th><th>Data type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">A</td><td rowspan="2">NetMHCpan</td><td>42,020</td><td>128,550</td><td>112</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>SA (BA)</td></tr><tr><td>329,239</td><td>7,672,715</td><td>130</td><td>50</td><td>SA and MA (EL)</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>EDGE</td><td>105,672</td><td>1,344,404</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>69</td><td>MA (EL)</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>HLAthena</td><td>182,703</td><td>3,844,654</td><td>95</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>SA (EL)</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>Trolle</td><td>11,858</td><td>150,009</td><td>5</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>SA (EL)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>SA refers to single allele, MA to multi-allele, BA to binding affinity, and EL to eluted ligand datasets.

HLA likelihood presentation scores were assigned for positive MS ligands and artificially generated random negatives from the percentile EL-rank values predicted by NetMHCpan-4.1 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Reynisson et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>) and expression values in TPM (transcripts per million) were assigned from their corresponding RNA-Seq reference database (refer to <xref rid="sec4.3" ref-type="sec">Method details</xref>).</p><p id="p0100">The results of this analysis are displayed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A, and demonstrate in line with earlier results that MS ligands are preferentially distributed in low EL %rank scores and high TPM regions of the array (red cells) and are depleted for high EL %rank scores and low TPM values (blue cells). Between these two extremes, a gradient of MS ligand enrichment ratios is observed. The cells with a neutral color trace an equivalence frontier defined by the ratio of MS ligands to random negatives being equal to that expected by chance (&#x0223c;5%). This frontier shifts towards higher EL %rank values as the TPM value is increased. By way of example, the equivalence is frontier located at an EL %rank value of &#x0223c;1% for TPM values of 1, and this location is shifted to 5% when the TPM value is increased to 50. This implies that peptides that are considered to be non-binders by the NetMHCpan-4.1 prediction method can potentially become likely binders if their gene expression value is sufficiently high.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Relationship between predicted HLA binding scores of MS eluted ligands and artificially generated random negatives and the gene expression values of their corresponding source proteins</p><p>NetMHCpan-4.1 EL percentile rank scores and RNA-Seq expression values were binned to generate a 2-dimensional array where EL percentile rank scores are shown on the x-axis and TPM values on the y-axis. All compiled MS datasets (datasets A-D) were used to construct this array. The numbers on both the x and y-axis represent the rightmost edge of each bin, for instance, the cell on the upper right corner contains peptides in the range (70,100] of EL %rank scores and (500, 10000] of TPM values. As an exception, the cell in the lower left corner contains peptides in the interval [0,0.1] of EL %rank scores and [0,1] of TPM values.</p><p>(A) Each cell displays the number of MS ligands (top) and the number of random natural negative peptides (bottom) that fall into it, and it is colored according to the ratio between these two quantities, referred to as the &#x0201c;MS ligand enrichment ratio&#x0201d;. The midpoint of the color scale was set to coincide with the ratio of total MS ligands to total background peptides (white cells). Note, that some degree of overprediction is expected in this plot as dataset A was present in the training of NetMHCpan-4.1.

Here, 9-mer ligands were found to accumulate mostly in low EL %rank scores while peptides of 12 to 14 residues were preferentially found with high EL %rank scores. Additionally, for EL %rank scores &#x0003e;= 1%, we observe that, for the same EL %rank score range, the proportion of longer peptides (12 to 14-mers) is increased for higher TPM values. Overall, this points out that the peptide length preference is changing towards a lower proportion of 9-mer peptides as one moves along the equivalence frontier towards higher TPM values (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>).</p><p id="p0110">Next, we inspected the binding preferences of MS ligands in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A, constructing sequence logos for the ligands falling in each of the cells of the array (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>). Note, that these ligands originate from multiple experiments each with a different HLA background, and the individual logo plots hence do not reflect single HLA specificities. From low to high %rank scores, this figure demonstrates a clear reduction in the information content of the main anchor positions 2, 5, and 9. In contrast, the variation of gene expression values does not seem to affect the information content of the binding motifs to the same degree. For EL % rank scores &#x0003e;10% and gene expression values &#x0003e;50 TPM, the logos are highly enriched with K and Rs in position 9. This bias most probably derives from enrichment of tryptic peptides, common bystander contaminants of HLA MS elution studies originating from residual peptides present in the LC column derived from earlier conventional proteomics trypsin digestions (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).

In this respect, it is important to note that for models only trained only on datasets B-D, dataset A plays the role of an external dataset, and therefore the performance of the models on this data is not comparable, on a fair basis, with the one obtained for models trained on the complete datasets A-D.</p><p id="p0140">In relation to datasets B-D (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B), the models MS(wexp):INT (yellow) and MS(wexp):HPA (green) significantly outperformed all other models in all performance evaluations with the exception of PPV where this was only the case for MS(wexp):INT (yellow).

To investigate how this influences the model performance, an expression mapping strategy was implemented where all TPM values were annotated based on a recalibration with the HPA data (refer to <xref rid="sec4.3" ref-type="sec">Method details</xref>). The results of these comparisons are shown in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref> and demonstrate that this experimental design choice has no interference with the predictions of the trained models.</p><p id="p0150">Two main conclusions can be drawn from these results. Firstly, models trained on datasets including gene expression significantly (all p-values&#x0003c;0.05, two-tailed Binomial test) outperformed models without this feature. Secondly, models trained on MS ligands with internal RNA-Seq reference assays had an improved performance compared to models trained using gene expression values obtained from an external reference. However, the difference was consistently very small and, in many cases, insignificant (refer to the lowercase letters on top of the models in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>). This last result suggests that sample-specific RNA-Seq data are not essential to achieve improved power for the prediction of HLA antigen presentation. We propose that this is mainly driven by two factors: 1. the high correlation between matched and average reference RNA-Seq data (refer to <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>) and, 2. the overall high variability in RNA-Seq data for biological replicates, product of the stochastic nature of gene expression (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), resulting in more robust annotations when taking median transcript expression values across multiple samples as in the case of the HPA dataset.</p><p id="p0155">The results in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B show that the models trained with the entire enlarged dataset (A-D) did not surpass in performance the models trained with a subset of the dataset (B-D) only. We hypothesize this is because adding dataset B-D to dataset A only expanded the net HLA allele and peptide coverage of the models to a limited degree. Indeed, datasets B-D cover 109 HLA alleles of which 102 (94%) are covered by 100 or more positive data points (after motif deconvolution of the MA data). Datasets A-D comprise 163 HLA alleles (after motif deconvolution of the MA data). However, this data only &#x0201c;rescues'' 3 of the poorly covered HLA in the B-D dataset. This demonstrates that in the context of the B-D datasets, dataset A adds limited novel information. Nevertheless, we also have to take into account that the models trained on datasets B-D only may experience some degree of bias towards these data compared to models trained on the entire dataset, given that dataset A adds approximately the same amount of positive instances as datasets B-D. Taken together, these factors explain the behavior of the trained models with model MS(woexp):HPA&#x000a0;+ MS(wexp):INT performing overall best, and model MS(wexp):INT performing best when evaluated on the B-D datasets.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Properties of selected and deselected binders</title><p id="p0160">To further describe and characterize the effect of gene expression on the likelihood of HLA antigen presentation, we next investigated the properties of the MS ligands that were favored by including the gene expression values in the training of our models.

In terms of the UB peptides, they share properties complementary to the improved binders (IB and VIB). That is, they are found prevalently for peptide length different from 9 and low TPM values (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;3</xref>A and 3B). To further investigate the properties of deselected peptides, we turned to the use of predictions. Here, HLA-A&#x02217;02:01 antigen presentation was predicted for peptides in a set of 5,000 proteins randomly sampled from the human proteome with TPM values assigned from the HPA reference RNA-Seq database using models with and without the integration of protein expression. The results of this analysis are displayed as the proportion of observed ligands/predicted binders as compared to background peptides, as a function of antigen expression in different TPM ranges (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>). This plot clearly demonstrates the important effect of including expression levels in the search for HLA presented peptides, i.e. the reduced proportion of predicted binders from transcripts with low expression levels and a likewise increased sampling from highly expressed transcripts. This effect combined with the increased likelihood of identifying true HLA ligands in highly expressed transcripts (refer to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>) directly translates into an improved predictive specificity. If the proportion of predicted binders is compared to the proportion of ligands in the range of lowly expressed antigens (TPM&#x0003c;1), these analyses demonstrate a 5 times decreased false positive prediction rate of the model trained including antigen expression compared to the model trained without. That is, the proportion of ligands in this TPM range is &#x0223c;0.004, which is in agreement with what is predicted by the model trained including antigen expression (using a predicting threshold of 0.5% rank). In contrast, the corresponding value for the model trained excluding antigen expression is 0.02.</p><p id="p0175">In summary, these results suggest that improved binders consist of non-canonical binders with limited binding potential &#x0201c;rescued&#x0201d; by high gene expression values, whereas deselected binders consist of imperfect binders, being &#x0201c;discarded&#x0201d; owing to their low gene expression values.</p><p id="p0180">Furthermore, we explored the distribution of the different groups of peptides in the same array constructed for <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> (see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>). Not surprisingly, most of the improved and very improved binders fall in cells that are left wise of the previously defined frontier of equivalence (shown in bright colors in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). This also implies that the potential contaminant peptides illustrated in <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref> are not interfering with our results. Finally, it is important to mention that the majority of ligands belong to the category of conserved binders (&#x0223c;80%) and only a small fraction (&#x0223c;8%) are IB and VIB. This means that peptides that are &#x0201c;positively&#x0201d; affected by gene expression experience, in their majority, only undergo a very small absolute variation in their %rank scores (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S8</xref>).

Given the larger allelic coverage of the data used to train MS(woexp):HPA&#x000a0;+ MS(wexp):INT, this method was selected for a web-server implementation termed NetMHCpanExp.

The method comes in two flavors, one that integrates information on protein expression and one that does not. The latter method is identical to the MS(woexp&#x000a0;+ wexp) developed in this work. The tool takes two input formats: PEPTIDE and FASTA. For PEPTIDE input, antigen expression can be provided directly as TPM values or as protein ID(s) (referring either to the HPA reference database or to a user-defined database file). If no TPM value is provided, TPM values are obtained by summing over TPM values for all transcripts in the HPA reference database containing the queried peptide. For FASTA input, the TPM value can be specified in the header of the file. Alternatively, the protein ID in the FASTA header can be employed to either perform a search against the HPA database or a user-customized reference database. As a last option, the user can choose to digest the protein sequence in the FASTA file into overlapping peptides of a given length(s) and search for each one of those peptides individually in the HPA reference database. In this case, gene expression value annotation is conducted in the same manner as for PEPTIDE input, without specified TPM values.

Although the differences in the AUC values between the models that include or not gene expression reported in this work might seem marginal, they have an important impact when prioritizing a large number of peptides to be further tested in a web lab setting. By way of example, we find a gain in sensitivity of the different methods trained including gene expression compared to the ones trained without that translates into a discovery of hundreds of additional positives in real-life antigen discovery experiments, such as whole organism immunopeptidomics, where often thousands of positive targets are screened.</p><p id="p0235">Earlier works have demonstrated that including source protein abundance values improves the predictive power of peptide-HLA binding methods (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abelin et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ko&#x0015f;alo&#x0011f;lu-Yal&#x000e7;&#x00131;n et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sarkizova et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). In line with these studies, our current work shows that transcript abundance values measured via high-throughput RNA-Seq assays serve as suitable estimates of antigen source protein abundance values. This was proven both in cross-validation and on the independent benchmarks of MS ligands and cancer neoepitopes, where the newly developed methods trained with gene expression significantly surpassed their equivalents trained without this feature. In addition, we investigated in detail the impact of employing internal or external reference transcriptomics experiments to annotate peptide gene expression values. Our results demonstrated that internal gene expression references constitute a more accurate estimate of antigen abundances and consequently enhance the performance of the prediction methods to a higher degree than external ones. All the same, it was observed, both in cross-validation and on the independent benchmarks, that replacing the internal gene expression references with external ones can be conducted with a very small loss in performance. This conclusion has powerful implications: it is possible to benefit from the integration of antigen abundance information without the need for paired RNA-Seq assays.</p><p id="p0240">As stated before, most studies apply transcript abundance values measured via high-throughput RNA-Seq assays as an indirect estimate of protein abundances. Many factors, biological, technical, and computational, can affect gene expression value estimation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Arora et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). In order to augment the benefit from such RNA-Seq data in the context of the prediction of HLA antigen presentation this observation suggests that a clear improvement could be achieved if a common RNA-Seq processing pipeline is adopted limiting, at least, the bioinformatic bias in the data. As a part of this work, a recalibration strategy, that could potentially help to lessen the mentioned biases in the gene expression data (refer to <xref rid="sec4.3" ref-type="sec">Method details</xref>) was investigated. However, we observed no improvement in the model performances both in cross-validation and in the independent evaluation. We would like to point out that this conclusion is likely to be very specific to the datasets used in this study, stemming from the relative homogeneity of the experimental conditions in which gene expression was measured, and would suggest that such recalibration procedures could prove to be beneficial when gathering gene expression data from more heterogeneous sources.</p><p id="p0245">Furthermore, we and others have suggested the use of data other than RNA-Seq for the estimation of protein abundance, including proteomics (such as PAXdb (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>)), and RiboSeq data (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ingolia, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ko&#x0015f;alo&#x0011f;lu-Yal&#x000e7;&#x00131;n et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). Currently, the results related to the benefits of including such alternative protein abundance estimates for an improved prediction of HLA antigen presentation remain inconclusive, and more extensive studies are needed to fully evaluate their potential.</p><p id="p0250">As a side remark, there is an open discussion in the literature about how prevalent proteasome-spliced peptides are in the HLA ligandome. Some works claim these peptides are predominant (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Faridi et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Liepe et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), whereas others suggest that they constitute only a small fraction of the presented HLA ligands (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Mylonas et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sarkizova et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). This contradictory evidence reveals that more work needs to be conducted in the field to clarify this issue, especially as it would have a direct impact on the validity of the methods employed to annotate gene expression values.</p><p id="p0255">It is essential to underline that we here have not conducted any benchmark comparisons of our developed tool and that we hence do not make any claims related to method superiority. We believe such method comparisons are best left for future studies conducted on novel independent data. Rather, we have thoroughly investigated the properties of MS binders that are &#x0201c;favored&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;unfavored&#x0201d; by the incorporation of gene expression values, as we believe identifying such properties will enable better understanding and use of the results produced by the developed models. In these analyses, we find that improved MS binders represent only &#x0223c;8.3% of the data and are mostly composed of highly expressed, non-canonical binding peptides, with length different from 9 and a degree of &#x0201c;alternative&#x0201d; amino acids in their primary and/or secondary anchor positions. Unimproved and lost MS binders constitute an even smaller percentage of the training set (&#x0223c;2.6%) and predominantly derive from low abundant proteins. In summary, these observations imply that peptides with suboptimal binding properties may still act as binders if they are sufficiently abundant and, on the other hand, they may be disfavoured in their likelihood to bind to MHC if their gene expression value is too low.</p><p id="p0260">As our developed method tends to &#x0201c;rescue&#x0201d; more MS-ligands than &#x0201c;discard&#x0201d; them by the inclusion of the new feature, it would be reasonable to think that the exploration of new extrinsic peptide features may allow the recovery of a higher proportion of the ligandome measured by mass spectrometry (i.e. UnClassified peptides (UC) and Lost Binders (LB) in our training set). Nevertheless, as studied earlier (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abelin et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sarkizova et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), the gene expression value measured at the RNA level is the most informative peptide extrinsic feature when predicting peptide-HLA binding (outperforming immunoproteasome cleavability scores and HLA gene presentation bias, among the most prominent ones). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that including more peptide extrinsic features will massively increase our explanatory power of the &#x0201c;trash&#x0201d; ligandome.</p><p id="p0265">Considering the main differences in our method to others in the same line (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abelin et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ko&#x0015f;alo&#x0011f;lu-Yal&#x000e7;&#x00131;n et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sarkizova et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), we would like to highlight the following: 1) NetMHCpanExp is pan-allele and pan-length specific, 2) it can handle multi-allelic data as it is built on NNAlign_MA, 3) it accepts peptides of a wide length range of 8 to 14 amino acids. Although 1) and 2) stress the versatility of our method, 3) relate to a very important aspect of this work. Not only 8 to 11-mers should be included in the training of prediction tools that incorporate gene expression values, but also 12 to 14-mers as these peptides are highly enriched in improved binders.</p><p id="p0270">In conclusion, we have developed NetMHCpanExp allowing for HLA antigen presentation prediction by integrating information on antigen abundance. The tool is publicly available, and we expect that it with its ease of use will guide the characterization of the HLA immunopeptidome and development of future T&#x000a0;cell-based immuno-therapeutics.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="p0275">The current method can only be used to predict human MHC class I alleles owing to the fact that its training dataset relies on large-scale paired MS-RNA-Seq assays that were performed over human cell lines or tissues. It would be interesting to expand our model to non-human MHC class I alleles when the required biological data become available.</p><p id="p0280">Furthermore, a direct application of the model for the identification of pathogen epitopes is not trivial. Given the transient nature of pathogenic infection, the relative abundance of pathogenic proteins is highly variable over time. This is a major obstacle when considering incorporating pathogen gene expression levels to improve the prediction of HLA antigen presentation. Nevertheless, it has been already demonstrated that, for the case of SARS-CoV-2 virus, incorporating transcript relative abundances from Ribo-Seq assays or protein abundances measured via proteomic experiments can improve CD8<sup>+</sup> epitope predictions (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ko&#x0015f;alo&#x0011f;lu-Yal&#x000e7;&#x00131;n et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="p0285">The current work has been limited to HLA class I, but the proposed modeling framework is readily extendable also to HLA class II, and in line with other earlier work including (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), it is expected that also here would integrating of antigen abundance result in improved predictive power for the prediction of HLA antigen presentation.</p><p id="p0290">Moreover, and particularly in relation to the prediction of cancer neoepitopes, our work does not address the impact of replacing patient-specific expression data with cancer-type-matched expression data from public databases, which is especially relevant if the former information is not available. Investigating this would allow us to confirm that the predictive power of our tool is only marginally affected by employing external gene expression references, also in this scenario.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>STAR&#x02605;Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Key resources table</title><p id="p0295">

This data was acquired from 70 individuals with metastatic cancer with at least one HLA class I-restricted epitope and paired tumor sample RNA-sequencing. Whole-exome analysis of the tumor samples allowed the identification of mutations (indels and snvs) generating a large set of nmers consisting of the mutated residue and 12-flanking upstream and downstream residues. Of the 9,541&#x000a0;nmers tested for immunoreactivity, 139 were recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and were defined as positives. Our dataset contains the positive and negative nmers and their corresponding minimal mutated peptides (MMPs), which are 8- to 12-mers containing the mutation. Each of the nmers had an associated gene expression decile, which was subsequently replaced by a gene expression value in TPM using the HPA dataset as a reference and transformed as described above.</p><p id="p0395">Finally, and in order to further evaluate the performance of our selected baseline model against NetMHCpan-4.1, three sets of external CD8<sup>+</sup> epitopes were employed.</p><p id="p0400">The first set consisted in the TESLA consortium neoepitope dataset (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Wells et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), which is composed of 608 peptide-MHCs tested for immunogenicity with multimer-based assays. This data was pooled with another 310 assayed peptide-MHCs used for validation on an independent cohort, also in the mentioned paper. Finally, peptide-MHCs without available gene expression were filtered out, resulting in 714 peptide-MHCs in total (33 positives).</p><p id="p0405">Moreover, two other sets of CD8<sup>+</sup> epitopes were constructed, one was extracted from the Immune Epitope DataBase (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Vita et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>) (refer to NetMHCpan-4.1 external evaluation dataset from IEDB) and the other one was derived from a large and comprehensive mapping of T&#x000a0;cell epitopes Yellow Fever Virus (YFV) vaccinees (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Stryhn et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). To prevent an overestimation of the performance of the models on these epitope benchmarks, peptides overlapping with the training datasets of any of the two methods were left-out. In the case of the IEDB set, the common motif algorithm was employed to discard peptides, both positives and negatives, with a shared 8-mer (sub)sequence to the training peptides. In the case of the YFV set, the peptides from the digested viral proteome (8 to 14-mers) with an exact match to peptides in the training sets of any of the two models were discarded. Finally, the IEDB set consisted of 429 epitopes (covering 33 different HLAs) while the YFV set consisted of 64 epitopes (spanning 29 different HLAs). To compare the method developed in this work with NetMHCpan-4.1 on a fair basis, we used a reduced version of NetMHCpan-4.1 to perform this benchmark, consisting of an ensemble of 50 networks (corresponding to 5 random seed initializations instead of the original 10 random seeds).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3.9"><title>Model evaluation: score normalization</title><p id="p0410">HLA annotation for MA datasets is based on which HLA molecule expressed in a given cell line has the highest prediction score for a given ligand.

The use of such percentile normalized prediction scores makes the model output more interpretable and makes relative comparison across HLA molecules fairer. To allow using the same dataset for the percentile calculation for all models, these random peptides were taken from the proteome of genome assembly GRCh38.p12 and were given gene expression values from the HPA reference dataset.</p><p id="p0415">In relation to this last point, we investigated if the choice of this gene expression reference for the random peptides could have an impact on the predictive power of the trained models. Gene expression values of the training datasets B-D were recalibrated using the HPA dataset as a reference.

Moreover, the PPV (Positive Predictive Value) was calculated as the fraction of peptides in the top N&#x02217;0.95 predictions that were true positives, where N is the number of ligands assigned to a given HLA/cell line.

To calculate the F-rank, the source protein of a given epitope is digested in all possible 8 to 14-mer peptides. Next, all peptides are predicted for the given HLA, and the F-rank value is calculated as the ratio of the number of peptides with a prediction score higher than the epitope divided by the number of peptides contained within the source protein. The lower the F-rank value, the better the prediction for the epitope. An F-rank of 0 implies that the epitope is the peptide with highest prediction score within the source protein. The F-rank value can also be interpreted as the percentage of false positives or peptides with a prediction score higher than the actual positive - the epitope.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3.11"><title>Sequence logos</title><p id="p0440">Sequence binding motifs were visualized as logo plots using the software Seg2Logo (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Thomsen and Nielsen, 2012</xref>).

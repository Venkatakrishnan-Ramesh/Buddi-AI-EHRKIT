Almost the entire world has been affected by this pandemic one way or another. Health Care Providers (HCP) are working tirelessly to prevent, protect, care, treat, and rehabilitate countless patients each day across the globe. On the other hand, the health care workers (HCWs) also suffered from various other problems including acquiring the infection, increased mental stress, burnout, fatigue, and psychological issues.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In this context, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on trainees&#x02019; education (medical students and residents) are not widely assessed and reported. Without a doubt, the effects of the pandemic have had both negative and positive impacts on medical education.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Therefore, this article will highlight various challenges as well as a few distinct advantages for medical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>On the positive side, this catastrophic pandemic provided several unique learning opportunities for the trainees. First, the pandemic has enabled students to learn <italic toggle="yes">enhanced adaptability and flexibility</italic> through the rapid change in learning behavior and pattern as a result of the changing resources and needs.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This is an important domain of learning and imparts training for multiple practical and theoretical modules including doffing and donning, hand washing methods, social distancing, various surgical/anesthetic/hospital-specific protocols, testing protocols, and communication skills.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Second, trainees had the <italic toggle="yes">great (even lifetime) opportunity</italic> to learn about the COVID-19 disease and related consequences. Third, they also learned to imbibe <italic toggle="yes">new communication tools</italic> including Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and others.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] These methods assist in the day-to-day teachings, rounds, and patient assessments. In a survey-based study from South Korea, a majority of medical students were satisfied by online teaching modules, and even more than 80% of the students expressed interest to continue with online learning after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] In addition, in response to the stressors posed by the pandemic, a greater emphasis on mental health awareness and interventions has been placed by faculties. Some of these interventions include stress management sessions for students, tailored learning plans to assist with achieving educational checkpoints, and personal portfolio programs to promote personal goal setting.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Finally, <italic toggle="yes">managing a public health crisis</italic> at all levels is the greatest learning and education experience for the trainees.</p><p>On the other hand, the negative consequences of this pandemic outweigh the positive aspects and include adverse physical, social, emotional, and psychological impacts on trainees. Medical students, for example, were faced with reduced exposure to clinical settings and faculties had to balance between the students&#x02019; safety while ensuring that adequate hospital clinical exposure was obtained.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Nevertheless, trainees experienced significant interruptions and modulations in classic classroom teachings, bedside teachings, electives, call scheduling, in-person group learning, as well as in many supplementary campus resources.[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In addition, faculties had to aid students to navigate through the uncertainty and stress around examinations and credit evaluations as well as the potential impact of the closure on future residency or job applications.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Furthermore, a great deal of stress resulted from residency changes such as restricting the number of applications allowed per applicant, delaying residency programs&#x02019; access to applicant profiles, and replacing visiting internships with virtual sessions.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Due to a lack of research resources and recruitment issues amid the COVID-19 pandemic, various research projects (BSc med, resident projects, fellows projects, etc.) were affected and delayed.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Undoubtedly, the learning experience of trainees involving research methodology, patient interactions, and follow-ups were partly or completely affected. In the recent survey (conducted in India with a response rate of 46.6%) to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on post-graduate medical teaching, research, and mental stress, a few important concerns were highlighted.[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] These include experiencing substantial mental stress due to the inability to complete the thesis (research project) on time as well as the probable extension of the residency period, risks of contracting infection, sleep disturbances, and uncertainty related to future jobs. Interestingly, this survey also explored the possible ways to manage research project submissions as part of residency requirements and suggested to incorporate a few changes: extending the submission date, reduction in the number of study participants, and change in the research topic. It is important to acknowledge that the magnitude of the current problem being faced by trainees requires extensive feedback from all levels of teaching hospitals including students, teachers, administrators, and other health care providers. In addition, the economical aspects of trainees&#x02019; education in different parts of the world also require active support from the political and the local administrations.</p><p>In conclusion, various aspects of trainees&#x02019; education are being affected during this pandemic; however, there is an urgent need to incorporate various strategies into teaching hospitals so that the overall competency, skills, and knowledge of trainees would not be compromised.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author">

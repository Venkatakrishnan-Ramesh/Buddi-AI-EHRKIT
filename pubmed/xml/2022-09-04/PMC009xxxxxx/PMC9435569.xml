Diffuse melanocytic lesions that do not form macroscopic masses are termed melanocytosis if they are benign or melanomatosis if they are malignant.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>These tumors may present significant diagnostic difficulties from clinical, radiological, and pathologic standpoints for several reasons. First, these tumors may mimic other lesions radiologically, such as meningioma, ependymoma, or schwannoma, and any melanotic lesion histologically, from melanocytosis to melanotic schwannoma and melanoma. Second, separation of these tumors into either benign or malignant categories based on histological findings alone may be difficult, especially in biopsy specimens with scant diagnostic material. Finally, determining whether these tumors truly represent primary CNS tumors as opposed to metastatic lesions, which are far more common, is challenging because it is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion. This distinction is important, however, because of differences in prognosis and treatment modalities between the two tumors.</p><p>We report the case of a 41-year-old man with primary meningeal melanomatosis masquerading as neurofibromatosis type 2. This case illustrates the above-mentioned clinical, radiological, and pathological diagnostic difficulties that may arise when evaluating these neoplasms. In addition, we review the recent literature concerning primary meningeal melanocytic neoplasms with a focus on diagnosis, classification, and recently described molecular features.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Illustrative Case</title><p>We report the case of a 41-year-old man with no significant past medical history who presented with a 6-month history of headaches and hearing loss and back pain with bilateral leg tingling. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and spine showed bilateral enhancing masses in the internal auditory canals, most consistent with bilateral vestibular schwannomas. In this context, an additional extraaxial contrast-enhancing lesion in the right Sylvian fissure adjacent to the right inferior frontal lobe (2.0 &#x000d7; 1.9 &#x000d7; 1.8 cm) and an extraaxial contrast-enhancing lesion in the anterior aspect of the right middle cranial fossa (1.9 &#x000d7; 1.6 &#x000d7; 1.8 cm) were thought to be most consistent with meningiomas. In the spine, there was a 2.8 &#x000d7; 1.0 &#x000d7; 2.7-cm cystic and solid intramedullary expansile lesion at the level of C6 and C7, with the solid component demonstrating homogenous enhancement, which was thought to be an ependymoma (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). In addition, there were multiple small intradural extramedullary enhancing lesions scattered throughout the spinal canal, which were thought to be peripheral nerve sheath tumors and/or meningiomas.

These melanocytes originate from neural crest cells, which differentiate into melanoblasts that migrate to mucosal surfaces, such as the aerodigestive and urogenital tracts, and to the inner ear, the uvea and leptomeninges during embryonic development.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The CNS resident melanocytes differ from cutaneous melanocytes, sharing similarities with those of the uveal tract. This finding is further supported by the molecular similarities of both benign and malignant tumors that they give rise to.</p><p>Primary leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms can be broadly categorized as localized and diffuse. According to the 2016 edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the CNS, localized neoplasms may be designated as melanocytomas if they are benign or melanomas if they are malignant. Intermediate-grade lesions are also designated as melanocytomas. Diffuse lesions in the subarachnoid space that do not form macroscopic masses are termed melanocytosis and are regarded as benign. On histology, meningeal melanocytomas lack cytological atypia and mitosis. The term meningeal melanomatosis is used when primary CNS melanoma arises from and spreads throughout the subarachnoid and Virchow-Robin spaces and invades the CNS.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Meningeal Melanocytoma</title><p>Melanocytomas are slow-growing, localized tumors with a peak incidence in the fifth decade of life with a slight female predominance (1.5:1). They most frequently arise in the cervical and thoracic spinal regions, the posterior cranial fossa, and Meckel&#x02019;s cave, likely because of the high density of melanocytes in these areas. In the spine, they are usually intradural and extramedullary and may be either dural based or associated with nerve roots or spinal foramina. Rarely, they may be intramedullary or paraspinal.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Clinically, they usually present with compressive symptoms, with focal neurological signs depending on the tumor location. On MRI, the unique paramagnetic properties of melanin cause them to appear iso- to hyperintense on T1-weighted images and iso- or hypointense on T2-weighted images, with homogenous enhancement on postcontrast images.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Macroscopically, these lesions may be black, reddish-brown, or blue in color, or they may be nonpigmented. Histological examination reveals them to be composed of well-differentiated spindle or ovoid melanocytes with minimal cytological atypia and varying amounts of cytoplasmic melanin, growing as tight nests or sheets. The nuclei are bean-shaped, and longitudinal grooves and micronucleoli may be appreciated. Importantly, these lesions should exhibit minimal to no mitotic activity (on average &#x0003c;1 mitosis per 10 high power fields), and the Ki-67 proliferative index is usually &#x0003c;1%&#x02013;2%. Invasion of surrounding structures is not seen. The 2016 edition of the WHO classification of CNS tumors suggests that melanocytic tumors with bland cytological features, such as those of melanocytoma, but showing CNS invasion or elevated mitotic activity should be classified as intermediate-grade melanocytic neoplasms.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Completely excised melanocytomas have a good prognosis, although local recurrence can occur with incomplete excision.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Because of the low frequency of reported cases, the behavior of intermediate-grade lesions cannot be reliably predicted.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Rarely, melanocytomas with aggressive behavior and malignant transformation have been reported.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Meningeal Melanoma</title><p>Meningeal melanomas are the malignant counterpart to meningeal melanocytomas. They have an annual incidence of 0.5 per 10 million and may occur at any age, with a peak in the fifth decade of life. There is a slight male to female predominance. Meningeal melanoma may occur anywhere along the neuraxis, with a predilection for the spinal cord and posterior fossa.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>Like melanocytomas, they present with focal neurological symptoms depending on the tumor location. Imaging findings are similar to those of melanocytomas, although they may have T2 hyperintensity in the adjacent brain or spinal cord, which is indicative of vasogenic edema generated by rapid tumor growth.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Histologically, these tumors resemble melanomas from other sites. The cells may be anaplastic, either epithelioid or spindled, and form fascicles, sheets, and nests with varying degrees of cytoplasmic melanin pigment. In some cases, large bizarre cells may be present with significant pleomorphism and large nucleoli. Other cases may be less pleomorphic. Typical and atypical mitotic figures are numerous, and there is often unequivocal invasion of the CNS parenchyma and coagulative necrosis.</p><p>The prognosis of primary meningeal melanoma is better than that of melanoma metastatic to leptomeninges, especially in the case of localized lesions in which complete resection is possible.</p><p>The main differential diagnosis of meningeal melanoma is metastatic melanoma, particularly from regressed or nonvisible lesions, such as acral melanoma, melanomas of the nail bed, or mucosal surfaces. A diagnosis of metastatic melanoma should be excluded by careful review of a patient&#x02019;s history, detailed physical examination, and ophthalmic evaluation and reexamination of any previously excised skin lesions. Another important entity to consider in the differential diagnosis of melanocytic neoplasms is the melanotic schwannoma. This is a variant of schwannoma composed of Schwann cells with intracytoplasmic melanosomes, which cause them to express melanocytic markers. These lesions may exhibit cytological atypia with hyperchromasia and macronucleoli and may be difficult to differentiate from melanocytic tumors. Reticulin staining or immunohistochemistry for basement membrane proteins (such as collagen IV) may be useful because staining will be nested in melanocytomas, whereas schwannomas tend to demonstrate pericellular staining. Other uncommon entities to consider in the differential diagnosis of melanocytic neoplasms include melanotic medulloblastoma, melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy, pigmented glial or ependymal and choroid plexus tumors, teratomas, and paragangliomas.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Rarely, meningiomas can have entrapped pigmented dendritic melanocytes and could mimic melanocytoma.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Diffuse Melanocytic Lesions</title><p>Melanocytosis and melanomatosis are characterized by diffuse proliferation of benign or malignant melanocytes, respectively, along the leptomeninges, the latter exhibiting superficial invasion of the CNS parenchyma. Both occur primarily in children and are strongly linked to neurocutaneous melanosis, a rare phakomatosis characterized by the presence of large and/or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi of the skin with primary melanocytic lesions of the CNS.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Melanocytosis may remain asymptomatic; however, the prognosis is poor once symptoms develop, even in the absence of malignant transformation. Symptoms may be secondary to hydrocephalus or local effects on CNS parenchyma, with neuropsychiatric symptoms and bowel, bladder, sensory, and motor dysfunction being most common. Melanomatosis, on the other hand, is a highly aggressive disease with a high mortality.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Molecular Features</title><p>Primary leptomeningeal melanocytic neoplasms have a molecular profile that is distinct from cutaneous melanomas and more closely resembles that of uveal melanomas and blue nevi.

These mutations are thought to occur before melanocytic migration as postzygotic somatic mutations. Supporting this notion, in the aforementioned series, one of the melanocytic tumors with an <italic toggle="yes">SF3B1</italic> mutation was from a patient with neurocutaneous melanosis who also harbored an <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic> mutation. The melanocytic skin nevus from the same patient was found to harbor the same <italic toggle="yes">NRAS</italic> mutation; however, it did not have the <italic toggle="yes">SF3B1</italic> mutation.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The molecular similarities between primary CNS melanocytic neoplasms, uveal melanoma, and blue nevi are striking because these neoplasms all derive from nonepithelial melanocytes (blue nevi being intradermal).<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>In summary, primary CNS melanocytic neoplasms represent a rare group of neoplasms, ranging from benign to malignant tumors. They may present as localized mass lesions or as diffuse proliferations involving leptomeninges, the latter of which is often associated with neurocutaneous melanosis syndrome. The diagnosis of these tumors can be challenging, as illustrated by this case, and requires integration of clinical and radiographic findings with histological appearance and molecular studies. This approach is especially required to determine whether the lesion represents a primary CNS lesion versus a metastatic melanoma, an important distinction because they differ both in prognosis and management. From a molecular standpoint, meningeal melanocytic lesions more closely resemble those of the uveal tract; however, further studies are required to determine the prognostic significance of <italic toggle="yes">SF3B1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">EIF1AX</italic> mutations as well as the prognosis of <italic toggle="yes">BAP1</italic> inactivating mutations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Disclosures</title><p>The authors report no conflict of interest concerning the materials or methods used in this study or the findings specified in this paper.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conception and design: Lang-Orsini, Wu, Madan, Arkun.

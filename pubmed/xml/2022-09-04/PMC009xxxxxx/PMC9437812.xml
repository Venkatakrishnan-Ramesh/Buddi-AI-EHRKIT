The study adopts a hybrid approach combining bibliometric and content analysis to reveal the current research trend of Islamic FinTech research. Using the Scopus database, we retrieve 85 documents and analyze them using RStudio and VOSviewer. The content analysis categorizes the research output in Islamic FinTech into four distinct streams. The study finds potential for cointegrating FinTech into Islamic finance to benefit the unbanked and small-medium-size businesses, the adoption of FinTech in Islamic finance will also help the government improve financial inclusion, conquer financial crises, such as COVID-19, and achieve SDGs for a sustainable nation. However, the lack of legal regulation and the lower financial literacy becomes the primary obstacle to the development of FinTech in Islamic finance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Islamic FinTech; Crowdfunding; Payments; Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; P2P lending.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Islamic FinTech</kwd><kwd>Crowdfunding</kwd><kwd>Payments</kwd><kwd>Blockchain</kwd><kwd>Cryptocurrency</kwd><kwd>P2P lending</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">FinTech (<italic>Financial Technology</italic>) is an emerging field within finance. It refers to the use of technology to enable incremental or drastic improvements in financial services (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Alshater and Othman, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib146" ref-type="bibr">Thakor, 2020</xref>). The <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Financial Stability Board (2019)</xref> defines FinTech as &#x0201c;Technologically enabled financial innovation that could result in new business models, applications, processes, or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services&#x0201d;. Islamic FinTech is no different else than being compliant with <italic>shariah</italic> and a special focus on Islamic compliant institutions or Islamic countries (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Alshater and Othman, 2020</xref>). The term &#x0201c;Islamic&#x0201d; stands to differentiate between conventional and <italic>shariah-compliant</italic> FinTech operators. This differentiation is rational due to the many differences in FinTech business models between the two systems. For example, profit interest-based P2P lending, one of the most thriving business models in FinTech, is fundamentally rejected in the Islamic finance system due to (<italic>riba</italic>) being a primary prohibition in the system.</p><p id="p0015">As Islamic Finance is now a $3 trillion industry with growing demand, this puts a context of what Islamic FinTech might witness soon, given the industry is already on the rise (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Islamic Finance Development Report, 2019</xref>). Thus, studying the emerging industry dynamics becomes more critical as FinTech aims are in line with the primary <italic>shariah</italic> objectives for financial transactions. According to <xref rid="bib146" ref-type="bibr">Thakor (2020)</xref>, FinTech aims to unveil cheaper ways to overcome financial contracting frictions and lower the cost of financial services to improve consumer welfare; in a similar vein, D. K. C. <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Teo (2015)</xref> defined FinTech's five principles: low-profit margin, light asset, expandability, innovation, and easy compliance, which all are in line with <italic>shariah</italic> principles.</p><p id="p0020">Fintech history starts as early as 1866, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Consumer International (2017)</xref> divided the FinTech developmental period into three phases. The first phase between 1866 to 1967 was marked by trans-Atlantic cable and telegraph as a means of financial communications. Between 1967 and 2008, the second phase saw the emergence of online banking and ATMs where financial institutions started incorporating information technology into financial products and services. The third phase, from 2008 onwards, is marked by the use of high-tech by newer entrants with different characteristics, creating a new competitive landscape for financial institutions. <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Palmi&#x000e9; et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref> state that the emergence represented an industry-wide system-level change that led to the inception of new actors and the convergence of competencies. This intensive rise of FinTech at the industry level, especially in major economies such as the US, UK, China, and Germany, motivated researchers to investigate FinTech related topics from different dimensions. From the conventional perspective, the literature is growing at a fast pace, so do various types of reviews (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Al-Sartawi et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Li and Xu, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">Sangwan et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib144" ref-type="bibr">Suryono et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib149" ref-type="bibr">Utami et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>), in contrast from Islamic perspective the pace is much slower, which motivated us to conduct this study, as few reviews tried to catch up the progress including non-directly related topics e.g (<xref rid="bib125" ref-type="bibr">Rabbani et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Our study is more comprehensive in nature and scope as it focuses on reviewing all relevant and published articles tackling compliant innovative technological applications concentrating on Islamic financial institutions.</p><p id="p0025">This study makes several contributions to the existing literature. (1) It is the first study to illustrate the basic characteristics of publications in the Islamic FinTech domain, including the annual progress, the most influential articles, and keywords co-occurrence, beside the development of the research streams over the years. (2) Further, the study does a comprehensive overview of the research publications in Islamic FinTech and each category under it. (3) The study adopts a hybrid method combining bibliometric methods and content analysis to review 85 studies from 2017&#x02013;2022 (4) Finally, it provides an overview of the current special environment of Islamic FinTech and the challenges faced by besides providing suggested future research directions.</p><p id="p0030">The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Bibliometric is a quantitative analysis that enables the researchers to discover the emerging trend of collaboration networks and identify the intellectual structure of a certain field of study (<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Donthu et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). This method is useful for mapping the Islamic FinTech research based on statistical analysis. Moreover, this study uses content analysis and SLR as it allows the researcher to categorize the literature, analyze the gaps in existing studies, and offer recommendations for the research topic (<xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">Paul and Criado, 2020</xref>). The SLR used is based explicitly on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a well-suited method to synthesize the research finding from the most impactful selected studies in this research field. We follow the PRISMA guideline proposed by <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">Moher et&#x000a0;al. (2009)</xref> who divided PRISMA into four main steps: identification, screening, eligibility assessment, and identification of the findings. This method assure transparency on how the data is collected and the final number of papers included for review. We employ RStudio software to achieve the following research objectives (RO1.1 and RO1.2), whereas (RO1.3 and RO2) are addressed using VOSviewer software. Following are the outlined objectives:<statement id="enun1"><label>RO1</label><p id="p0040">To evaluate the current publication trend of Islamic FinTech.</p><p id="p0045">as answers to RO1 are rather quantitative in nature, hence, further sub objectives are categorized as follow:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><p id="p0050">RO1.1.

(2020)</xref> state that the Scopus database contains a greater number of Islamic finance research than other databases such as Web of Science, while it also indexes more well-validated studies than those solely appearing on Google Scholar, EBSCO, or ProQuest. Moreover, several previous review studies on Islamic economics, banking, and finance, primarily relied on Scopus e. g <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">Paltrinieri et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref>, M.

The vast development of Islamic FinTech literature which spans through multiple disciplines, including technology and religion, resulted in challenges in identifying the right keywords. As <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Shin (2018)</xref> described, there are six business models of FinTech, including lending, capital market, insurance services, wealth management, payment, and crowdfunding. In detail, <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Laidroo et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> identified seven activities of FinTech, including, (1) Payment activity refers to the online and mobile payment model; (2) Deposit and lending activity which covers the crowdfunding model, peer-to-peer lending, microlending, and consumer financing model; (3) Investment management activity which covers Robo-advice, social trading, and automated advice model; (4) Distributed ledger technology activity which covers digital currency and blockchain model; (5) Banking infrastructure activity covering user interface and open banking model; (6) Analytics activity; and (7) Insurance.</p><p id="p0090">Given the consideration of previous explanation, the selected keywords in this study were identified by conducting a pre-simulation to assure that the keywords cover most of the existing studies related to Islamic FinTech. Moreover, the selection of keywords also referred to previous scientometric research by various researchers who tried to cluster the knowledge in this area, for example, <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref>, suggested including the words P2P, crowdfunding, blockchain, cryptocurrency, robo-advisors, and mobile payment, as they are related to FinTech business model.</p><p id="p0095">Guided by the previous literature, therefore, the study applied several important search keywords including, &#x0201c;Fintech&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Financial Technologies&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Financial Technology&#x0201d; &#x0201c;finance technology&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Islamic Fintech&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Blockchain&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Digital Finance&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;P2P&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;P2P Lending&#x02019; OR &#x0201c;Credit Scoring&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Robo Advisor&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Insurenctech&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Smart Contract&#x02217;&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Bitcoin&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Crowdfunding&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Crypto&#x02217; OR &#x0201c;Financial Inclusion&#x0201d; in the Article Title, Abstract, Keyword. These keywords were further combined with another set of keywords, namely. &#x0201c;Islam&#x02217;&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;<italic>Shariah</italic>&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Shari'ah&#x0201d; to represent Islamic FinTech. In result, at the first stage of data curation, we obtain 265 documents. Moreover, as this study strive to investigate the existing studies on FinTech within the Islamic view, we conducted another data search using &#x0201c;Financial Inclusion&#x0201d; in the Article Title, Abstract, Keyword, followed by two search field by using &#x0201c;Islam&#x02217;&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;<italic>Shariah</italic>&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;Shari'ah&#x0201d;, AND followed by &#x0201c;<italic>fintech&#x0201d;</italic> OR &#x0201c;<italic>finance technology</italic>&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;<italic>financial technologies</italic>&#x0201d; OR &#x0201c;<italic>digital finance</italic>&#x0201d; in the Article Title, Abstract, Keyword, to collect related articles. Thus, at the second stage of data curation, we obtained 11 documents. The data of this study retrieved the data from the Scopus database in February 2022 and resulted in 276 documents.</p><p id="p0100">The second step is data screening. The selected articles from the previous step are filtered based on specific criteria described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>. Hence, 159 out of 276 documents were excluded as it does not satisfy our screening criteria; this step leaves 117 potentially relevant studies. Previous SLR studies on Islamic banking and finance, such as <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Narayan and Phan (2019)</xref>, <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Khan et&#x000a0;al.

The criterion in this step refers to the article's content where we followed <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Lundberg et&#x000a0;al. (2006)</xref> in hiding the article's identity suggestion, including journals and authors' names, to avoid subjectivity in manual refinement, also using the following inclusion criterion: (1) Studies related to Islamic FinTech; (2) Studies discussing the role and impact of Islamic FinTech in business, Islamic economics, philanthropy, banking, stock market, and halal industry; and (3) Studies investigate one of the business models of Islamic FinTech. While the exclusion criterion is: (1) Studies discuss other topics as the study's objectives, while Islamic FinTech has a small part of the study; and (2) Studies that did not offer substantial insights into Islamic FinTech. The full-text analysis has excluded 32 articles from 117, leaving 85 articles for the final evaluation.</p><p id="p0110">The final step is categorizing and summarizing literature findings. In this step, we extracted the substantial findings of previous studies and presented them in tables and discuss them.

It also illustrates that the country's collaboration network was divided into five clusters. Malaysia was cited as the centre of collaboration with the United States, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Japan, and Finland's research partnership in the green cluster. This result implies that these countries have published a similar topic of discussion on Islamic FinTech. Furthermore, the short distance nodes between Malaysia United Arab Emirates (UAE) (in the cluster red) indicated that these countries tend to conduct joint research partnerships. Malaysia and the United Kingdom are also present the closer nodes. Thus, the collaboration network between these two countries is of relative strength.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Collaboration network map of countries.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0020">Figure&#x000a0;3</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p><p id="p0140">Moreover, the red cluster consists of eight countries with similar topic interests, namely, France, India, Oman, Palestine, Luxemburg, Russian Federation, and UAE. Furthermore, Australia, China, Pakistan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam were found in cluster blue. These countries have a strong connection with Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Italy as their research partners. Besides, in the yellow cluster, Canada, Greece, Italy, Malta, and Morocco tend to have a common research topic. Finally, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Tunisia, and Bahrain were found in the purple cluster. In conclusion, research related to FinTech and the Islamic finance industry has spread globally and attracted researchers from various countries, including non-Muslim majority countries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Research main theme</title><p id="p0145">The most discussed topics in Islamic FinTech research are presented using keyword co-occurrence analysis.

M. <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">Shaikh et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>); customer's satisfaction (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Baber, 2019</xref>); customer's retention (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Baber, 2020b</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">2020c</xref>); and customer's trust (M. <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ali et&#x000a0;al., 2021a</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ali et&#x000a0;al., 2021b</xref>). FinTech in Islamic finance institutions provides four types of services: payments, crowdfunding, advisory, financing, and compliance (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Baber, 2020b</xref>). Several key factors are affecting customers' intention to use Islamic FinTech based on previous studies:</p><p id="p0175">First, <italic>shariah</italic> compliance. There is still debate amongst the scholars and practitioners about whether religiosity drives the customers to use Islamic banking, a study by <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Baber (2020b)</xref> and <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Marzuki and Nurdin (2020)</xref> proved that Islamic banking customers have a strong concern toward <italic>shariah</italic>-compliance of FinTech products. Moreover, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Baber (2019)</xref> correctly argues that <italic>shariah</italic>-compliance of FinTech services becomes a crucial factor in customer satisfaction. Thus, to maintain the customer's loyalty and satisfaction, the quality and performance of Islamic banking, specifically mobile banking, should improve immensely. Hence, the results of these studies call attention to enhancing the roles of the <italic>shariah</italic> supervisory board in ensuring the services meet Islamic principles.</p><p id="p0180">Second, is the ease of use. An interesting study by <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Darmansyah et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref> concludes that the technology acceptance model becomes the most significant factor influencing customers&#x02019; intention in using FinTech, particularly in P2P services. In detail, I. M. <xref rid="bib139" ref-type="bibr">Shaikh et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref> ascertained that perceived ease of use and usefulness play an important role in shaping customer intention. In the same vein, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Baber (2019)</xref> also argued that apps design has massively increased customer satisfaction in using Islamic FinTech. Besides, M. <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ali et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> pointed out that the secure Islamic FinTech apps and operations increase customer trust in accessing Islamic FinTech. Hence, the key implication drawn from these studies is the importance of user experience in using Islamic FinTech. Thus, FinTech providers should pay more attention to improving FinTech apps and websites quality by considering the customer needs and prevailing innovations.</p><p id="p0185">Third, is customer knowledge. <xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">Oladapo et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> put forth that customers' knowledge of Islamic FinTech is significantly related to the increasing customer's intention to utilise FinTech. Moreover, the result is also supported by <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Baber (2020c)</xref>, who assured that providing adequate information regarding Islamic principles will enhance the customer's satisfaction. These studies clarify that banking practitioners and operators should regularly attend training, seminars, and conferences to update their capacity to offer customers comprehensive knowledge related to FinTech.</p><p id="p0190"><italic>The second sub-stream addressed Islamic FinTech development and its impact on Islamic finance institutions.</italic><xref rid="bib125" ref-type="bibr">Rabbani et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref> conducted a systematic literature review to synthesize Islamic fintech; they found that three dominant topics have been widely discussed: Islamic FinTech opportunity and challenges, cryptocurrency/blockchain <italic>shariah</italic> compliance, and the law/regulation aspect of fintech innovations. this study underlined that FinTech offers more cost-effective financial services than traditional finance and banking. Based on a country level <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">Muryanto et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> stated that Indonesia, as the largest Muslim population country, has massive potential to elevate the economic growth by utilizing Islamic FinTech. Moreover, this study also describes several challenges in Islamic FinTech's development, including weak regulation, inefficient permit procedures, and a higher rate of illegal FinTech practices. Another study <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Almulla and Aljughaiman (2021)</xref> documented that the massive growth of FinTech firms negatively affects conventional and Islamic banks' performance, measured by the declining ROA and ROE rates. These studies' findings illustrate the possibility of financial institutions shifting from banking to FinTech firms, highlighting disruptive technology's negative impact on traditional financial institutions.</p><p id="p0195">On the other hand, numerous studies have investigated FinTech practices adoption's impact on Islamic finance institutions' performance, specifically Islamic banks and microfinance institutions. Mustafa Raza <xref rid="bib124" ref-type="bibr">Rabbani and Khan (2020)</xref> underlined that FinTech could significantly decrease the operational cost of Islamic banking, which will allow it to offer more competitive products. Moreover, <xref rid="bib138" ref-type="bibr">Selim (2020)</xref> ascertained that implementing FinTech in foreign currency transactions by Islamic banks would increase their market share. In return, Islamic banking can provide non-interest rate transactions in real-time and without <italic>riba</italic>. Moreover, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Altwijry et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> conducted an interesting discussion regarding the <italic>shariah-based</italic> FinTech money creation. This study emphasized the validity and credibility of Islamic banking to adopt FinTech in their services, answering a debate about whether Islamic banking is necessarily creating money to support their business. This study underlines that Islamic bank should fully enhance their ability to adapt <italic>Shar&#x0012b;ah-compliant</italic> FinTech.</p><p id="p0200">Moreover, in the case of Islamic microfinance, S. A. <xref rid="bib140" ref-type="bibr">Shaikh (2021)</xref> explained that FinTech would enable Islamic microfinance to obtain a broader range of fund providers, increase transparency, decline the transaction cost, support the customer's monitoring process, and increase the accuracy in screening criteria. However, research by X. <xref rid="bib153" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> reported that the Islamic bank's investment in FinTech has not yet been effective; this indicates that there are still areas that require improvement. The result of this study is also supported by <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Nastiti and Kasri (2019)</xref>, who declared that the policy-maker should make a strenuous effort to establish a supportive investment environment for an Islamic bank to adopt FinTech. In short, the adoption of FinTech will elevate the development and efficiency of Islamic financial institutions, which will lead to the improvement of Islamic finance institutions' role in economic growth. Hence, a solid collaboration amongst the stakeholder is crucial.</p><p id="p0205">Despite the massive growth of Islamic FinTech, one of the biggest obstacles in its way is the lack of specific legal law from policymakers. <xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">Nurhasanah and Rahmatullah (2020)</xref> from Indonesia revealed that the Islamic FinTech providers are still behind in terms of regulation, law, and operational rules compared with their conventional counterparts. The uncertainty of the legal law of Islamic FinTech has also resulted in the weak security of customers' data and the increasing number of illegal FinTech. Moreover, the ineffective role of <italic>shariah</italic> supervisors as regulating authorities has also become the primary reason that hinders the growth of FinTech's start-up (Ilyas et&#x000a0;al., 2020; <xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">Tajudin et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). In the Malaysian case, the government has set a specific target to digitalize the financial industry, which breaks down to the liberation of specific areas, including insurance, trading assistance, Robo-advisory, and P2P lending. By analyzing the development of FinTech start-ups in Malaysia and Finland, this study tells us that special committees and legal laws are required to drive Islamic FinTech development. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> further summarizes the prior literature in this stream.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Financial technology.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0040">Table&#x000a0;2</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Paper Info</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Methodology</th><th>Results</th><th>Dropout</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="5">Customer Perception on Islamic FinTech</td></tr><tr><td>(<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Baber, 2020b</xref>)</td><td>This paper investigates the impact of FinTech applications and crowdfunding on customer retention in Islamic banking.</td><td>A quantitative approach based on structured questionnaires.</td><td>&#x02217; Islamic FinTech provide four types of services, namely, payments, advisory, finance, and compliance.<break/>&#x02217; The finance application of FinTech does not have a significant impact in forming customer satisfaction.<break/>&#x02217; Crowdfunding services have massively increased due to attracting start-up who provide new ways of raising funds.</td><td>The empirical study sample is based on Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates; thus, the result of this study cannot be generalized.</td></tr><tr><td>(<xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Marzuki and Nurdin, 2020</xref>)</td><td>This paper examines the influencing factors of customers to use Islamic FinTech services.</td><td>A quantitative approach based on structured questionnaires</td><td>&#x02217; <italic>Shariah</italic>-compliant is the most important factor in adopting Islamic FinTech.<break/>&#x02217; Social environment has less impact in attracting the customer's intention to use Islamic FinTech products.</td><td>This study was specifically conducted in Indonesia.

Islamic finance does not consider money as a subject matter of trade but as a medium of exchange.

In this regard, <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Oziev and Yandie (2018)</xref> critically analyzed bitcoin's nature and features and identified no contradiction of bitcoin with Islamic laws.

S. <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Abubakar et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). First, all the products within the nomenclature of cryptocurrency are derived from financial engineering without being backed by real economic assets; thus, it does not fit within Islamic finance. Islamic finance proposes financial intermediation based on real tangible assets, which naturally strengthen the economy and make it more resilient during economic turmoil. Secondly, Islamic finance does not allow transactions based on interest and speculation (M. K. <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Also, recent studies show that cryptocurrencies are inefficient (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Bariviera, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">Nadarajah and Chu, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">Tiwari et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>), highly volatile and speculative (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Cheah and Fry, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Elsayed et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Katsiampa, 2017</xref>), very sensitive to macroeconomic factors (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Demir et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; P. <xref rid="bib152" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), and lacks flexibility and acceptability (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Hanif, 2020</xref>), it cannot be used as a medium of exchange on the ground because of its speculative nature (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Baur et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Thirdly, cryptocurrencies are also used in illegal activities such as money laundering and purchasing drugs and weapons (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Hammad, 2018</xref>). Cryptocurrencies are type of digital currencies that are generally not asset-backed or issued by any central bank, so it doesn't have the same features of fiat money. Lastly and very importantly, due to the aforementioned factors, cryptocurrencies are not directly backed by any country or regulatory body, unlike fiat money which has implications for monetary policy. If central bank money no longer defines the unit of account for most economic activities and if crypto assets instead provide those units of account, the central bank's monetary policy becomes irrelevant. Moreover, most developing countries are heavily dependent on foreign currency reserves to meet their fiscal deficit and debt obligation. This provides an analogy to cryptocurrency and may disconnect the monetary policy in local currency from the local economy. This dilemma will remain in developing countries if a global digital currency is not introduced.</p><p id="p0225"><xref rid="bib143" ref-type="bibr">Siswantoro et&#x000a0;al.

A. <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ahmed (2021)</xref> analysis the sensitivity of the Islamic stock market towards the dynamic volatility of bitcoin in developed and emerging markets and found a similar behavior of Islamic stock in two types of markets during normal, bear, and bull markets states. Similarly, <xref rid="bib128" ref-type="bibr">Rehman et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref> studies the risk dependence structure of bitcoin along with the Islamic equity market for the period of 2010&#x02013;2018 and found that the value at risk of bitcoin is higher than those of Islamic equity markets, which naturally implies that investors from cryptocurrency market should add Islamic equity funds to reduce the overall risk of their portfolio. Besides, <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Mensi et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref> analyzed bitcoins' co-movement and risk structure with the Islamic equity and bond market and provided mixed results. They find strong co-movement of bitcoin in the same direction at a lower frequency with Islamic equity and bond, suggesting lower (higher) diversification benefits for the long run (short-run) investors. Lastly, empirical evidence during the policy uncertainty period, <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Hasan et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> portrayed the positive and significant relationship between cryptocurrency policy uncertainty towards gold, <italic>Sukuk</italic>, and the DJ Islamic index return, which indicates the existence of diversification benefit between those assets during bearish, normal, and bullish market period. Besides, this study also mentioned that the existence of <italic>shariah</italic> screening criteria on <italic>Sukuk</italic> and the DJ Islamic index improves the resistance of Islamic investment instruments towards uncertainty and the economic meltdown period.</p><p id="p0245">Few studies have also assessed the differences between Islamic and conventional cryptocurrencies. The <italic>shariah</italic> compliance of bitcoin and cryptocurrency still has become a debate amongst Islamic scholars and stakeholders (M. K. <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Hassan, Karim, et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Aloui et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> found that Islamic cryptocurrencies positively correlate with yellow metal. However, this relationship is negative and weak for conventional cryptocurrencies. Likewise, <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Lahmiri &#x00026; Bekiros (2019)</xref> reported that green and Islamic cryptocurrencies showed anti-persistence in their returns while the volume, prices, and volatility exhibit a higher pertinence dynamic than its counterpart. During economic meltdown due to COVID-19 (<xref rid="bib113" ref-type="bibr">Nugroho, 2021</xref>), Islamic gold-backed cryptocurrency (GC-gold) has shown better performance than conventional GC-gold, which is indicated by the resistance of Islamic GC-gold to COVID-19's impact. Moreover, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Chkili et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> found that bitcoin provides a safer asset for investors during economic downturns than Islamic stock. Thus, it is suggested that investors add bitcoin to their investment portfolio to reduce the risk. These findings imply significant differences between Islamic and conventional ones; the logical reason is the existence of screening criteria standards in Islamic cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the behavior of Islamic and conventional cryptocurrencies was also influenced by investor sentiment, where the investor in an Islamic portfolio should follow specific rules based on <italic>shariah</italic> compliance, including the prohibition of any speculation activities.</p><p id="p0250">In contrast with the previous studies, a research by <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Bahloul et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> ascertained that during the COVID-19 crisis period, bitcoin and Islamic stock indexes had a similar volatility pattern, and the two types of investment instruments did not offer safe-haven investment. Hence, it can be concluded that bitcoin has a similar characteristic with other investment instruments, and the massive amount of information related to bitcoin will gradually decrease the Muslim perspective regarding the uncertainty (<italic>gharar</italic>) of bitcoin. Moreover, However, the legal regulation related to <italic>shariah</italic> compliances of bitcoin should be designed to evaluate and improve its legality from an Islamic perspective. Another interesting study conducted by <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Echchabi et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> examined the predicting factors that affect Muslims in Oman to invest in Bitcoin and found that perceived ease of use, compatibility, awareness, and facilitating conditions plays a vital role in shaping the investor's intention. Importantly, this study underlines that the respondents believe they have a sufficient understanding and awareness of the Bitcoin concept, its benefits, and the strategies utilized to administer a Bitcoin account. Research that empirically assesses the investor behavior using a quasi-qualitative approach is still scarce; this topic becomes significant to investigate to obtain comprehensive knowledge regarding Muslim intention to adopt bitcoin.</p><p id="p0255"><italic>The second sub-stream is blockchain</italic>.

Blockchain classifies and records the transaction, which is connected to every party.

(2020)</xref>, and <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Arsyianti and Kassim (2018)</xref> analyze the role of Islamic banking in financial inclusion and how Islamic banking can be used as a tool for financial inclusion. Having access to the key financial services is the major indicator of the economic well-being, quality of life, and standard of living of the population all across the globe (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Banna et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr">Sain et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Not only that having access to these valuable financial services helps a person to make an online payment, access to credit and offers, investments, and getting banking and other financial services (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Aldoseri and Worthington, 2017</xref>). According to the Global Findex databases 2017, the situation in Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries remains worse as adults participating in the financial system or having no access to the financial services remains low as compared to the high-income countries. Despite the huge penetration of Islamic banks and financial services in these countries, the level of financial inclusion remains significantly low (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Baber, 2020a</xref>). There are 41% adults with the contribution in the financial system in OIC countries as compared to the 92% in the high-income countries. The report further stresses that around 75% of the world's unbanked population lives in developing countries. The unbanked population of the world is dominated by the Muslim countries with countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh with 5.2% and 3.7% of the worlds unbanked population respectively.</p><p id="p0305">There is a strong opportunity for Islamic FinTech to fill this gap by providing access to financial services to this segment of people and bringing confidence in the financial system through technology. Financial inclusion can be achieved by combining technology with Islamic finance and Islamic FinTech is the way to go forward (<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). There are also studies on the role of Islamic versus conventional finance in financial inclusion (<xref rid="bib112" ref-type="bibr">Nawaz, 2017</xref>). <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Albaity et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref> concluded that Islamic FinTech is based on the principles of ethics and morality and this characteristic makes it more fit for financial inclusion. S. <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Khan et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref> stressed that Islamic finance has some financial services like <italic>zakat</italic> which automatically leads to financial inclusion. This view is also confirmed from the findings of <xref rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr">Sain et&#x000a0;al. (2018)</xref>, which concludes that Islamic financial services combined with technology can lead to financial inclusion. On the other hand, there are credible studies like <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Baber (2020a)</xref> which concluded that there is no inter-relationship between FinTech adoption and financial inclusion. Voluminous studies have been proved that the integration of FinTech will uplift the number of banked population and boost the Islamic finance performance. Notwithstanding, the low quality of education, particularly for women and elder people in utilizing FinTech; the presence of risks such as network disruption and account securities, and the lower number of smartphone users; and lack of firm regulation related to FinTech become the prominent factors in preventing the massive adoption of FinTech in Islamic economics, finance, and banking. Therefore, the findings of existing studies suggest the need for the stakeholder to establish an impactful effort in creating a conducive environment for integrating FinTech in Islamic social-economy and financial institutions. Organizing regular seminars, campaigns, workshops, and training sessions in increasing digital financial literacy, which in turn, prompt the effectiveness of mobile banking usage specifically for the unbanked community, small business owners, undereducated people, women, and elder people (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Banna et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Ezzahid and Elouaourti, 2021</xref>). More importantly, a national and international standard for Islamic FinTech regulation is urgently needed to improve the integration of FinTech and Islamic financial institutions, as well as the qualification of <italic>shariah</italic> board members, particularly in technological aspects, to ensure that FinTech in the Islamic finance industry is regulated in accordance with <italic>shariah</italic> principles (<xref rid="bib127" ref-type="bibr">Razak et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.1.4"><label>4.1.4</label><title>Stream 4: Islamic FinTech and deposit-lending</title><p id="p0310">There are 19 previous studies on this stream, which can be divided into two sub-streams, namely, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending (4 articles) and crowdfunding (15 articles). Prior studies on P2P lending stress the challenge and potential development of Islamic P2P lending. To a large extent, this sub-stream discusses the current Islamic P2P platform development situation.</p><p id="p0315"><italic>The first sub-theme is p2p lending. P2P</italic> lending is a platform that enables borrowers to acquire a source of funds from the lender through the internet (<xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">Rosavina et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). The conventional concept of p2p differs from the Islamic concept, as lending can not be interest based, thus it is a sort of peer to peer financing which took the name of lending while it is indeed a <italic>shariah complaint</italic> financing in concept. P2P lending is one of the financial services provided by FinTech, it is predicted to become the most convenient financial platform for the unbanked community. Specifically, <xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">Rosavina et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref> investigate several influencing factors in using the Islamic P2P platform. This study ascertained that the rejection from banking institutions leads the customer to find other financing alternatives, such as P2P lending that offers a more extended payment period, <italic>shariah-based</italic> loans, and profit loss sharing schemes.</p><p id="p0320">In general, the P2P lending platform is predicted to become a &#x0201c;new banking service&#x0201d; with several additional advantages presented by the speed, efficiency, and channels better than the traditional bank (<xref rid="bib130" ref-type="bibr">Sa'ad et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). This phenomenon leads to an unwanted situation, the weakness of the banking system's contribution to economic development. However, rather than viewing the P2P lending platform as a competitor, the integration and collaboration between Islamic P2P lending and Islamic banks would promote the positive development trend of the business cycle, especially for the small business sector. Several studies investigate the possibility of optimizing the P2P platform. <xref rid="bib130" ref-type="bibr">Sa'ad et&#x000a0;al. (2019)</xref> proposed a model and argued that the MSC model is innovative and provides equal benefits for the parties: business owners, investors, and P2P companies. This model relied on the <italic>musharakah</italic> contract, where the business owners and investors agree to run the business and share the profit and loss-sharing equally based on the capital contributed. At the same time, the P2P company gains a fixed fee as the agent that connects the two parties.</p><p id="p0325">Related to the previous discussion regarding the <italic>musharakah</italic> contract, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Aprita and Adhitya (2020)</xref> emphasized that the profit and loss sharing scheme is effective in specific business models, and the scheme's implementation should be done by ensuring transparency between the parties. This study underlines that the P2P platform should create an upstream-downstream ecosystem that provides financial services and solutions for non-payment financing cases. Moreover, this study also suggested that P2P lending platforms collaborate with notaries or legal parties to promote safety and speed up transactions. From another perspective, <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Muhammad et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> demonstrated several significant factors that affect the failure of the P2P lending platform. This study pointed out that the higher level of debt and financing ratio and the weak support from the government will lead to the failure of the P2P platform. Most importantly, this study showed that the stricter Islamic principles applied by the P2P platform would reduce the probability of failure faced by the P2P platform. Therefore, this study calls on P2P players to improve the quality borrower selection criteria and lending prudence and run the platform under <italic>shariah</italic> compliance.</p><p id="p0330">Another interesting study by W. <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ali et&#x000a0;al. (2018)</xref> proposes a conceptual framework that predicts the intention to adopt FinTech in SMEs' Peer-to-Business (P2B) financing platform. This study highlights two prominent factors that arguably influence the adoption of the P2B platform. First, an internal factor is derived from cost, brand, security, perceived ease of use, and usefulness; second, external factors cover social influence and facilitating conditions. In addition, this study also highlights that the study on the intention to adopt P2P and P2B platforms by SMEs from an Islamic perspective is still underexamined. Therefore, this study suggests that extensive research is urgently needed to explain the predicting factors of SMEs adopting FinTech platforms.</p><p id="p0335"><italic>The second sub-theme in this stream is crowdfunding.</italic> Crowdfunding is the broader concept derived from crowdsourcing, which aims to collect financing from many individuals for social, profitable, or cultural projects (<xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Mollick, 2014</xref>). The literature has defined crowdfunding as an open call, essentially through the Internet, for the provision of financial resources either in the form of donations or in exchange for some form of reward and voting rights to support projects based on social, profitable, or cultural motives (<xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Mollick, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">Schwienbacher and Larralde, 2010</xref>). Historically, the first crowdfunding-based projects were initiated in 1800 to fund the Statue of Liberty's pedestal. In 2000, a website named <italic>AristShare</italic> was designed to provide a platform for artists to raise funds. The <xref rid="bib154" ref-type="bibr">World Bank (2013)</xref> categorized crowdfunding based on four main types. First, <italic>donation-based crowdfunding</italic> is purely based on donation and philanthropy; thus, there is no compensation for the party who provides the funds. Second, <italic>debt-based crowdfunding</italic> is based on debt-based contracts. The crowd lender provides the financing to small businesses or startups and receives a fixed interest and principal payment at a stipulated time. Third, <italic>reward-based crowdfunding</italic> is when the provider of funds receives an appreciation or reward in the form of a gift or acknowledgment for supporting the project. Lastly, <italic>equity-based crowdfunding</italic> is purely based on the profit and loss sharing mode of financing and is more aligned with venture capital.</p><p id="p0340">Previous literature on crowdfunding within the context of Islamic finance has mainly proposed crowding as a solution to the halal industry, the book publishing industry, startup companies, agricultural activities, and reviving waqf (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Abdullah and Oseni, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Ishak et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Hendratmi et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">Saiti, Musito, et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib156" ref-type="bibr">Zain et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). A few studies also focused on the development of crowdfunding and its awareness (<xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">Saiti, Musito, et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">Shofiyyah et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>).</p><p id="p0345">To begin with, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Abdullah and Oseni (2017)</xref> argue that equity crowdfunding inherently follows Islamic laws amid its structure of profit and loss sharing. However, scrutiny of its governance structure, business model, and products offered under the umbrella of equity crowdfunding is required. In detail, <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Ishak et&#x000a0;al. (2021)</xref> assess the possibility of implementing <italic>mudharabah</italic>-based crowdfunding for the book publishing industry, specifically self-publishers and small publishers. This study proposes a framework of <italic>mudharabah</italic> crowdfunding consisting of three parties: First, the publishers, as the <italic>mudharib</italic> (who have the professional capability of producing and publishing books), should offer detailed and transparent information regarding the business plan and profit estimation. Second, the platform is the agent who bridges the publisher and funders; the platform's responsibilities include marketing the books and promoting the publisher to obtain more funding sources. Third, the funders, such as the <italic>rab al-Mal</italic>, should have a clear and comprehensive understanding of the loss and return from the contracts and business activities.</p><p id="p0350">Equity crowdfunding can be a good source of external financing, especially for <italic>halal</italic> SMEs, which struggle to get financing from financial institutions. Likewise, <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Hendratmi et&#x000a0;al. (2020)</xref> proposed an innovative crowdfunding model by developing a website that will not only provide a good source of generating funds but also help connect geographically diversified investors. In a similar vein, <xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">Saiti, Afghan, et&#x000a0;al. (2018)</xref> suggested <italic>Salam-based</italic> crowdfunding for the agriculture industry to have access to funds. Moreover, a few studies also recommended crowdfunding based on the waqf model, especially in non-Muslim countries (<xref rid="bib156" ref-type="bibr">Zain et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, by conducting semi-structured interviews with the experts, <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Hapsari et&#x000a0;al.

(2019)</xref> declare that implementing crowdfunding for financing solar energy in Malaysian households is possible. This study underlines that the most profound factors affecting the model's acceptance are income, household size, and knowledge about climate change. In a nutshell, the findings of these studies agree that Islamic crowdfunding contributes substantially to escalating business performance in various fields of business. Especially for small-medium-sized enterprises, the owners can obtain additional fund resources based on <italic>shariah</italic> contracts, such as <italic>mudarabah, musyarakah</italic>, and <italic>salam</italic>. Hence, it is suggested that the government take significant action to optimize crowdfunding platforms as a source of funds.</p><p id="p0355">The development of the crowdfunding market depends on the market structure and economic development, advancement in the regulatory framework, and IT infrastructure. Moreover, <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Kazaure et&#x000a0;al.

Another research by <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Baber (2020b)</xref> found that integrating FinTech, particularly crowdfunding, into the Islamic banking system will escalate the business cycle of social entrepreneurship and micro-finance and build a firm platform for the global Islamic philanthropy system.

Foremost and the important one is the regulatory impediments that further restrict its growth. For example, a crowdfunding model is required for credit insurance to eliminate the credit risk. Since Islamic equity crowdfunding is based on the <italic>mudharabah</italic> model, it is a matter of concern whether the profit distribution mechanism follows the law of the country. Islamic crowdfunding is strictly allowed for businesses that are deemed permissible in Islam and not allowed to have a conventional lending approach i.e., involvement of interest (<xref rid="bib133" ref-type="bibr">Saiti, Musito, et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Lastly, frauds and scams are the major threats in establishing a stable crowdfunding market regardless of its structure and model (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Ishak and Rahman, 2021</xref>). Besides, from the business owner's perspective, by involving in an online crowdfunding platform, the possibility of their business ideas will be copied higher.

Hence, they tend to become more hesitant to obtain funding from online crowdfunding (<xref rid="bib126" ref-type="bibr">Rahman et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).

In detail, Islamic FinTech and deposit-lending consisting of cryptocurrency and blockchain sub-streams became the most discussed topics with 39% (33 out of 85 papers). The general analysis of the FinTech topic and the financial inclusion topic has attracted around 23%, followed by Islamic FinTech related to deposit and lending, consisting of two sub-streams, namely P2P lending and crowdfunding sub-streams (22%). Moreover, financial inclusion has become the least popular topic studied by researchers, as only 13 papers (15%) have been found in the Scopus database. Specifically, in terms of sub-theme topics, P2P lending has become the most underexamined topic, with only four publications in this field.</p><p id="p0375">In the disruptive era, industry 4.0, automation, and artificial intelligence, including Robo advisors in finance, have shown unprecedented growth with the possibility of replacing human resources (X. <xref rid="bib153" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). However, Islamic investment has specific criteria that should follow <italic>shariah</italic> compliance, thus, calling attention to this topic. Second, the current development of Islamic FinTech studies was heavily conducted in Asian countries with Muslim majorities, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Therefore, it is suggested that studies on these topics could be extended to other Muslim countries in the MENA beside some other non-Muslim majority countries.</p><p id="p0380">Lastly, the research method. Previous studies on crowdfunding, P2P lending, blockchain, and financial inclusion were mainly qualitative. These investment instruments are at the initial stage of integrating with Islamic finance. Thus, it required more quantitative and conceptual analysis regarding the models and <italic>shariah</italic> compliance. On the other hand, the existing studies on the FinTech stream mainly discussed quantitative methods based on secondary or primary data.

The study identified four streams that dominated the discussion of Islamic FinTech literature based on content analysis using the SLR-PRISMA approach. In detail, financial technology (customer perception towards Islamic FinTech, 8 articles, and Islamic FinTech development and its impact on Islamic Finance Institutions, 12 articles); Islamic FinTech and distributed ledger technology (Cryptocurrency 25 articles, and Blockchain, 8 articles), financial inclusion (13 articles); Islamic FinTech and deposit-lending (P2P Lending, 4 articles, and Crowdfunding, 15 articles).</p><p id="p0395">By conducting a content analysis on each stream, we reveal that the cointegration of FinTech in Islamic finance has enormous potential in elevating socio-economic development, particularly for the underdeveloped community, unbanked people, and small-medium-sized businesses. In addition, the adoption of FinTech in Islamic finance will support the government in improving financial inclusion, conquering financial crises, such as COVID-19's crisis, and achieving SDGs for a sustainable nation. However, the lack of laws, legal regulations and the lower financial literacy become the primary obstacles preventing the development of FinTech in Islamic finance. Additionally, based on the previous research's results, this study underlined that the <italic>shariah</italic> compliance of cryptocurrency and blockchain is still inconclusive with tendency toward rejection of cryptocurrency as a meduim of exchange.</p><p id="p0400">Aside from its theoretical and practical implications, this study has a limitation as it only utilized papers indexed by Scopus.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0405">Muneer M.

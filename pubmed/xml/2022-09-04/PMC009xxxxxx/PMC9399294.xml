Refugees and asylum seekers flee their countries because of persecution, war, and/or violence, and many are exposed to torture and trauma (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Forced displacement of populations has occurred for centuries as a result of &#x02018;persecution, conflict, generalized violence, and human rights violations (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The United Nations Refugee Convention defines a refugee as a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to or, owing to such fear, unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>When a person shifts his residence from one political or administrative boundary to another, it is known as &#x0201c;migration.&#x0201d; Migration is a social phenomenon and can be understood as a part of society. Migration is also called a process of people adapting to a new environment which involves making decisions, preparations, going through the procedure, shifting physically to another geographical area, adjusting to the local cultural needs, and becoming a part of the local system. When a person goes through this process, it will have a definite influence on his/her life as a whole (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Migration is a process of population movement either across an international border or within a country (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Globally, five to ten million people cross an international border yearly to take up residence in a different country with a higher percentage of women than men (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as "a complete physical, mental, and social condition, not merely the absence of disease." Mental health is one of the most important aspects of health, and according to the definition of the World Health Organization, mental health is included in the general concept of health, which is the full ability to play socio-mental and physical roles and not the existence of retardation (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>SDH is the &#x02018;conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age...[which] are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). SDH can be considered to be &#x02018;the causes of the causes of health inequities' (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Dahlgren and Whitehead in their influential SDH model, highlight relevant conditions at various levels that affect health - individual factors (e.g., age, sex), individual lifestyle factors (e.g., exercise, smoking), social and community networks, living and working conditions (e.g., education, work environment, housing) and general socioeconomic, cultural and environmental conditions (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>The risks for developing mental disorders and poorer mental health are greater for members of groups with less access to power, material resources, and policymaking as a result of broader social, political, and economic factors that sustain inequalities (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>Refugees are the most vulnerable to mental health problems of all migrant groups (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Epidemiological studies measuring the prevalence of mental health disorders in resettled refugee populations have found high rates of psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Migration involves certain phases to go through; hence, it is a process. Many times, lack of preparedness, difficulties in adjusting to the new environment, the complexity of the local system, language difficulties, cultural disparities, and adverse experiences would cause distress to the migrants. Moreover, subsequently, it hurts the mental well-being of such a population (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Given the importance of the role of social factors affecting the mental health of refugees and migrants, this study examines the evidence on the social determinants of mental health among immigrants and refugees.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study reviewed studies involving a social determinant of mental health in refugees and migrants.

In all studies, the study aimed to investigate and determine the social factors affecting mental health among refugees and immigrants.</p><p>In most studies, social determinants of mental health were common among refugees and immigrants. Age, Gender, Marital Status, Occupational Status, Race, Ethnicity, Housing, Income, English Proficiency, Multi Sex, Partner, Recreational Drugs Social Status, Social Support Within and Outside the Family, Social Influence, Activities and Conditions Physicality, length of stay in the destination country, biological and behavioral conditions, sense of belonging to the community, time of migration

conditions and factors in the path of migration affect the health and mental health of immigrants. The choice of immigration method, the way of settling in the destination country, the ability to adapt to the environment and culture of the destination country, the attitude of the people of the destination country towards immigrants, etc., are examples that affect the mental health of immigrants; But how can this impact be directed in the positive direction of improving the mental health of immigrants?</p><p>Most people who choose to be refugees are under psychological pressure. They will experience more stress and psychological problems than other immigrants: Experience of the unsafe route, dealing with environmental hazards, high uncertainty, living in unprincipled camps, etc. Therefore, their mental health will be greatly endangered compared to other immigrants</p><p>Research studies from around the world show that migration is a complex process. Migration affects different people in different ways. In other words, migrating without planning and awareness will often be accompanied by stressful events, obstacles, and challenges. If the migration is planned and done with awareness, its consequences are managed, not only it will be successful, but also it will improve the level of mental health and satisfaction of people</p><p>The mental health of people who immigrate without knowing the language of the destination country is more at risk than other immigrants. These people are not able to communicate with the people of the destination community. They have difficulty meeting their daily needs and will not have much ability to find friends in the destination country; therefore, to reduce the stress caused by migration and maintain the mental health of people in migration, they should be somewhat familiar with the language of the destination country. This is especially true for people who are migrating to study and obtain a student visa.</p><p>Most people who choose to immigrate as refugees do not have the right to return to their homeland. Therefore, they will be separated from their families and relatives sometimes for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately, this greatly affects the mental health of immigrants and will have devastating consequences for them.</p><p>The migration process alone does not endanger the health of people; in many cases, it improves their standard of living. Especially if the migration is done correctly and with complete information about the destination country; But if the migration process is not done properly, it can lead to many problems in the mental health of immigrants</p><p>According to the latest studies of researchers, the level of economy and welfare of the destination country and the governments' treatment of immigrants will have a direct impact on their health and mental health.</p><p>Some factors improve the mental health of immigrants in the destination country. These factors include finding a suitable place to live, getting good job opportunities, joining family members in the destination country, access to better public services, access to better health care, lack of cultural restrictions, and so on</p><p>According to our study, social determinants such as age, gender, income, education, housing, employment, English language proficiency, race and ethnicity, and social support are among the factors that have a significant impact on the mental health of immigrants and refugees.</p><p>According to the findings of this study, people who migrate at a younger age have more flexibility to adapt to the environment. By accepting the customs of the destination country, these people can adapt more to the environment. But it is difficult for older people to adapt to the customs of the destination country, given that they have lived longer in their own country. Therefore, migration in older people affects their mental health.</p><p>The findings of this study showed that gender is one of the factors affecting the mental health of refugees and migrants. In her study, Delara et al. found that women who migrate were at greater risk than men and that their mental health was greater than that of men. People migrate for a variety of reasons, but women usually have their motivations, including joining their family, economic incentives, and educational opportunities, as well as escaping gender discrimination and/or political violence and gaining more social independence. While there are many benefits for immigration, living in a new society poses many challenges for migrant and refugee women. Immigrant women may also face many difficulties in accessing the health care system due to communication, psychological, social, spiritual and religious, structural, economic, and cultural barriers (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</p><p>based on a study by Mawani et al., employment and income are some of the factors affecting the mental health of refugees. These people have lower employment rates than people in the same country. Refugees often live in less economically disadvantaged cities in the destination country, and because of national dispersal policies, refugees are often unable to choose their cities or neighborhoods, so they are forced to live in cities that may be economically viable. It is weak and they cannot get the job they want and have low-income jobs. This makes them unable to meet their basic needs with the income they get from their job. On the other hand, severe financial constraints that force them to live in densely populated low-income neighborhoods cause refugees to face unique mental health challenges (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Hynie et al. stated in their study that job availability is not for refugees. It is important not only because of income generation but also because of the sense of purpose, identity, and social connection that jobs themselves provide, and the important impact of the physical and psychological social environment of the workplace on mental health (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Harrigan stated in his study that immigrants' employment affects their mental health. Threats of deportation generally affect the health of immigrants and harm their mental health (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>According to Goodkind 's study findings, the impact of post-migration stressors (poverty, lack of access to resources, loss of social support and valuable social roles, discrimination/marginalization, English language proficiency) on refugees' persistent mental health is evident. Since these people spend most of their financial resources and they cannot get a good job in the destination country, their income decreases, and they become poor. On the other hand, they will face the problem of lack of social support in the destination country. These people cannot be successful in social relationships with other people due to a lack of English language proficiency (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>According to Salami et al.'s study, people who have recently immigrated to Canada feel more belonging to the community, have a higher income, have more well-being, and as a result, have better mental health and lower stress and depression. But immigrants who have been living for 10 years were dissatisfied with their situation and were in worse mental health than the first group (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Hollander 's study showed that refugees are in a worse mental health condition than non-refugees. Refugee men have a higher relative mortality risk for cardiovascular disease and external causes of death than non-refugee individuals. The relative risk of hospitalization due to depressive disorder following unemployment is higher among immigrant women (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>In Campbell et al.'s study, refugees who were unemployed or underemployed, lived in poor housing, had less contact with social support networks, had economic problems, did not have a good understanding of English, and had poor mental health (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>In their study, Wong et al. supported the relationship between the number of family members and friends in reducing immigrants' depression, which is due to increased social support by family and friends. Immigrants typically have more concerns about the well-being of family members in the host country, often due to limited contact with family members and the stress of prolonged separation. The more contacts a person has with family and friends, the better their mental health will be (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>In this study, it was tried to avoid any bias by conducting a comprehensive and systematic search. However, the failure to follow a standard cost detection approach in the selected studies had reduced the consistency of the reported results; hence, it might prevent the analysis of the reported results on the basis of different dimensions. Most studies have been conducted in developed countries such as Canada, and one study discusses the importance of migration among women, which could be an important issue in future studies. This systematic review study undoubtedly provides very valuable information about the factors affecting the mental health of refugees and migrants for individuals and communities, which shows the importance of the mental health of these people around the world.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Age, sex, marital status, employment, race, ethnicity, housing, income, English language proficiency, multi sex, partner, recreational drugs use, social status, social support inside and outside the family, social influence, activities, and physical conditions, length of stay in the destination country, biological conditions and behavior, sense of belonging to the community, time of migration and satisfaction with the place of residence are important social determinants in the mental health of immigrants and refugees. Improving each of these factors plays an important role in increasing the level of mental health of these people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conflict of interests" id="s6"><title>Conflict of

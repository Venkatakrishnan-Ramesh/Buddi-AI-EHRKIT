DMI is associated with damage in the vessels that supply blood to the retina and the enlargement of the foveal avascular zone. Currently, there are no approved treatments specifically for DMI. Furthermore, there is limited published information about the prognosis, prevalence or outcomes of DMI, and there is no consensus regarding diagnostic criteria. It is vital to ensure that there is sufficient, accessible and accurate information available to support patients, caregivers and physicians. To lay the foundation for more research into DMI and its impact on patients, we (a patient with DMI and an expert ophthalmologist) have worked together to interweave our personal perspectives and clinical experiences with a review of currently available literature on DMI. The development of a set of confirmed diagnostic criteria for DMI would assist both patients and physicians, allowing patients to access validated information about their condition and supporting the development of clinical trials for treatments of DMI. Training for physicians must continue to emphasise the importance of treating a patient holistically, rather than only treating their symptoms. Most importantly, developing trust and a healthy rapport between a patient and their physician is important in managing health anxiety and ensuring adherence to beneficial treatments or lifestyle adjustments; physicians must cultivate an open and flexible management approach with their patients. Finally, holistic educational programmes for patients, physicians and the general public around DMI and how it can affect daily functioning would facilitate general understanding and disease awareness.</p><sec><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40123-022-00546-3.</p></sec></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="summary"><title>Plain Language Summary</title><p>Diabetic macular ischemia (DMI) is a common problem for patients with diabetic retinopathy that can lead to sight loss. There is very little information available about DMI, particularly from a patient&#x02019;s point of view. To address the lack of information about DMI, we (a person with DMI and her eye doctor) have worked together to examine what it is like to live with DMI.
It is important to provide clear and accessible information about diseases to patients and carers. The lack of information about DMI may be upsetting for some people, and should be addressed with more research. Developing of a set of confirmed signs and symptoms for the diagnosis of DMI would allow people to be more confident in the information that they receive about their disease, and support the development of treatments for DMI.
The support of others is central to the wellbeing of people with vision loss. Although people with vision loss may also lose independence, care from loved ones can help to improve quality of life. Most importantly, developing trust between a patient and their doctor is central to managing people&#x02019;s fears about their eyesight, and making sure that they follow helpful advice. Doctors must use an open and flexible approach with their patients, providing information in an honest and understandable way.</p><p id="Par65">

Diabetic macular ischemia (DMI) is a common complication of DR that can result in progressive and irreversible vision loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although DR is well studied, with several treatment options available depending on disease stage and severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], there is limited published information on the prognosis, prevalence or outcomes of DMI and no consensus regarding diagnostic criteria. As a result, although comparisons can be made with existing research into related conditions, such as DR and other diseases that cause vision loss, accessible information specifically on DMI is scarce in comparison to information on other retinal conditions. Furthermore, there are currently no approved treatments specifically for DMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; instead, guidelines tend to focus on the management of risk factors that lead to the development of DR (e.g. optimising glycaemic and blood pressure control) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>What is Diabetic Macular Ischemia?</title><p id="Par4">Although there is no consensus on the diagnostic features of DMI and very little clinical research in the field, a number of characteristics are associated with its onset and progression. DMI is linked to damage in the vessels that supply blood to the retina&#x02014;specifically in layers known as the superficial vascular complex, deep vascular complex and choriocapillaris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These layers supply oxygen to the macula, which is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, high-quality vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Reduced retinal blood flow and vessel density have been associated with photoreceptor disruption and subsequent vision loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, DMI is characterised by the enlargement of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), which in turn is linked to vision loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. DMI often occurs alongside other complications of DR, most notably diabetic macular edema (DME), which is the result of excess fluid in the macula, although the relationship between DMI and DME is not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Although the global prevalence of visual impairment and blindness is generally decreasing, visual impairment specifically as a result of DR continues to increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Vision loss in patients with moderate-to-severe DMI may reach &#x02018;20/80 vision&#x02019;, which is the equivalent of seeing at 20&#x000a0;ft what a person with normal vision (20/20) would see at 80&#x000a0;ft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, vision as poor as 20/400 has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As a result of a lack of consensus regarding the diagnosis of DMI, it is difficult to determine exactly how many people have the disease; however, research suggests that up to 77% of patients with the most severe form of DR (proliferative DR) may have DMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition to progressive and irreversible vision loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], DMI may increase the chance of developing further complications, including DME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As DMI can result in permanent vision loss, there is an urgent need for effective treatment.</p><p id="Par6">Two of the biggest factors limiting the study of DMI are the paucity of available data and a general lack of awareness of the condition among researchers, physicians and patients. In particular, there is no research focusing on the perspectives of patients who may have DMI, how well informed they feel about the disease, how it feels to have a condition with no treatment, or how a lack of formal diagnosis might affect their daily lives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>A Patient&#x02019;s Perspective on DMI</title><p id="Par7">To lay the foundation for more research into DMI and its impact on patients, we&#x02014;Jacqueline Humphreys (a patient with DMI) and Sobha Sivaprasad (an expert ophthalmologist and Jacqueline&#x02019;s treating physician)&#x02014;have worked together to interweave our personal perspectives and clinical experiences with a review of currently available literature. Jacqueline is 61&#x000a0;years old, and qualified as a registered osteopath in 1984. She has been involved in osteopathic education alongside private practice for most of her career, and is currently a clinical tutor and lecturer for the Masters in Osteopathy course at Swansea University.</p><p id="Par8">Jacqueline was diagnosed with DR prior to receiving a diagnosis of diabetes, and her symptoms have evolved over time. Although it is difficult to distinguish which experiences derive from DMI versus other complications of DR (as they frequently occur together), her experiences provide an invaluable and unique insight into living with DMI as part of DR, as well as the lived experience of vision loss in general.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Jacqueline&#x02019;s Experience with Diagnosis of Vision Loss</title><p id="Par9">

Unfortunately, this means that it can be hard for an individual to distinguish the difference between natural age-related changes in vision and the onset of a disease.<disp-quote><p id="Par12">&#x0201c;The optician was frankly not very straightforward. She kept sucking her teeth and making a funny face, and I asked, &#x02018;What are you seeing in my eyes?&#x02019; She just didn&#x02019;t say anything. Then I started listing everything I knew within my eye that might be causing a problem. I got to haemorrhages, and her face just kind of cracked, so she was clearly seeing them. She said, &#x02018;Well, I&#x02019;m going to write a note for your doctor, and they&#x02019;re going to take it forward&#x0201d;.</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par13">&#x0201c;Bedside manner&#x0201d; is typically considered an important aspect of care but has received little attention in published literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, existing research indicates that healthcare professionals (HCPs) tend to underestimate how much information a patient wants to receive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Patients under the age of 60&#x000a0;years or educated to at least a college level are significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00007, respectively) more likely than others to want detailed information about their condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This is especially relevant for diseases such as DR, because patients may be diagnosed as early as 20&#x000a0;years of age. Furthermore, DR typically develops in nearly all patients with early-onset type&#x000a0;1 diabetes within 20&#x000a0;years of diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].<disp-quote><p id="Par14">&#x0201c;I had no other signs of diabetes than my vision.

Many countries have robust screening programmes for diseases such as DR, and patients are typically automatically enrolled upon diagnosis with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; however, up to 21% of patients with type&#x000a0;2 diabetes already have DR at the time of diagnosis with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

One recent real-world example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the delayed treatment of patients with DR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Across a number of treatment centres, delays in treatment ranging from approximately 5 to 20&#x000a0;weeks resulted in reduced visual acuity and an increased risk of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].<disp-quote><p id="Par18">&#x0201c;When I arrived at my GP surgery with my note, they said, &#x02018;Oh, nobody&#x02019;s got any time to see you today&#x02026; go away&#x0201d;.</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par19">It is imperative to effectively triage patients who are at risk of permanent vision loss.

Fortunately, there is increasing interest from HCPs in the role that patients play in their own healthcare decisions, particularly within ophthalmology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].<disp-quote><p id="Par24">&#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t know whether information is not offered or whether it&#x02019;s not offered in an easily understandable way.

The juniors in the department seemed almost afraid to tell me what they saw&#x02014;or wouldn&#x02019;t or couldn&#x02019;t explain the scans to me. It&#x02019;s very difficult to trust somebody who seems a bit reticent, but then says, &#x02018;OK, so shall we go and put an injection in your eye now?&#x02019; It&#x02019;s like, &#x02018;No, I don&#x02019;t think we will!&#x02019;&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par25">Building trust between HCPs and patients is important for successful care; new patients are at particular risk of missing follow-up visits or dropping out of care entirely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Being transparent with test results, encouraging questions and facilitating open discussion of a patient&#x02019;s treatment preferences are effective ways to build HCP&#x02013;patient trust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. It is clear that both the initial steps towards diagnosis of a person with vision loss and decisions about subsequent care must be handled carefully to ensure the best care outcomes for patients. Providing opticians with specific training around speaking with patients who require further specialist care may help to ease the diagnosis journey of those with DR. This is especially true considering that, for a sizeable group of people, their first encounter with a diagnosis of diabetes and DR may happen at a standard eye care appointment.<disp-quote><p id="Par26">&#x0201c;I went on the internet. When I first started looking at it, there were maybe two or three things that might have been useful.

A PubMed search conducted on the term &#x0201c;diabetic macular ischemia&#x0201d; on 8&#x000a0;October 2021 yielded only 35 results, with the majority of papers published in 2019 or later. For comparison, there were almost 4000 results for DME and close to 40,000 for DR. With so little peer-reviewed information on DMI available for physicians, it is no surprise that information that is accessible to patients is even more limited. Furthermore, information sourced online by patients may not be accurate: one study indicated that, although using Google to research eye problems significantly improves the ability to answer disease-related questions correctly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003), the information found online was incomplete and unreliable in terms of treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

Developing suitable guidelines on how to introduce canes to patients (for physicians and local authorities) and on how to use canes for identification, orientation and mobility (for people with visual impairment) may be one way to restore confidence and independence for people with vision loss.<disp-quote><p id="Par40">&#x0201c;Generally speaking, walking around the place, it makes you very vulnerable when you have the white stick.

However, the white cane also highlights a person&#x02019;s impairment, which may cause the user to feel vulnerable, self-conscious and embarrassed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In some cases, the use of a white cane can result in family members becoming anxious and overprotective, hindering the user&#x02019;s ability to learn how to travel independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].<disp-quote><p id="Par42">&#x0201c;It&#x02019;s useful for judging depth, certainly.

One study used augmented-reality technology to translate three-dimensional visual information into audio feedback via a mobile telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]; although participants rapidly learnt to navigate using this system, it did not provide significant advantages over using a white cane with 10&#x000a0;h of training. Other researchers are developing a technology based on haptic feedback, such as a Wearable Virtual Cane Network that uses vibration at the wrists and ankles to signal how close an object is to the wearer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. When using the Wearable Virtual Cane Network, walking speed increased by an average of 23%. Furthermore, when used in combination with a white cane, navigation was significantly improved (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Finally, the EyeCane is a cane augmentation technology that provides haptic and auditory feedback about obstacles while retaining the lightweight, low-cost benefits of a standard white cane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The EyeCane has been shown to improve a person&#x02019;s ability to detect, identify and avoid large and high obstacles while walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] and requires only a few minutes of training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Investing in navigational technologies may improve the safety and personal autonomy of people with low vision.<disp-quote><p id="Par44"><italic>&#x0201c;It is difficult to have no creative outlet&#x0201d;.</italic></p><p id="Par45">&#x0201c;I used to do a lot of crafting, I used to make cards and so on&#x02014;and I really can&#x02019;t do that now.

In addition, leisure activities such as reading, social interaction, hobbies and watching television are negatively affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that the currently available rehabilitation interventions for people with poor vision are effective: a review of 44 studies found that interventions (ranging from psychological therapies to rehabilitation programmes and assistive technologies) ultimately had little effect on quality of life, although it was acknowledged that the available data were limited by short follow-up periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. One study in 2020 showed that smartphone apps were effective, practical and useable reading aids for people with visual impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Rehabilitation programmes that are based on the perspectives of patients could be more effective at improving aspects of daily life that are important to people with vision loss.</p><p id="Par47">

</p><p id="Par49">DMI is linked to loss of vision in the central macula, which is a region responsible for sharp, high-quality vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It has been found that people with simulated central vision impairment equivalent to that caused by DMI (20/80 vision) do not adjust their driving speed and therefore drive less safely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Increased difficulty with driving relates to two of the commonly cited concerns for patients with DR: loss of independence and loss of mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Moreover, the inability to drive also intensifies social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and increases the likelihood of depression, even when controlling for age, sex, education and health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Furthermore, being unable to drive as a result of visual impairment makes it difficult to go shopping and therefore difficult to prepare and cook meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]; consequently, even basic living tasks require active support from others.<disp-quote><p id="Par50"><italic>&#x0201c;I&#x02019;m very fortunate that my partner is both able and willing to support me.

Social isolation after vision loss is common, and DR can negatively impact interpersonal relationships; one study showed that 50% of patients separated from their partner a mean of 1.6&#x000a0;years after the onset of vision impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].

It has been estimated that informal carers spend approximately 9&#x000a0;h per week caring for people with vision loss, increasing to 94.1&#x000a0;h per week as vision deteriorates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]<italic>.</italic> The impact of caring for parents on the reported mental health of middle-aged carers (aged 50&#x02013;58&#x000a0;years) is known to be substantial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], but for some people, caring for a partner has greater adverse effects on their mental health than caring for a parent, regardless of age or socio-economic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].

For complications such as DMI, for which there is little published research but a growing interest, it is critical to consider and integrate patient perspectives into the development of educational programmes, treatments and research in general.<disp-quote><p id="Par57"><italic>&#x0201c;It would be a huge step forward for clinicians if they had a set of criteria to work with.&#x0201d;</italic></p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par58">Currently, there are no standardised diagnostic criteria for DMI. In addition to the lack of available treatment, this can mean that physicians are reluctant to diagnose a patient with DMI.

Establishing a consensus diagnosis for DMI will help to standardise research into the subject, as well as to ensure that patients have access to validated information. In addition, a formal diagnostic criterion would support the much-needed development of a treatment for DMI. It is critical that physicians cultivate an open and flexible management approach with their patients, providing information in a digestible manner. In addition, holistic educational programmes for patients, physicians and the general public around DMI and how it can affect daily functioning would facilitate general understanding and disease awareness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec id="d32e754"><title>Funding</title><p> No funding or sponsorship was received for this review.

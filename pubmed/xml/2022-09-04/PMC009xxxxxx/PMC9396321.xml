The levels of miR-494-3p and TRIM36 were measured in normal hepatocytes, THLE-2, and HepG2 and HuH7HCC cell lines, along with the protein expression of cyclin D/E and p21. The proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of HCC cells were assayed. The interactions between miR-494-3p and TRIM36, and between TRIM36 and cyclin E were assessed. Finally, the expression and localization of TRIM36 and cyclin E were monitored, and tumor apoptosis was detected, in tumor xenograft model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>EPS1-1 suppressed HCC cell proliferation and cyclin D/E expression and promoted apoptosis and p21 expression. miR-494-3p was upregulated and TRIM36 was downregulated in HCC cells. Transfection with miR-494-3p mimic or sh-TRIM36 facilitated HCC cell proliferation and the expression of cyclin D/E protein but they inhibited apoptosis and p21 expression in the presence of EPS1-1. Overexpression of TRIM36 further consolidated EPS1-1-mediated inhibition of HCC proliferation, cyclin D/E, and the promotion of apoptosis and p21 expression. Those effects were reversed by miR-494-3p overexpression. TRIM36 was a target gene of miR-494-3p, and TRIM36 induced cyclin E ubiquitination. EPS1-1 suppressed cyclin E expression, promoted TRIM36 expression and tumor apoptosis, all of which were abrogated by increasing the expression of miR-494-3p <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>EPS1-1 protected against HCC by limiting its proliferation and survival through the miR-494-3p/TRIM36 axis and by inducing cyclin E ubiquitination.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Extracellular polysaccharide</kwd><kwd>EPS1-1</kwd><kwd>miR-494-3p</kwd><kwd>TRIM36</kwd><kwd>Ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>Hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death and remains one of the most aggressive malignancies worldwide.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although liver resection is one of the most effective treatment options, the prognosis of HCC is extremely poor, with a 1-year survival of 40%.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Thus, identifying the underlying mechanisms contributing to the progression of HCC is crucial to facilitate the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets.</p><p>In recent years, considerable attention has been paid to the study of natural antitumor compounds with known biological activities and few or no side effects.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

We observed that EPS1-1 treatment inhibited HCC cell progression by downregulating the tumor promoter miR-494-3p to promote TRIM36 expression, which in turn induced ubiquitination of cyclin E. Previous studies have shown that EPS1-1 has antitumor activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and was reported to be a tumor suppressor in HCC,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> but causative relationships have not been elucidated yet. This study investigated the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition of HCC cell and tumor growth of HCC by EPS1-1 polysaccharide extracted from <italic>R. nigrum</italic>. EPS1-1, at concentrations of 25&#x02013;200 &#x000b5;g/mL decreased HCC cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle suppression is recognized as a potential target in cancer therapy,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> and in this study, EPS1-1 treatment induced G0/G1 phase arrest in HCC cells. Cell cycle progression is dependent on CDK, arrested by CDK inhibitors, and activated by cyclin binding.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> EPS1-1 reduced the expression of the cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D and cyclin E expression and it increased the expression of p21, a CDK inhibitor, (p21) in a dose-dependent manner, indicating potent inhibitory effects of EPS1-1 on HCC cell proliferation. Promotion of cell apoptosis is an important mechanism of action of anticancer drugs,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and EPS1-1 at 100 and 200 &#x000b5;g/mL significantly promoted the apoptosis of HCC cells. Our findings demonstrate the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of EPS1-1 in HCC cells, which is not only in line with earlier studies but a further confirmation of the effects of EPS1-1 on cancer cell progression. Nonetheless, the working molecular mechanism of EPS1-1 has not been previously described.</p><p>In recent years, miRNAs have been shown to play significant roles in modulating the progression of several types of cancers, including HCC.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Previous studies indicated that miR-494-3p is upregulated in HCC,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and suggested it is a tumor promoter in HCC. Herein, we demonstrated that miR-494-3p was a key player in EPS1-1-mediated inhibition of HCC. We also showed that miR-494-3p was overexpressed in HCC cells and significantly suppressed following EPS1-1 treatment (100 &#x000b5;g/mL and 200 &#x000b5;g/mL). Moreover, in the presence of EPS1-1, miR-494-3p overexpression significantly promoted proliferation and cyclin D/E expression in HCC cells while it decreased p21 expression, the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase, and apoptosis. Taken together, the data reveal that EPS1-1 suppressed HCC proliferation and boosted cell apoptosis via inhibiting miR-494-3p expression.</p><p>miRNAs directly bind to the 3&#x02032;-UTR of target mRNAs and then downregulate expression of the corresponding gene.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> TRIM36 a TRIM family member, was identified as a target of miR-320a.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Previously, TRIM36 downregulation was reported in gastric and prostate cancer cells and tissues, but its expression in HCC has not been reported.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> We found that TRIM36 was weakly expressed in HCC and it had a binding site for miR-494-3p. Overexpression of miR-494-3p in HCC suppressed TRIM36 expression and inhibition of miR-494-3 enhanced TRIM36 expression. Increased TRIM36 expression has been shown to indicate a favorable prognosis, and TRIM36 is a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation and stimulating apoptosis.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> This background prompted us to explore the role of TRIM36 in the inhibition of EPS1-1 in HCC. TRIM36 levels were upregulated by EPS1-1 treatment. Cell proliferation was enhanced, and cell apoptosis was decreased, by TRIM36 inhibition and EPS1-1 treatment. The presence of both EPS1-1 and TRIM36 overexpression effectively blunted the progression of HCC cells. Moreover, miR-494-3p overexpression partially counteracted the synergic effects of EPS1-1 and TRIM36 on suppressing HCC. The data support EPS1-1 suppression of HCC cell development via a miR-494-3p/TRIM36 axis. The TRIM protein family includes E3 ubiquitin ligases with activity related to a broad range of biological and pathological processes.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Our data demonstrated that TRIM36 has unique E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and TRIM36 overexpression induced the ubiquitination of cyclin E in HCC. Additionally, <italic>in vivo</italic> animal experiments revealed that administration of EPS1-1 repressed tumor growth in nude mice by regulating miR-494-3p/TRIM36 axis and ubiquitination of cyclin E. In addition to TRIM36, miR-494-3p has been reported to promote HCC metastasis by targeting PTEN,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and the regulatory activity was reported in non-small cell lung cancer and glioma in which miR-494-3p was sponged by the long noncoding RNA WT1-AS1.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00301-b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In-depth studies are needed to elucidate the impact of the interactions between miR-494-3p and other known HCC targets, which would facilitate the development of miRNA-based treatment of HCC.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our study describes a working molecular mechanism for EPS1-1 inhibition of proliferation and survival of HCC <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The inhibitory effects of EPS1-1 were achieved through downregulation of miR-494-3p expression and upregulation of TRIM36-mediated ubiquitination of cyclin E, ultimately regulating the progression of HCC. HCC treatments that include EPS1-1 may be useful and warrant further study.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5a1"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>All procedures involving humans were performed with

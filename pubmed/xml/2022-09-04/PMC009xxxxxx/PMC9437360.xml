Patellar tendon injury is often misdiagnosed at emergency rooms, leading to chronic proximal retraction and a challenging clinical scenario. Proximal PT injuries are more common, while distal ones, which can involve tibial bone avulsion fractures or direct tendon avulsion, are rarer. The low incidence of distal PT rupture and the variety of injury patterns make a personal approach reasonable when based on the intraoperative findings and the surgeon's experience. Our purpose is to describe a surgical technique to restore the knee extensor mechanism after chronic distal PT rupture using two kinds of graft, one as a waveform augmentation of the native tendon and the other as reinforcement in a letter X aspect.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0017"><title>Technique Video</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2a"><caption><title>Video 1</title><p>With the patient in the supine position and under spinal anesthesia, a longitudinal incision is made from the middle central third of the patella to the anterior tibial tuberosity (ATT).

Adjustable suspensory fixation in the patella and tendon augmentation in the hamstrings were reported as giving a stable fixation for patients with chronic proximal patellar avulsion.

In reinforcement and augmentation techniques, transtibial bone tunnels are usually used for distal graft fixation.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p id="p0105">In the technique reported in this paper, we seek to increase the potential for ligamentization of the gracilis graft by transversing the remaining patellar tendon like a wave, creating a primary repair of the injured tissue. We added the X-shaped reinforcement with the semitendinosus graft to protect this repair and, as regards anatomy and biology, it ends up becoming a reinforcement that would serve as a backup if the first procedure failed, hence allowing early postoperative range of motion and decreasing the chance of failure.</p><p id="p0110">We used the cerclage wire temporarily, thus ensuring the correct patellar height and freeing us throughout the surgery from the influence of flexion and extension maneuvers that could allow inadequate tensioning of the grafts.

As we use autologous tendons in trans-osseous passages, we dispense with the use of synthetic augmentation and other fixation devices, in addition to the two metallic anchors and suture threads. Reconstruction also has the advantage of allowing early mobilization in a very safe way, thus eliminating the need for reinforcing steel wires, which usually require a second surgical procedure for their removal.</p><p id="p0125">Compared to techniques that use synthetic reinforcement or isolated primary repairs, the method requires a longer surgical time to remove the tendon grafts and perforate the bone tunnels. Its advantages and disadvantages are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>. Care must be taken in the construction of these bone tunnels, especially regarding the depth of the perforation in reaction to the anterior, posterior, and inferior cortices of the patella and the anterior cortical of the tibia, to minimize the risk of an avulsion fracture by traction of the graft itself; hence, fluoroscopic control is critical. Care must also be taken to ensure that the reconstruction brings the patella to its average height. Before fixing the tendons, we use the temporary cerclage wire at the beginning of the procedure, the pitfalls of which are summarized in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Advantages and Disadvantages</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Advantages</th><th>Disadvantages</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Costs are low</td><td>Longer surgical time</td></tr><tr><td>Repair is biological</td><td>Morbidity in the graft donor area</td></tr><tr><td>Metallic cerclage requires no maintenance</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Allows early mobilization</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Ensures adequate patellar height</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Requires no synthetic augmentation</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Pitfalls</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Risk of patellar fracture</td></tr><tr><td>Risk of avulsion fracture at the level of the anterior cortex of the tibia</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Miyamoto</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Otsuka</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hasue</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Acute traumatic patellar tendon rupture at the tibial tuberosity attachment without avulsion fracture</article-title><source>Case Rep Orthop</source><year>2017</year><fpage>2537028</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">28856026</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>M.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>W.K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Performance-based outcomes following patellar tendon repair in professional athletes</article-title><source>Phys Sportsmed</source><volume>48</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>110</fpage><lpage>115</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/00913847.2019.1642809</pub-id><comment>Epub 2019 Jul 16.

<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2"><caption><title>Video 1</title><p>With the patient in the supine position and under spinal anesthesia, a longitudinal incision is made from the middle central third of the patella to the anterior tibial tuberosity (ATT). After deep layer dissection, the peritendon is incised longitudinally to identify the patellar tendon.</p><p>This is followed by lateral and medial patellar retinaculum opening and visualization of the lesion at the distal insertion of the patellar tendon in the ATT.</p><p>The gracilis and semitendinosus tendons grafts are harvested, with the aid of the tendon striper, the muscle remaining is removed, and the grafts are sutured with Ethibond threads using simple running stitches at the ends.</p><p>At the ATT level, a guidewire is drilled transversely, approximately 1.5 cm deep and 2 cm long. Next, a 4.5-mm drill is used to create a transverse tunnel, which will initially pass the 1.0 mm cerclage wire.</p><p>A cerclage is performed around the patella, with the steel wire being passed on supra-patellar and sub-quadricipital positions. Then the wire is introduced through the bone tunnel of the tibial.</p><p>The adjustment of the patellar height is made with the aid of fluoroscopy, with the knee flexed at 30&#x000b0;. The patella is pulled distally to the ideal height, where the lower pole is at the same level as the femoral intercondylar roof.</p><p>A guidewire is drilled transversely 1.5 cm proximal to the distal pole of the patella and a bone tunnel is performed with a 4.5-mm drill. At this moment, the semitendinosus graft is passed through the hole created in the patella and divided into two legs of equal size, which are then taken distally and crossed in an &#x0201c;X fashion,&#x0201d; just below the patellar tendon.</p><p>With the aid of a needled guidewire, the semitendinosus graft traction threads penetrate in opposite directions into the transverse tunnel created in the tibia. After passing the traction threads through the tibial orifice, the &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; figure of the semitendinosus graft is observed. A single-knot suture of the free margins of the graft traction threads is performed to ensure a tight and firm bond to the bone.</p><p>In the next step, a 4.5-mm metallic anchor is inserted centrally in the inferior pole of the patella with the aid of fluoroscopic control, which is necessary for ideal anchor placement. Each anchor has two suture threads.</p><p>The gracilis graft is fixed to the patella with one of the patellar anchor threads, and so it must be divided into two halves of equal size, tied with a simple knot. This step is followed by making three incisions in the remaining patellar tendon with a number 11 scalpel blade, wide enough for the passage of the gracilis graft.</p><p>The first incision should be made just at the bottom, and the others should be spaced approximately 1.5</p><p>cm apart. With the aid of a Kelly forceps, the gracilis graft is pulled through the first proximal orifice.</p><p>After passing through the first orifice, the gracilis graft shifts from the posterior region of the remaining patellar tendon, assuming an anterior position. It is then guided through the other two equidistant orifices in a sequence.</p><p>?In the second orifice, the graft will pass from anterior to posterior. Finally, the most distal extremity of the graft, from posterior to anterior in the distal third of the patellar tendon. Note that the graft should be just placed on the ligament, and it will form the appearance of a &#x0201c;wave&#x0201d; in the lateral view.</p><p>The next step is to perform multiple perforations (3 mm deep with a 2.0-mm drill) below the transverse tunnel created in the tibia, to open a bleeding bed that will receive the patellar tendon distally. In the bleeding site, a 4.5-mm anchor is positioned approximately 1.5</p><p>cm distal to the transverse tibial tunnel, with the aid of fluoroscopy to ensure the correct placement of the tibial anchor.</p><p>With one of the remaining suture threads of the patellar anchor attached to a needle, the semitendinosus graft is sutured together with the lateral edge of the patellar tendon from proximal to distal. The same step is performed with the medial edge of the patellar tendon and the semitendinosus graft medially, using the other leg of the patellar anchor thread.</p><p>Distal fixation of the gracilis graft occurs next. With one of the tibial anchor threads, a Krackow-type suture is performed on both free legs of the graft, so that it is tensioned and fixed tightly to the tibial anchor.</p><p>With the second remaining thread of the tibial anchor, the distal part of the native patellar tendon is reinserted into the tibia. Finally, the lateral and medial patellar retinaculum is sutured with the rest of the tibial anchor threads, starting from distal to proximal.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.mp4"/></supplementary-material>

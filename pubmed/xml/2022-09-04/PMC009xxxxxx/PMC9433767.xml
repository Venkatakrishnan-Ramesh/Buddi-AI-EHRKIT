The ongoing evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has continued to generate new variants. Some have been designated as variants of concern (VOCs) by the World Health Organization (WHO). To better assess the role of imported SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and the prevalence of VOCs in 2021, the genomic surveillance data of SARS-CoV-2 from imported COVID-19 cases of 2021 in the mainland of China were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The analyses included the number of sequence submissions, time of sequence deposition, and time of detection of the VOCs in order to determine the timeliness and sensitivity of the surveillance.

A total of 2,388 sequences with more than 90% genomic coverage were used for lineage analysis. The epidemic trend from Alpha to Delta to Omicron in imported cases was consistent with that in the GISAID. In addition, VOCs from imported cases were usually identified after WHO designation and before causing local outbreaks.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The global distribution of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs changed rapidly in 2021.

The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants may have potential adverse impacts on epidemic traits and severity. To some extent, it is also capable of escaping natural and vaccine-induced immunity (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Some of them were designated as variants of concern (VOCs) by the World Health Organization (WHO) (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, robust surveillance is essential to assess the evolution of viruses in real time.</p><p>After the epidemic in Wuhan City was brought under control in 2020, several COVID-19 outbreaks in the mainland of China have been proven to relate to SARS-CoV-2 contaminated cold-chain products (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), while most were caused by transmission through imported cases on flights, at isolation facilities, or in designated hospitals (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 from imported cases is of great significance for monitoring the risk of different variants that were imported into the mainland of China, assessing the risk of importation-associated domestic spread, and helping guide public health interventions. On March 17, 2020, the China CDC released a notice and launched genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 from imported COVID-19 cases nationwide. The laboratories of provincial CDCs were required to conduct SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing for samples from imported cases and submit the genomic sequences to the China CDC in time. This study includes the analysis of genomic surveillance data of imported SARS-CoV-2 cases of 2021 from the mainland of China.</p><sec id="s01"><title>METHODS</title><p>The sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from laboratories of the provincial CDC were submitted to the China CDC for verification and further analyses. Data from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), China, Macao SAR, China, and Taiwan, China were not included in this study. Global SARS-CoV-2 sequence surveillance data were collected from the Global Initiative of Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) up to March 9, 2022.</p><p>Spatial mapping was conducted to describe the regional distribution of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from imported COVID-19 cases and the timeliness of sequence submission. The standard map [No. GS (2016) 2923] was downloaded without modification from the standard map service website of the National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geographic Information. Lineage analysis was conducted on sequences with genomic coverage above 90%. SARS-CoV-2 lineages were assigned using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages web application (PANGOLIN; version 4.0.5) (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 VOCs were classified according to the WHO&#x02019;s designation (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The proportions of VOCs were calculated based on the date of sample collection. As it takes several days to weeks from sample collection to sequence submission, the number of submitted sequences in December was lower than the actual value.</p></sec><sec id="s02"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of 3,355 imported COVID-19 cases were submitted to the China CDC from January 1 to December 31, 2021 (upon validation, one sequence of them was submitted on December 25, 2020). Except for Xizang (Tibet) Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province, the remaining provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) had sequences submitted in various amounts (<xref rid="Figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The 3 PLADs with the largest submitted sequences were Shanghai Municipality (23.9%, 803/3,355), Yunnan Province (22.9%, 768/3,355), and Guangdong Province (16.9%, 568/3,355), followed by Tianjin Municipality, Fujian Province, Sichuan Province, and Henan Province, which submitted more than 100 sequences each. There were 8 PLADs that submitted 30&#x02013;100 sequences.

The 29 provincial CDCs with the submission of sequences performed well overall in terms of the number and timeliness of sequence submissions, but with different characteristics. Notably, the number of sequence submissions is affected by at least two factors. The first was the number of imported cases. In this regard, Shanghai and Guangdong were the main ports of entry for the mainland of China (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), while Yunnan shares a border with Myanmar and has frequent personnel exchanges. Therefore, these PLADs had a high proportion of imported cases. The second was the viral load of the samples. In general, it is difficult to obtain the viral genome from samples with Ct values higher than 35 (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The epidemic trend from Alpha to Delta to Omicron in imported cases was consistent with that in GISAID. However, the proportions of Beta and Gamma variants imported to the mainland of China were different from those in GISAID, which may be affected in two ways. First, the data in GISAID may be influenced by differences in sampling strategies, sequencing capacities, and data-sharing time between countries (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In contrast to the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants that were globally prevalent, Beta and Gamma variants were mostly prevalent in Africa and South America, respectively (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The relatively low number of uploaded sequences in some African countries may explain the low prevalence of Beta variants in GISAID. Second, surveillance data should be interpreted with consideration of the limitations, including the difference in international communication, the number of imported cases, sequence submission, and sequencing capacities between PLADs.</p><p>Our data showed that the detection of VOCs in imported cases usually occurred after the WHO designation and before the time of local transmission. Early detection of imported vital variants is helpful for timely adjustment of prevention and control strategies and research. Many countries, including China, have strengthened their genomic surveillance to track the emergence of new VOCs in 2021 (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, since 2022, several countries have changed their testing strategies, leading to a decrease in the number of sequences shared with GISAID (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This may have affected the early detection of new VOCs worldwide.

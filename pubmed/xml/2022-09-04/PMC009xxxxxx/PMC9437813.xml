To date, studies have examined intrinsic factors involved in tumor heterogeneity and cancer progression. However, how biological events extrinsically drive cancer development and shape immunosuppressive tumor immunity are still largely unknown. Thus, explicitly understanding the GBM microenvironment and the interplay between diverse cellular compositions will provide new therapeutic avenues for both targeted therapy and immunotherapy.</p><p id="para0011">Macrophages can comprise 30&#x02013;50% of tumor mass,<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> constituting a distinct population with heterogeneous properties in GBM.

Importantly, this binary subset cannot fully capture the complexity of macrophage-mediated immunity in the tumor microenvironment (TME), hence exploring the functional diversity of macrophage subsets remains imperative for promising targets development.</p><p id="para0012">Recently, multi-omics approaches at single-cell resolution have been considered a promising method for tumor biology study. Increasing numbers of single-cell RNA sequencing data have revealed major characteristics of GBM and complex immune microenvironment.<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Here, we analyzed various scRNA-seq data to discover a PN to MES cell state transition regulated by key transcriptional factor (TF)-regulons through trajectory and regulatory network inference. Moreover, using a computational method that predicts the ligands from sender-cell to interact with specific targets from receiver-cell based on gene expression and prior knowledge on regulatory signaling paths, we uncovered glycoprotein nonmetastatic B (GPNMB) derived from macrophages as the top ligand in regulating these TF-regulons implicated in the PN-MES transition.</p><p id="para0013">GPNMB, a transmembrane glycoprotein, presents on the cell surface or resides in endosomes and lysosomes.<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The membrane-bound part can be cleaved by metalloproteinases to produce the soluble isoform,<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> which binds multiple receptors to promote intercellular crosstalk, and its high expression level correlates with therapy resistance in cancer treatment.<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> GPNMB protein was originally discovered in tumor cells and involved in tumor migration, invasion, metastasis,<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> and also immune evasion through directly inhibiting T cell activation.<xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> However, in our study, we show that GPNMB is predominantly expressed on macrophages rather than dendritic or tumor cells in the GBM microenvironment.

For example, <italic>Gpnmb</italic>-high macrophages and DCs expressed high levels of but totally different MHCI/II molecules compared with monocytes, suggesting that in the GBM tumor microenvironment, macrophages and DCs are the dominant antigen-presenting cells.

Our <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies demonstrated that constant exposure of tumor-associated macrophages to proneural type of GBM triggered mesenchymal differentiation. The present study provides clear evidence that extrinsic events can affect the phenotypic plasticity of tumor cells. Furthermore, coupled with modeling intercellular crosstalk by NicheNet method, we investigated potential ligand-receptor-target interactions between tumor and non-tumor cells. Our unbiased analysis uncovered some interesting ligands, such as TGFB1, a master inducer in the mesenchymal transition,<xref rid="bib0059" ref-type="bibr"><sup>59</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr"><sup>60</sup></xref> which can promote the majority of our curative targets. LGALS3, produced by a variety of different cells, including macrophages, and endothelial cells, acts as another major source of this transcriptome change. As shown in our results, mesenchymal regulon expression was induced via integrin B1, the well-known receptor that interacts with LGALS3 as well as CADM1 and PTPRZ1.<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0061" ref-type="bibr"><sup>61</sup></xref> In addition to macrophages, endothelial and transformed endothelial cells played an essential role in the crosstalk.

Our analysis revealed a large number of chemokines involved in this intercellular crosstalk, such as CXCR3, an important modulator of T cell trafficking and activation. Recently, T cell recruitment mediated by CXCR3 has been shown to be required for effective immune checkpoint blockade.<xref rid="bib0068" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref> CXCR3 is highly expressed on T cells and responds to a range of chemokines, such as CXCL9 and CXCL10, which are demonstrated to promote anti-tumor activities by attracting both CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ effector T cells.<xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> CXCL9 and CXCL10 are produced in response to IFN&#x003b3; stimulation,<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref> here, we clearly observe the signal transduction between monocytes and T cells induced by <italic>Infg-Infgr2</italic> interaction.

But one important finding supports our analysis: the interaction between CXCL16+ DCs and CXCR6+ T cells can promote the production of Il15,<xref rid="bib0076" ref-type="bibr"><sup>76</sup></xref> a potent immune-stimulating cytokine that enhances both reactive NK and T cell survival.<xref rid="bib0077" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0078" ref-type="bibr"><sup>78</sup></xref> Consist with our analysis, this <italic>Il15</italic>-<italic>Il2ra/rb</italic> signaling occurs in DC-T cell crosstalk, but not in GPNMB-macrophages.

Another remarkable finding here reveals that GPNMB-macrophage interacts with T cells via H2-t23 and KLrc1/Klrd1. Several studies have suggested that HLA-E (homolog in mice is called Qa-1b, also known as H2-t23) negatively affects IL2 receptor-dependent proliferation and influences IFN&#x003b3;-mediated antitumor responses through binding directly to the NKG2A (encoded by Klrc1)/CD94 (encoded by Klrd1) receptor on tumor-specific T cells.<xref rid="bib0079" ref-type="bibr"><sup>79</sup></xref> Additionally, current therapeutic vaccines that block NKG2A with Qa-1 can enhance CD8+ T cells immunity.<xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr"><sup>80</sup></xref> NK- and T-cell mediated anti-tumor effects were also promoted by an anti-NKG2A monoclonal antibody.<xref rid="bib0081" ref-type="bibr"><sup>81</sup></xref> All of this suggests that this particular macrophage subset may attract T cells to tumor sites through competitive <italic>Cxcl16-Cxcr6</italic> interaction with DCs; however, this interaction may not be able to induce co-stimulatory signals, but rather impair T cell function through CD94/NKG2A-MHC interactions. Our immunofluorescence staining verified the co-localization of GPNMB-macrophages and T cells, and ex-vivo isolation of GPNMB-high macrophages cannot activate T cells as dendritic cells or even GPNMB-low macrophages did (Supplementary Figure 3b), all of which fully support these findings conducted from the comprehensive analysis. Besides, our data also suggest that in the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated dendritic cells still possess the ability but maybe not the chance to activate T cells, this <italic>in situ</italic> antigen presentation can be enhanced when T cells either gain more mobility or decrease the retention with non-effective interaction.</p><p id="para0047">We thoroughly compared the MES- and PN-tumor microenvironment and showed the higher infiltration of T cells accompanied by macrophages and endothelial cells. The correlation was also supported by deconvolution of bulk-seq, spatial scRNA-seq as well as in flow cytometry analysis of the single-cell immune profiling on syngeneic GBM mouse model, while another group obtained the same results.<xref rid="bib0082" ref-type="bibr"><sup>82</sup></xref> Taken together, this raised an important question that why MES-subtype GBM has more T cell infiltration: (1) Can monocytes/macrophages release signals for T cells recruitment solely before entering tumor sites? (2) or T cells and macrophages are both attracted by endothelial cells at the vascular niche, where more vessels are present in MES subtype. As a result, simply targeting monocyte/macrophage depletion or anti-angiogenesis therapy may affect T cell recruitment to some extent. Interestingly, knockdown of GPNMB in macrophages did not reverse immunosuppressive phenotype, as shown by unchanged CD206 expression (Supplementary Figure 4), a classic M2 macrophage marker, indicating that GPNMB is not a driving factor in alternative macrophage polarization.</p><p id="para0048">Thus, we proposed that in further study, depletion of this subset will be the best therapeutic option for sufficient release of T cells to exert its function when encountering dendritic cells as well as preventing the transcriptomic transition of GBM into a high-grade mesenchymal phenotype. In summary, our integrative analyses suggest that targeting GPNMB-high macrophages can reshape a favorable and sensitive tumor microenvironment for future combination therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec0035"><title>Contributors</title><p id="para0054">A.X. and J.Z. performed and analyzed most of experiments.

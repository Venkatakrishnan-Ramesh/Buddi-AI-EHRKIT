Prevention of tooth loss can be done in clinical settings, community settings, and through national policies. Saliva plays an important role in eating, swallowing, and protecting oral mucosa from pathogens. The major causes of dry mouth are polypharmacy and the use of anticholinergic medications among older people. Public health actions to promote collaboration between dentists and doctors in the adjustment of drug prescriptions are warranted. Oral cancer can affect oral function largely both from the disease itself and from cancer treatments due to the destruction of oral structures and salivary gland function. Tobacco use and alcohol consumption are major risk factors for oral cancer; they also contribute to various systemic diseases and cancers of other organs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Public health policies and interventions using the common risk factor approaches to tackle tobacco and alcohol consumption should be encouraged.

A key behavioural risk factor in tooth loss is tobacco use, whilst poor oral hygiene, excessive use of alcohol, overweight, and high blood sugar are considered to be other modifiable risk factors.<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p id="para0004">A key component to tooth loss prevention is a shift from treating disease to instituting effective prevention strategies.<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> This preventive approach to caries and periodontal disease management should be integrated into routine dental services. For older adults at high caries risk, preventative regimes should include oral hygiene instruction, assisted toothbrushing, daily toothbrushing with a high-fluoride-containing dentifrice, professionally applied fluoride varnish/solutions, and daily chlorhexidine mouthwash.<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> For older adults, powered toothbrushes can also be a good alternative to manual plaque control, particularly where manual dexterity is compromised.<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p id="para0005">Poor oral health is a very common problem for older adults living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs).<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> The majority of older adults within LTCFs now retain their natural teeth, giving rise to a partially dentate population. The oral health of LTCF residents is much worse than their community-dwelling peers, as highlighted by caries prevalence data.<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Oral care strategies for this population should focus on preventing disease and reducing pain and comorbidities.<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> However, evidence for interventions on promoting oral health amongst LTCF residents is weak.<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> In the United Kingdom, national guidelines were published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2016 that aim to maintain and improve the oral health of care home residents.<xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Unfortunately, a report by the Care Quality Commission in 2019 stated that 73% of United Kingdom LTCF residents&#x02019; care plans either did not include or did not adequately address oral health; 52% of LTCFs had no oral health care policy; and 47% did not provide oral health training for staff.<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Recent co-design work undertaken with LTCF staff and residents has developed a series of innovative resources to support oral care within LTCFs.

Oral health care system modifications by establishing outreach services (eg, use of mobile dental units or portable equipment) and the use of teledentistry, particularly mHealth (messages and apps), can also facilitate and ensure that effective services are delivered to older adults.<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> These innovative approaches have been particularly welcome during the COVID-19 pandemic due to restrictions to care facilities.</p><p id="para0008">National oral health guidelines focused on preventing chronic dental diseases are essential, and health authorities are thus urged to formulate oral health goals, targets, and oral health standards in measurable terms for older adults. The public health approach to prevent oral diseases is considered in 3 core activities: assessment, policy development, and assurance/insurance.<xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> For older adults, appropriate oral health surveillance systems should be established for measuring progress in oral health prevention and promotion.<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Regarding the policy development activity, national evidence-based public health programmes&#x02019; implementation should be advocated, and the life-course perspective for achieving better oral health, oral function, and quality of life must be considered in national guidelines and policies. National policy-related initiatives such as the US Medicare programme and 8020 campaign in Japan are promising oral health promotional efforts for older adults. Revisions to existing older adult insurance schemes and the introduction of financially fair oral care programmes should be an urgent priority in order to eliminate financial barriers exacerbating oral health inequalities amongst older adults.<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec0003"><title>Hyposalivation</title><p id="para0009">In maintaining good oral health and oral function, saliva plays multiple roles. It helps prevent dental caries through bacterial agglutination and removal from the oral cavity and also helps with speech functions.<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Saliva has a vital role in mastication because it is involved in chewing and swallowing through food maceration and bolus formation.<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Saliva dissolves taste substances in the food and enables taste perception. Additionally, it contains specific digestive enzymes to support food digestion such as amylase, lipase, and proteases and immunoglobulins to defend against external pathogens including as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.</p><p id="para0010">Compared with standard quantity salivation, hyposalivation is the objective reduction of salivary secretion, and it negatively impacts oral function by disturbing saliva functions. In a recent meta-analysis amongst older adults, the global prevalence of hyposalivation was estimated to be 20.0%.<xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> The most common aetiology of hyposalivation is as a medication side effect, especially in older adults who are more likely to be taking multiple drugs to manage a range of chronic systemic diseases.<xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Salivary gland dysfunction and hyposalivation can be induced by the majority of prescription medications, but this effect is most pronounced with drugs including diuretics, beta blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants. Other causes of hyposalivation include radiation therapy to the head and neck region; systemic diseases including Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes mellitus; and salivary gland disorders caused by trauma and oncology.<xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p><p id="para0011">There is limited published evidence focused on prevention of hyposalivation, especially through public health interventions. To the best of our knowledge, in older adults, only one systematic review has been published with a meta-analysis focussed on the effects of oral health programmes on hyposalivation.<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> This review reported that completion of oral health promotion programmes was effective in improving salivary secretion rates amongst older adults. The oral health promotion programmes included oral exercises, toothbrushing, and salivary massage. The programmes were delivered to a group of participants by dental hygienists, nurses, dentists, and occupational therapists through lectures, videos, handouts, and demonstrations.</p><p id="para0012">With more than 95% of cases of dry mouth (including hyposalivation) derived from medication usage, there is a need to raise awareness of the role of polypharmacy with pharmacists and other health practitioners including doctors and nurses. Polypharmacy reduction is thus a possible alternative method for preventing medication-induced hyposalivation. With an ageing population around the world, the prevalence of polypharmacy-induced xerostomia is expected to increase amongst older adults. Therefore, for pharmacists and other health practitioners, especially physicians, further education on the role of polypharmacy in hyposalivation should be provided.<xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> Additionally, early hyposalivation detection allows for early resolution of the condition and less suffering to patients, thus leading to prevention of negative impact on oral functions. Therefore, in patients with hyposalivation, oral health practitioners should be educated in recognising the clinical oral signs of hyposalivation (<xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table</xref>).

Therefore, prevention and early detection of oral cancer is crucial.</p><p id="para0015">Educating the public and raising awareness about major risk factors and high-risk behaviours for oral cancer are vitally important. Raising public awareness of the harm, especially on oral health, caused by tobacco products should be encouraged via advertisement and campaigns and promoting smoking cessation support. The MPOWER measures introduced by the World Health Organisation (WHO) are useful to evaluate the progress of each tobacco control policy<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref> and consist of 6 components: (1) monitoring tobacco use; (2) protecting people from tobacco smoke; (3) offering help to quit tobacco; (4) warning about the dangers of tobacco; (5) enforcing tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship bans; and (6) raising taxes on tobacco.<xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> In the same way, health care professionals have a responsibility to encourage the implementation of public policies to reduce harmful alcohol use. The WHO recommends the following strategies: regulating alcoholic beverage marketing (especially to young people), reducing demand through taxation and pricing mechanisms, raising awareness of public health issues caused by harmful alcohol use, and ensuring support for effective alcohol policies.<xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Further public health interventions, including administration of the HPV vaccine, may protect against oropharyngeal cancers.</p><p id="para0016">Delayed health services consultation is considered to be a major factor for late diagnosis, which may lead to poor postoperative outcomes and further oral functional decline. This may be due to low oral cancer awareness, and raising the profile of oral cancer is an important goal. There are many population-based oral cancer awareness campaigns (eg, World Cancer Day) organised by international or national organisations and local communities. These campaigns can play a role in improving people's knowledge and motivation. However, longer-term impacts associated with increased service access and oral cancer diagnosis at an earlier stage have yet to be demonstrated.<xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> National oral cancer screening programmes are also less common but do exist in some countries, with positive results.<xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> There are insufficient data available to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of national screening programmes; however, there is evidence indicating that community-based oral cancer screening is effective in high-risk populations, such as tobacco users, and in developing countries where there is a high oral cancer incidence.<xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> A self-check tool, Mouth Self-Examination (MSE), has been shown to be effective with high specificity for detecting oral malignant and/or premalignant lesions.<xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> MSE consists of tactile perception and sense of sight checklists, and users can check with their hands and a mirror briefly for any findings that suggest cancerous or precancerous lesions.

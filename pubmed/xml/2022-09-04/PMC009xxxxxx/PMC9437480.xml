<italic toggle="yes">The COVID-19 pandemic challenges the public health sectors worldwide.
The contagious rate of the COVID-19 virus is significantly high and causes
huge deaths. One of the reasons for this high contagious rate is the rapid
development of physical communication worldwide. It is important to find the
gaps in the health management sectors to stop the outbreaks. In this paper,
we have investigated the obstacles in the health management sectors in
Bangladesh to combat this pandemic. Furthermore, a bunch of work planes has
been recommended to tackle the current COVID-19 pandemic based on the
investigated obstacles which will significantly improve the public health
sectors in this country.</italic>

</p><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-jphr.2021.26271"><title>Introduction</title><p>Across various countries around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the
holes in the existing healthcare systems to combat the epidemic. Disparities
regarding income and number of physicians along with factors like heart disease,
diabetes, obesity, and smoking habit were spotted to be significantly correlated
with COVID-19 death cases across various counties in the USA.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> It was estimated that the COVID-19 would reduce the average life expectancy
by almost three years, while every one million deaths would cost the economy by six
to ten trillion dollars in the long run.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> The frequency of positively detected COVID-19 cases was projected to be
lesser in various low-income countries where the ratio of older people was on the
lower side.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> The infection rate in younger age groups encompassing more than eighty
percent of the total population has been the maximum across SAARC nations.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr4-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</sup></p><p>The results of a separate study revealed that a delimited epidemic could considerably
affect the overall economy of a low-income country inclosing poor healthcare
facilities and high population density.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr5-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
</sup> The pandemic may also persuade labor paucity and an alteration to more
counteractive savings as well.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr6-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</sup> Although the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 will get reversed at
some stage due to the cyclical nature of the economy, the epidemic would decelerate
the existing socio-demographic trends to some extent across countries.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup></p><p>The socioeconomic position and educational level of the parents had significant
effects on their children's education throughout the lockdown enforced by the government.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr8-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
</sup> Although children are nominally vulnerable to COVID-19, being confined at
homes for such a long period of time without school and outdoor activities would not
only raise boredom, agony, edginess, infuriation, and wide-ranging psychological
problems among them, but also upset their regular lifestyle.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The findings of a separate
study showed that the epidemic would not only have considerable effects on
children's education and welfare but also broaden the inequalities between
privileged and underprivileged children in accessing education.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr11-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup></p><p>Any epidemic would instigate some indirect negative consequences on reproductive
health due to the additional burden on the existing health care facilities
accompanied by deteriorated gender inequalities.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="bibr13-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr14-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr15-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The supply of various
contraceptives has been continuously being interrupted because of the lockdown
measures taken for controlling the COVID-19.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr16-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, services like abortion are not being possible in many instances
due to the lock-down.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr18-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The BCG vaccine was observed to minimize the frequency of
COVID-19 cases.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr19-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> Hence, the countries lacking extensive BCG immunization coverage were
affected more by the COVID-19.<sup>

</sup></p><p>In this pandemic, health workers including doctors (physicians), nurses, medical
technicians, hospital staffs are the major front fighters against the COVID-19
virus. Their physical health safety and most importantly mental healthcare play a
significantly vital role to combat this current pandemic. Htay <italic toggle="yes">et

and found 60% of the participants suffering anxiety and 53% of them are in
depression due to the current pandemic. In another study, Htay <italic toggle="yes">et

mental health challenges throughout this current pandemic. They reported 70% of them
getting family supports and having positive thinking, 58.4% of them having a
religious belief, and 48.2% of them having sleep and food to cope with the COVID-19
pandemic. Marzo <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup>

</sup> performed a survey regarding psychological distress among Bangladeshi people
during this pandemic and reported that 44.3% of the participants were drowning in
mild to moderate distress while 9.5% were in severe distress. Moreover, the overall
mental health issues among the health workers in different countries as well as in
Bangladesh are significantly highlighted in many other studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="bibr24-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr25-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>In Bangladesh, proper arrangements to ensure apposite quarantine facilities were
absent right from the beginning of the pandemic. Inadequate testing of COVID-19,
incomplete investigation and improper treatment of the infected cases, and
insufficient protection equipment were some of the notable deficiencies. COVID-19
was fearful and panic among the people which was observed about the lockdown during
the month of March 2020. That situation changed gradually. After a certain time,
people returned to their normal daily activities. But the tendency of subsequential
overlooking of this disease became anxious in the changing situation. In this paper,
we investigate the obstacles faced by the government of Bangladesh to protect people
from the COVID-19 pandemic and advocate some policies to tackle such type of sudden
pandemic in the future. Moreover, to understand the overall pandemic scenario in
Bangladesh, the number of infected people against the number of testes on daily
basis has been highlighted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jphr.2021.26271"><title>Design and Methods</title><sec id="sec3-jphr.2021.26271"><title>Sources of the data</title><p>The data for the number of daily COVID-19 infected patients and the number of

collected the sample and diagnosed it uniquely. As a result, the institution
faced a lot of pressure because its capacity was less by comparing the
necessity in the case of collecting samples and testing COVID-19. A lot of
samples for testing were stored in the middle of the year 2020 due to the
delay in expanding the facility of labs and testing equipment. The situation
became worst in the middle of April in 2020 due to the lack of skilled
manpower. Besides, the speed of work and quality of sample collection were
reduced in many areas when medical technologists were affected rapidly. More

<xref rid="bibr30-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</sup> The health facilities are not quite adequate for the 163 million people
of this country. There are only 5.4 health workers per 10000 people including
doctors, nurses, and staff available with 35% vacancy in sanctioned health
worker positions.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr31-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</sup> Clearly, it is insufficient to ensure proper health management in normal
circumstances, while the COVID-19 pandemic creates unendurable pressure in this
sector. Till now there are only 4237 general beds and 355 ICU beds are available
which can not cover the COVID-19 crisis period.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr31-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
</sup> In this study, poor management in the health sector has been identified
during the pandemic including lack of health workforce, lack of hospital and
treatment facilities, miss management and crisis on sample collection and
testing of suspected COVID-19 patients, lack of quarantine and isolation
facility, unsafe workplace for the health workers, etc. Since the manpower was
not sufficient to tackle the pandemic, the government recruited a number of
health workers to resolve this problem although still there is a deficiency.

<xref rid="bibr26-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

of suitable swab sticks for testing in the first week of April and May 2020.<sup>

</sup> According to the rules, the swab should be pushed and kept in the nose
for few seconds so that the swab is wet by the internal immune liquid which was
not followed properly due to the lack of trained health workers. The sample
preserving tube should be marked by the patients' name, ID
(<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, medical record no.), address, and the date of sample
collection. But it was not maintained properly in the early few months of the
pandemic.</p><p>In the early stage of the pandemic, the concept of quarantine and isolation was
quite new and was not clear to the people. Due to the lack of accommodation for
the suspected and affected people to ensure quarantine and isolation by the
management of the government, people were enforced to do quarantine and
isolation in their own homes. It was not possible to keep the consistency in
ensuring quarantine and isolation facilities at that time. Keeping
standardization in nursing was not noticed due to limitations of quarantine and
isolation facilities. Some difficulties are identified regarding quarantine and
isolation in our study in the early few months of the pandemic. It was observed
that the patient and their family member did not maintain properly the rules of
quarantine and isolation. The public and local administrations had a lack of
coordination between them. Moreover, an inadequate supply of food, medicine, and
other essential commodities has been shown in the quarantine and isolation.</p></sec><sec id="sec12-jphr.2021.26271"><title>Uncertainty on medication of COVID-19</title><p>At the beginning of the pandemic, the treatment of COVID-19 was not introduced
worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) was not determined the proper
treatment in the early pandemic. That is why people were trying and taking
different types of unauthorized medication. Also, due to the lack of treatment
facilities in the hospitals of Bangladesh, the majority of COVID-19 were not
interested to go to the hospital. Rather, affected people took different types
of medications like allopathic, supplementary, herbal, and local treatment.
After that, the issue of the vitamin would come-Vitamin A, B, and C. Among
these, vitamin C was most preferable (78%), 66% of patients took Azithromycin,
10% took Doxycycline and 9% were involved Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine.<sup>

homeopathy and 2% allopathy in parallel herbal treatment. Some patients took
antibiotics besides different types of supplementary food such as lemon, orange,
extra protein. Even some people acquired different kinds of unproven and
unauthorized but popular home treatment, for example, gurgle by warm water with
zinger (84%), taking a steam breath (79%), drinking warm water (76%). During the

tackle a massive sudden disaster. Moreover, it teaches us how to prepare
ourselves in the future to fight any pandemic. Based on the experiences we have
faced during the pandemic and the obstacles we identified in this study, here we
present some essential recommendations to overcome this challenge in the future:
i) it is very essential to establish a national health policy to tackle a sudden
pandemic; ii) the government should have to recover the deficit of skilled
manpower and equipment in connection with health services as well as increase
medical technologists and supply PCR machines sufficiently to the hospitals all
over the country; iii) all health workers must be trained up to collect and test
the samples perfectly; iv) it must be ensured and monitored that the
responsibility of all health workers who are directly connected with the
treatment and testing of the patients is fulfilled properly; v) the government
must have an awareness program to deliver the correct information about the
virus, cautions, proper treatment procedures to the nation; vi) ensure
sufficient quarantine and isolation facilities all over the country; vii)
strictly maintain the quarantine for the migrated people, immigrants, and
tourists traveling in this country; viii) ensure and increase the Intensive Care
Unit (ICU) facilities to all the hospitals especially in rural areas; ix)
monitoring systems should be strict and strong for controlling the medicine
sector; x) ensure the reservation of the emergency and essential medical
equipment for the pandemic situation; xi) deserve a disaster management fund in
the national fiscal budget; xii) to grow the consciousness of any pandemic to
our next generation, it is essential to include the necessary information in the
education system.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5-jphr.2021.26271"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Distribution of manpower recruitment for COVID-19 in Bangladesh</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.4081_jphr.2021.26271-fig5" position="float"/><attrib>[Source: IEDCR].</attrib></fig><fig position="float" id="fig6-jphr.2021.26271"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Different types of medications (%) at the early stage of COVID-19 in

centuries.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-jphr.2021.26271" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> But none of them spread worldwide at a pace similar to the
COVID-19. The development of the communication system is one of the reasons to
spread infectious viruses worldwide. It is not possible to deny the chances of
happening this type of pandemic in the future. Therefore, to protect humankind from
this pandemic in the future, we have to learn from the current obstacles and
mistakes. In this paper, we analyzed and identified the obstacles to protect people
from the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Also, the current situation of the
pandemic has been shown by analyzing the number of affected people against the
number of tested people. In this study, it is observed that the deficit of the
necessary medical equipment related to COVID-19 testing and treatment, poor
management of patients, delaying the required actions to protect the pandemic, and
the uncertainty in the medication system were the major obstacles during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, several recommendations are proposed to tackle the rest
of the pandemic and as well for the future. Further study can be done in the future
by observing the COVID-19 pandemic until it will cure permanently and also,
observing the situation in other countries.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-jphr.2021.26271"><p><bold>Contributions:</bold> All authors have equal intellectual contributions to

An anonymous survey using SurveyMonkey&#x000ae; on vaccination uptake rates, responses, and attitudes was available to Student, Graduate, and Registered Respiratory Therapists in Canada from July to October of 2021. A total of 1066 surveys (8.4% of target population) were started, 983 in English and 83 in French with 1013 completed fully and included in the data analysis. Canadian RT Vaccination uptake rates were compared to those of all Canadian healthcare workers which showed that 90.42% of the surveyed RT population in Canada received their vaccination right away compared to the posted rate at the time of 86.27% for all Canadian Healthcare Workers.</p><p>Pearson Chi-Square Tests were performed to evaluate association between vaccination status and other categorical parameters evaluated in the survey. There was a significant (<italic>P = 0.013</italic>) association between early vaccination and age, a significant (<italic>P = 0.036</italic>) association between vaccination status and participants&#x02019; response on whether or not they have a family member or know someone who has had COVID-19, a significant (<italic>P &#x0003c; 0.001</italic>) association between vaccination status and attitudes towards trusting science to develop safe, effective, new vaccines, and a significant (<italic>P &#x0003c; 0.001</italic>) association between vaccination status and attitudes towards trusting the Ministry of Health to ensure that vaccines are safe. There was no significant association between vaccination status and gender, province/territory of residency/work, level of education, level of involvement with COVID-19 patients. The results suggest that the RT groups across Canada had higher early vaccination uptake rates than the general Healthcare worker groups and that age, relationship to people with COVID-19 and trust in science played a significant role in their vaccination uptake rates.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></sub-article><sub-article article-type="abstract" id="sub-2"><front><journal-meta><journal-id journal-id-type="nlm-ta">Can J Respir Ther</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="iso-abbrev">Can J Respir Ther</journal-id><journal-id journal-id-type="publisher-id">CJRT</journal-id><journal-title-group><journal-title>Canadian Journal of Respiratory Therapy: CJRT = Revue Canadienne de la Th&#x000e9;rapie Respiratoire : RCTR</journal-title></journal-title-group><issn pub-type="ppub">1205-9838</issn><issn pub-type="epub">2368-6820</issn><publisher><publisher-name>Canadian Society of Respiratory Therapists</publisher-name></publisher></journal-meta><article-meta><article-id pub-id-type="pmc">PMC9382903</article-id><article-categories><subj-group subj-group-type="heading"><subject>Student Category Winner</subject></subj-group></article-categories><title-group><article-title>EFFECTIVENESS OF VAPING VS COUNSELLING ON SMOKING CESSATION</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Floro</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lam</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author" corresp="yes"><name><surname>Paul</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peacock</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>The Michener Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada</aff></contrib-group><author-notes><corresp id="cor2">

It is further complicated by the addictive nature of nicotine. The addictive mechanism is facilitated by cigarette smoke that carries nicotine deep into the lungs to elicit a release of dopamine in the brain. The efficacy of nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) and behavioural counselling (BC) were compared in actively smoking adults aged 18&#x02013;40 that achieved smoking cessation for at least 6 months. The novel E-cigarette devices (ECs also known as vapes) is an NRT that was investigated. A literature search was performed using the Pubmed and Cochrane Library using keywords such as: smoking cessation, vaping, behavioural therapy, individual counselling, etc. Ten articles were selected for this review based on relevancy to participant eligibility, strength and scope of the article, and recency (within 5 years of search). In the literature, ECs led to higher quit rates than other NRT, especially for smokers with high nicotine dependency. However, there are concerns about the side effects and long-term health risks of EC use. BC has strong evidence of effectiveness with no documented side effects. These results can inform evidence-based practices for health care providers working with smoking cessation techniques but there is currently a gap in the literature that directly compares BC and ECs. A cost benefit analysis of effectiveness and side effects for each smoking cessation technique should be evaluated prior to implementation, as each patient is unique. Further research would provide supporting data for smoking cessation options, and strengthen recommendations for healthcare providers.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></sub-article></article>

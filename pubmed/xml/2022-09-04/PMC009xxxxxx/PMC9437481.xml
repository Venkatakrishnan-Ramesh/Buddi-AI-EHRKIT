<italic toggle="yes">The impacts of COVID-19 associated with adverse psychological impacts
among the general public become important global public health thread.
Therefore, this study is very crucial for the country like Myanmar, which
conveys the betterment in planning the preventive and control measures
together with physical, social, and mental support to people who are
directly and indirectly affected by COVID-19. The highlight and priority
should be given to develop better strategies to self-employed groups and
poor people for their support, relief, and resettlement of their ruined

</p><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-jphr.2021.2279"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health threat. On
30<sup>th</sup> January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)
Director-General declared that the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern (PHEIC).<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> At that time, there were no cases of COVID 19 in Myanmar; pandemic was
confirmed to have reached Myanmar on 23<sup>rd</sup> of March 2020.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr2-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</sup> According to 25<sup>th</sup> May 2020 update from Ministry of Health and
Support (MOHS) in Myanmar, there were 203 confirmed cases and among them, 60.6%
recovered and fatality rate was 3%.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup></p><p>Since COVID-19 pandemic is the public health emergency of international concern, such
pandemic situations were associated with adverse psychological impacts among general
public globally.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> This pandemic has
caused people to feel a variety of psychological distress which includes
anxiousness, wariness, fear of contracting the virus by them or by their family
members, isolation and quarantine measures-related anxiety and stress disorders,
distress due to separation of family members, fear of longer term impacts of the
global pandemics, and many other reasons.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Therefore, the International
Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) implemented some psychological support activities such
as specific COVID-19 support activities through community engagement, remote
technical and psychological support to frontline workers and volunteers responding
to COVID-19 pandemic, sharing of materials on enduring with anxiety, stress, and
stigma, and adaptation to current COVID-19 pandemic situation in many different
countries, etc.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> WHO and public
health authorities developed a series of conveying messages to different target
groups including general population, healthcare workers, team leaders or managers in
health facilities, children, and older adults with underlying health conditions, etc.;<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup> These messages can be used in communications to support mental and
psychological well-being to minimize psychological impact due to COVID-19 through
multisectoral collaborations in many different countries.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr1-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</sup></p><p>Furthermore, a review of related literature suggested that Myanmar will require close
coordination among military, ethnic armed groups, and government to combat COVID-19
through prevention and control measures within community level. <sup>
<xref rid="bibr7-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</sup></p><p>Studies have shown that there were many psychological consequences associated with
COVID-19 pandemic such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD), anxiety,
depression, somatic complaints, and nightmares.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr10-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
</sup> Other studies have mentioned that people in China suffered 16.5% of moderate
to severe depressive symptoms, 28.8% of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, and
8.1% of moderate to severe psychological stress due to COVID-19 crisis situation.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr11-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
</sup> During January 2020 in Myanmar, the prevalence of mental distress occupied
18.0%, where female respondents occupy a higher cut with 21.2% compared to male
respondents with 14.9%.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr3-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless, there was no enough published information regarding the
psychological impact and mental health problems among civilizations worldwide
especially in Myanmar. There were only few articles that can be found which examine
the psychological impacts of COVID-19 for the general population above 16 years of
age.</p><p>Therefore, the study aims to estimate the prevalence of psychological distress and to
identify the predictors associated with psychological distress due to COVID-19
pandemic among Burmese. This study may assist government, non-government
organizations, and healthcare agencies for implementing programs and taking care of
psychological well-being of the community during and after COVID-19 pandemic in
Myanmar and other parts of the world.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jphr.2021.2279"><title>Design and Methods</title><p>An internet-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from March to April 2020
during the movement restriction took place. Snowball sampling, a type of convenience
sampling method was used for the data collection using research networks of
universities, hospitals, friends and their relatives. The criteria of selecting the
participants was that only those adults who were 18 years old and above and resides
in Myanmar for a minimum of one week during the COVID-19 pandemic announcement made
by the WHO were considered. The structured online questionnaires were conveniently
distributed through emails, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other social media throughout
this network in Myanmar.</p><p>Data collection started 2 weeks after the announcement by the WHO that COVID-19 was
pandemic. The online link was available for about 1 month. Our study was an online
survey which was completely voluntary. The consented participants were able to
respond only once using a single account by setting the feature to prevent more than
one response from the same history. The participants were asked to give a response
based on their previous one week experience. Spreadsheets responses were exported
into IBM SPSS version 25 for further analysis. Overall response rate of the survey
was 38%.</p><p>In this study, COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) was used to measure the
psychological distress due to COVID-19.</p><p>The Cronbach's alpha coefficient of CPDI Myanmar version was 0.852.</p><p>The data were organized and processed through Microsoft Excel. Regarding COVID-19
Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), the total score was computed and categorized
into three categories such as normal (&#x0003c;28), mild to moderate distress (28-51),
and severe distress (&#x02265;52). For data analysis, SPSS version 18 was used. Descriptive
statistics such as frequency and percentage were calculated for categorical data
while mean, standard deviation, and range were calculated for quantitative
variables. Bar Chart was used to describe the prevalence of psychological distress.
Chi-square test of goodness-of-fit was calculated to determine if the distribution
of psychological distress due to COVID-19 was different. Chi-Square test of
association was calculated to determine the association between demographic
variables and psychological distress due to COVID-19. Multiple Logistic Regression
was used to determine the predictors of psychological distress due to COVID-19 and
logistic model was used to predict the probability of having distress. For Logistic
Regression Analysis, we dichotomized the psychological distress into normal and
distressed. Odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval were calculated. Level of
significance was set at 0.05. The Receiver-Operating Characteristics (ROC) was
constructed and sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and
Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of prediction model were calculated. The area under
curve (AUC) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were calculated. To determine the best
cut-off probability, we calculated Youden Index J=maxc{Se(c)+Sp(c)-1} in which Se is
sensitivity and Sp is specificity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-jphr.2021.2279"><title>Results</title><p>There were 530 participants in this study. 29.8% of the participants were less than
30 years of age, 47.7% were 30 to 45 years old, and 20.8% were above 45 years. 42.8%

participants whose age lies under 30 years were distressed, 58.7% of 30-45 years,
and 76.8% of age above 45 years had a similar response (p=0.003). Regarding race,
76.5% of other races had distress while 56.3% of Burma were distressed (p&#x0003c;0.001).
81.5% of other religions were distressed while 58.4% of Buddhist were distressed

J=maxc{Se(c)+Sp(c)-1} in which Se is sensitivity and Sp is specificity and selected
the cut-off probability where this value was maximized. In our study, the best
cut-off probability of the prediction model was 0.663, where the sensitivity,

distress while 62.6% experienced mild to moderate (55.6%) and severe (7%)
psychological distress. (<xref rid="fig1-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="fig">Figure

<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic><sup>
<xref rid="bibr12-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> where they showed that 35% of the respondents experienced psychological
distress (29.29% of the respondents' scores were between 28 and 51, and 5.14% of the
respondents' scores were &#x02265;52). Similar to a study in Myanmar, a study in Spain<sup>
<xref rid="bibr13-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
</sup> showed that 72.0% had psychological distress. This study<sup>
<xref rid="bibr14-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
</sup> found that COVID-19-related psychological distress includes not only anxiety
and fear, but also suspicion. Suspicion is believed to be a psychological defence
mechanism that is subconsciously developed by the general public in the face of
infectious diseases.</p><p>In Myanmar, 59.6% of participants who were under 30 years old had distress while
76.8% of those who are above 45 years of age had the same response (p=0.003). This
is similar to the findings in a study of Qiu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr12-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
</sup> However, their study showed that people under 18 years had the lowest CPDI
scores. Respondents under 18 years of age is not included in the criteria of this
study. Individuals between 18 and 30 years of age or above 60 presented the highest
CPDI which is similar in both studies.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr15-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</sup> Two major protective factors may explain the low distress level in juveniles:
a relatively low morbidity rate among this age group, and limited exposure to the
epidemic due to home quarantine. Higher scores among the young adult group (18&#x02013;30
years) seem to confirm findings from previous studies that young people tend to
obtain a large amount of information from social media that can easily trigger stress.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr16-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</sup> Since the highest mortality rate is seen among the elderly during the
epidemic, it is not surprising that elderly people are more likely to be
psychologically impacted.</p><p>In a study in Myanmar, the prevalence of distress was highest among those who have a
middle-school- and lower level-education (91.3%), followed by high school level
(79.1%), vocational school (61%), and graduate/postgraduate level of education
(56.2%, p&#x0003c;0.001). The latter finding contrasts another study which states that
people with higher education tended to have more distress, probably because of high
self-awareness of their health.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr17-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
</sup> In Myanmar, when compared to employee, the chances of having distress were
significantly lower among students (but significantly higher among those who were
self-employed, <xref rid="table3-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).
During a lockdown period, the wellbeing of the self-employed, low earning employees,
daily wagers, and farm workers might be affected due to the loss of income.</p><p>In a study in China, it is noteworthy that migrant workers experienced the highest
level of distress among all occupations. The concern about virus exposure in public
transportation when returning to work, their worries about delays in work time and
subsequent deprivation of their anticipated income may explain the high stress level.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr18-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
</sup> The COVID-19 pandemic is undoubtedly a stressful event for the general public
which can cause mental health problems among the public. There are many studies
which support that COVID-19 crisis can lead to a dysfunctional anxiety among the
general public. In order to measure the public's fear of COVID 19 in Iran, Ahorsu
<italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> compiled and developed &#x0201c;the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S).&#x0201d;<sup>
<xref rid="bibr19-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</sup> This scale is proven to have a good reliability and validity in the
evaluation of the Turkish general public.</p><p>Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability in the transmission, complications and
course of the disease, public fear of COVID 19 is likely to prevail. It can lead to
psychological distress with mal-adaptive behaviours, and negative reaction among
common people.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr20-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
</sup> During a pandemic, news of a few deaths, increase in number of new cases, and
spread of fake news in social media can heighten people's fears, frustrations,
doubts, and anxiety over the crisis. The uncertain policy and public health seeking
behaviours may lead to conflicts between clinicians and patients which can hamper
the pandemic control programs and may render social instability.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Viral fake news on social media
can also have some deleterious effects on control and outcomes of the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19)pandemic.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="bibr24-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr25-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In Myanmar, this
unwarranted menace was dispelled to a great extent by an online live speech of the
Myanmar's leader, the State Counsellor herself, on Facebook, clarifying the policy,
quarantine procedures and treatment strategies, and discussions with the front line
healthcare service providers. Definitely this had helped to allay the anxiety of the
public and this is reflected in the findings of the study, <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> the
majority of the participants have none or minimal psychological distress especially
among the educated citizens residing in Yangon region (<xref rid="table3-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, there are a lot of festivals and people who live happily in contentment
and generosity in Myanmar. Burmese enjoy charity work and help the needy people
especially during crisis and disaster. This tremendous community support can be
considered as a protective factor against the fear of coronavirus (COVID-19)
pandemic. Moreover, the majority of the responders in this survey are Buddhists
(82.2%, <xref rid="table1-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). 41.6% of
the Buddhists did not have distress as compared to 81.4% of other religions (<xref rid="table3-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The Buddhists are
accustomed to Vipassana Meditation, a variant of mindful meditation that is found to
relieve physical and psychological impact of stress.<sup>
<xref rid="bibr26-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</sup> A study in Myanmar revealed that the prevalence of distress was higher among
non-healthcare personnel (67.4%) than healthcare personnel (45.5%) (p&#x0003c;0.001,
<xref rid="table3-jphr.2021.2279" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This is in

</sup> He had analysed data of 78 nurses in Karachi, Pakistan who were directly

</sup> has reported that there are differential levels of psychological distress in
patients who experienced COVID-19 infection, individuals under quarantine, and the
general public. The vulnerability to psychological distress across populations in
the COVID-19 pandemic could be attributed to a number of factors. In a study in
Myanmar, significant associations were found with place of residence, higher
educational level, and occupation like self-employment, healthcare professional
status, and student status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-jphr.2021.2279"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We found higher experiences of mild to moderate psychological distress, assuming that
the survey had done in the very early state of the pandemic. Grownups have more
stress that might relate to COVID-19 and its sequalae, provoking in psychological
distress. The researchers would like to highlight the high psychological distress
among self-employed groups who were in great disaster during lockdown and who have

betterment in planning the preventive and control measures together with
physical, social, and mental support to people who are directly and indirectly
affected by COVID-19. The highlight and priority should be given to develop
better strategies to self-employed groups and poor people for their support,
relief, and resettlement of their ruined status.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thanks Prof. Yifeng Xu, Jianyin Qiu, and their team from

Ferroptosis, triggered by iron overload and excessive lipid peroxides, is reportedly involved in I/R injury. However, its significance and mechanistic basis remain unclear. Here, we show that glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), a key endogenous suppressor of ferroptosis, determines the susceptibility to myocardial I/R injury. Importantly, ferroptosis is a major mode of cell death in I/R injury, distinct from mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)&#x02013;driven necrosis. This suggests that the use of therapeutics targeting both modes is an effective strategy to further reduce the infarct size and thereby ameliorate cardiac remodeling after I/R injury. Furthermore, we demonstrate that heme oxygenase 1 up-regulation in response to hypoxia and hypoxia/reoxygenation degrades heme and thereby induces iron overload and ferroptosis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of cardiomyocytes. Collectively, ferroptosis triggered by GPx4 reduction and iron overload in the ER is distinct from MPT-driven necrosis in both in&#x000a0;vivo phenotype and in&#x000a0;vitro mechanism for I/R injury. The use of therapeutics targeting ferroptosis in conjunction with cyclosporine A can be a promising strategy for I/R injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Key Words</title><kwd>ischemia-reperfusion injury</kwd><kwd>ferroptosis</kwd><kwd>glutathione peroxidase 4</kwd><kwd>MPT-driven necrosis</kwd><kwd>cyclosporine A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwrds0015"><title>Abbreviations and Acronyms</title><kwd>AMI, acute myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>CsA, cyclosporine A</kwd><kwd>CypD, cyclophilin D</kwd><kwd>DXZ, dexrazoxane</kwd><kwd>ER, endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>Fer-1, ferrostatin-1</kwd><kwd>GPx4, glutathione peroxidase 4</kwd><kwd>HF, heart failure</kwd><kwd>HO-1, heme oxygenase 1</kwd><kwd>H/R, hypoxia-reoxygenation</kwd><kwd>I/R, ischemia-reperfusion</kwd><kwd>LP, lipid peroxide</kwd><kwd>MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition</kwd><kwd>RCD, regulated cell death</kwd><kwd>STEMI, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0035">Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> It culminates in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a fatal disease accompanied by irreversible myocardial injury.

Subsequently, 10&#x000a0;mL of EDTA buffer was injected at the apex at the rate of 1&#x000a0;mL per 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min. The heart samples were then transferred to a Petri dish filled with perfusion buffer, and 3&#x000a0;mL of perfusion buffer was subsequently injected via the same needle hole at the apex. Thereafter, the heart was transferred to a Petri dish filled with collagenase buffer, and approximately 25&#x000a0;mL of collagenase buffer was injected until characteristics of degradation were observed. Subsequently, clamping was removed, and the left ventricle was isolated. The left ventricle was cut into 1-mm<sup>2</sup> pieces in 3&#x000a0;mL collagenase buffer, and the tissue was loosened by pipetting for 2&#x000a0;minutes. Stop buffer (5&#x000a0;mL) was added to the suspended solution in collagenase buffer, and the mixture was pipetted for 2&#x000a0;minutes. Undegraded tissues were removed by passing the suspension through a filter (pore size 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, 352360, Corning). Adult cardiomyocytes were allowed to settle by keeping the suspension still. To neutralize the adult cardiomyocytes to M199-based culture medium, the pellet was subsequently suspended in mixed buffers (calcium reintroduction buffers) of perfusion buffer and culture medium at, respectively, 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2. The pellet was finally suspended in plating medium, and adult cardiomyocytes were plated at 1,500 cells per well in a 96-well plate for a cell survival assay and the 1,000 cells per well in a 35-mm dish for iron measurement using FFR (the plates were coated with 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL laminin [23017015, Thermo Fisher Scientific] solution). The plating medium was changed to culture medium with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) 1 hour after incubation.

Analyzing genetically engineered mice and using adenoviruses harboring <italic>Gpx4</italic> and specific pharmacologic interventions, we obtained 3 major findings in this study: 1) GPx4 is a key regulator of ferroptosis in myocardial I/R injury; 2) ferroptosis operates independently from MPT-driven necrosis, and therapeutics targeting both ferroptosis and MPT-driven necrosis could achieve additional cardioprotection in I/R injury; and 3) iron overload in the ER through heme degradation by HO-1 causes H/R-induced ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. Our findings suggest that hypoxic response causes GPx4 reduction and HO-1 up-regulation, thereby triggering ferroptosis in I/R-injured myocardium through iron overload in the ER.</p><p id="p0225">Ferroptosis is defined as an RCD that is under constitutive control by GPx4.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> GPx4 determines the susceptibility to ferroptosis, with its reduction resulting in ferroptosis even if iron homeostasis is physiologically maintained.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> In the present study, we showed that GPx4 levels were reduced in both I/R-injured myocardium and cultured cardiomyocytes under H/R. We also demonstrated that the overexpression of GPx4 reduced the infarct size in myocardial I/R injury, whereas the hetero-deletion of GPx4 aggravated it. In addition, we showed that the overexpression of cytosolic GPx4 suppressed cell death induced by H/R. Taken together, these results suggest that ferroptosis is a major mode of RCD, and GPx4 is implicated as a critical regulator of ferroptosis in myocardial I/R injury.</p><p id="p0230">Ferroptosis is an RCD triggered by LPs, which are one of the final products initiated by oxidative stress. Given that MPT-driven necrosis is also triggered by oxidative stress, we initially hypothesized that ferroptosis and MPT-driven necrosis partially share a common signaling pathway in myocardial I/R injury. However, in the present study, GPx4 overexpression showed an additional benefit against myocardial I/R injury in conjunction with CsA treatment. Furthermore, cell death induced by H/R could not be prevented by CsA treatment in cultured cardiomyocytes, whereas this cell death was fully prevented by both cytosolic Gpx4 overexpression and Fer-1 treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), implicating ferroptosis as the major mode of cell death after H/R. To investigate the potentially overlapping mechanism of ferroptosis and MPT-driven necrosis, we examined the membrane potential in GPx4-deficient cardiomyocytes with the use of siRNA. We found that the membrane potential was also reduced in GPx4-deficient ferroptosis, as observed in cardiomyocytes treated with the protonophore m-chlorophenylhydrazone, an MPT-driven necrosis inducer (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figures&#x000a0;6A and 6B</xref>). However, CsA treatment did not prevent ferroptosis induced by silencing GPx4 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure&#x000a0;6C</xref>). Collectively, ferroptosis is distinct from MPT-driven necrosis, and the loss of membrane potential is not a cause of ferroptosis and is simply observed in ferroptosis as a common feature of cell death. This is consistent with the findings that Fer-1, but not CsA, prevents H/R-induced ferroptosis in neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;5E and 5F</xref>). Our findings suggest that ferroptosis is the predominant mode of cell death in myocardial I/R injury as well as MPT-driven necrosis, indicating that ferroptosis is a promising therapeutic target in conjunction with CsA treatment.</p><p id="p0235">The organelle responsible for ferroptosis initiation remains unclear. We first examined the role of the mitochondria with the use of Ad-mitoGPx4 because we initially hypothesized that ferroptosis uses the common machinery of MPT-driven necrosis. However, the present study demonstrated that H/R-induced ferroptosis was not inhibited by mitochondrial Gpx4 and mitochondria-targeting iron chelation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6E</xref>, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure&#x000a0;5B</xref>), whereas it could be fully prevented by cytosolic Gpx4 overexpression, suggesting that ferroptosis is triggered in organelles, excluding the mitochondria. To identify the pivotal organelle responsible for H/R-induced ferroptosis, we examined the iron levels in the ER, and found an increase in Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels in the ER with the use of FFR, which specifically targets the ER. Consistent with this finding, the iron overload in ER was also confirmed in I/R-injured myocardium and adult cardiomyocytes under Hx. Furthermore, FFR treatment for chelating Fe<sup>2+</sup> in the ER prevented H/R-induced ferroptosis. These results suggest that Hx and H/R increase iron levels in the ER and implicate the ER as a pivotal organelle in H/R-induced ferroptosis.</p><p id="p0240">HO-1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme to produce Fe<sup>2+</sup> as well as biliverdin and carbon monoxide. It is localized mainly at the ER and regulated by various stresses, including Hx. In the present study, we demonstrated that silencing HO-1 abolished both the iron overload and increase in LP levels, while preventing ferroptosis induced by H/R. This suggests that heme degradation through HO-1 up-regulation causes iron overload in the ER and induces ferroptosis. To identify the molecule responsible for iron overload in ER, we also investigated the other potential mechanism underlying iron overload in Hx. Indeed, the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (<italic>Tfrc</italic>), an importer of cellular iron, was upregulated in cultured cardiomyocytes after 4 hours of Hx (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure&#x000a0;7A</xref>). However, silencing <italic>Tfrc</italic> is not effective for abolishing iron overload in ER under Hx (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figures&#x000a0;7B and 7C</xref>). In addition, the expression of ferroportin (<italic>Slc40a1</italic>), an exporter of cellular iron, was downregulated in cultured cardiomyocytes after 4 hours of Hx (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure&#x000a0;8A</xref>). Moreover, silencing <italic>Slc40a1</italic> reduced its transcription 4 hours after siRNA transfection as well as after 4 hours of Hx, but did not reproduce the iron overload in ER (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figures&#x000a0;8B and 8C</xref>). Thus, we could not find evidence that transferrin and ferroportin are involved in iron overload in ER in our preparations. Nevertheless, they might be directly or indirectly responsible, in part, for iron overload under Hx in other preparations.</p><p id="p0245">HO-1 has an established role in cardioprotection during I/R injury.<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>41</sup></xref> Indeed, a detailed analysis of HO-1 in an I/R injury model by Yet et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> showed that cardiac-specific overexpression of HO-1 reduces infarct size, suggesting that the overall outcome of HO-1 is protective against I/R injury. In this context, the newly uncovered role of HO-1 in ferroptosis in I/R injury was intriguing for therapeutic strategy against I/R injury. Considering that several studies have confirmed the cardioprotective role of HO-1 against I/R injury by reducing oxidative stress through biliverdin and carbon monoxide,<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> our results do not overturn its cardioprotective role in I/R injury. However, the present findings do uncover the detrimental aspect of HO-1 in I/R injury, masked by favorable consequence through HO-1 up-regulation. Understanding the negative role of HO-1 in ferroptosis would be beneficial for the development of therapeutics by gain of function in HO-1 in I/R injury,<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> because HO-1 overexpression can potentially promote ferroptosis, thereby minimizing its cardioprotection in I/R injury. Therefore, concomitant therapy targeting ferroptosis can maximize the cardioprotection induced by gain of function in HO-1.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="p0250">We acknowledge 2 major limitations of this study. First, we used genetically engineered mice in which <italic>Gpx4</italic> was globally deleted or inserted in the mouse genome. Therefore, the ferroptosis in some cells, excluding cardiomyocytes, or tissues in the I/R model may be partly responsible for the cardiac phenotypes in these mice. Second, we did not find a significant cardioprotective effect against H/R-induced cell death by CsA in cardiomyocytes in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;5E and 5F</xref>), although ferroptosis and MPT-driven necrosis are equally responsible for myocardial I/R injury in mice in&#x000a0;vivo (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4D</xref>). To examine ferroptosis in comparison with MPT-driven necrosis in&#x000a0;vitro, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was&#x000a0;also&#x000a0;used to mimic the I/R injury in cultured cardiomyocytes, as previously described.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> However,&#x000a0;ferroptosis was the dominant form of cell&#x000a0;death on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, and the cardioprotective effect of CsA for cell survival was slight and nonsignificant against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure&#x000a0;9</xref>). Thus, we could not accurately reproduce MPT-driven necrosis in&#x000a0;vitro and evaluate ferroptosis compared with MPT-driven necrosis in cardiomyocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0255">Hx and H/R result in GPx4 down-regulation and HO-1 up-regulation, both of which work cooperatively to trigger ferroptosis in I/R injury through iron overload in the ER.

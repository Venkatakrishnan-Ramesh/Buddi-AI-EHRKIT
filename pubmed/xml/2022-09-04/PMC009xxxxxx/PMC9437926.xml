In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway targets incorrectly folded and unassembled proteins for turnover by the cytoplasmic proteasome. Previously, we showed that the rhomboid protease RHBDL4, together with p97, mediates membrane protein degradation. However, whether RHBDL4 acts in concert with additional ERAD components is unclear, and its full substrate spectrum remains to be defined. Here, we show that, in addition to membrane proteins, RHBDL4 cleaves aggregation-prone luminal ERAD substrates. Since mutations of the RHBDL4 rhomboid domain led to stabilization of substrates at the cytoplasmic side, we hypothesize that, analogous to the homolog ERAD factor derlin, RHBDL4 is directly involved in substrate retrotranslocation. RHBDL4&#x02019;s interaction with the erlin ERAD complex and reciprocal interaction of rhomboid substrates with erlins suggest that RHBDL4 and erlins form a complex that clips substrates and thereby rescues aggregation-prone peptides in the ER from aggregation.</p></abstract><abstract id="ABS2" abstract-type="summary"><title>In brief</title><p id="P4">Rhomboid family proteins, including derlins, play important roles in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.

Even though numerous factors assist folding, this is an error-prone process, and misfolded polypeptides are commonly removed by the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Christianson and Carvalho, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Strisovsky, 2021</xref>). If the burden of misfolded proteins exceeds the capacity of the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network, certain proteins aggregate, forming either unstructured, amorphous clusters or structured &#x003b2;-sheet amyloid fibers (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Balchin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Breydo and Uversky, 2015</xref>). This causes toxicity and is a hallmark of several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer&#x02019;s or Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Chiti and Dobson, 2017</xref>). Clearance of large misfolded proteins in the ER is accomplished by selective autophagy (ER-phagy) or a recently described vesicular ER-to-lysosome trafficking pathway (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Molinari, 2021</xref>). However, if not terminally aggregated, the best-characterized mechanism for the turnover of aberrant proteins is ERAD, which consists of several parallel pathways that allow removal of an exceptionally diverse set of aberrant proteins (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>). Best understood in yeast, three major degradation routes, ERAD-L, ERAD-M, and ERAD-C, are formed by distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that recognize proteins with lesions in the lumen, ER membrane, or cytoplasm, respectively (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>). Although this distinction may not be as strict in mammalian cells, defined sets of quality control factors still assist the turnover of different protein classes (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">McCaffrey and Braakman, 2016</xref>). Moreover, for turnover of soluble ERAD substrates, catalytically inactive rhomboid protease homologs, referred to as pseudoproteases (Der1 and Dfm1 in yeast; Derlin1, &#x02212;2, and &#x02212;3 in humans), are frequently required (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Strisovsky, 2021</xref>). After recruitment to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing a derlin protein, ERAD-L substrates are retrotranslocated across the ER membrane to reach the proteasome (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Strisovsky, 2021</xref>). To this end, ERAD substrates are extracted by the AAA+ ATPase p97, deglycosylated by an N-glycanase, and targeted to the proteasome (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2001</xref>). Work in yeast and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> suggests that, for ERAD-L substrates, Hrd1 forms the core of a retrotranslocation channel (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Baldridge and Rapoport, 2016</xref>). Consistent with this, the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the yeast Hrd1 complex revealed a sizable pore formed by two half-channels consisting of Hrd1 and Der1, which can accommodate a wide range of ERAD substrates, including bulky N-linked glycans (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). However, alternative ERAD pathways exist, for example, the degradation of activated inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)) receptors in mammals engages a megadalton (MDa) complex consisting of multiple copies of the type II membrane proteins Erlin1 and &#x02212;2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF170 (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>), but not Hrd1. As a variation on the theme, several ERAD substrates are processed by intramembrane proteases before extraction from the ER membrane (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Avci and Lemberg, 2015</xref>). Accordingly, the rhomboid intramembrane protease RHBDL4 has been linked to ERAD (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>), and it affects key aspects of the secretory pathway, such as tuning the N-linked glycosylation machinery and the rate of ER export (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Knopf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Wunderle et al., 2016</xref>). RHBDL4 uses a bipartite substrate recognition mechanism to select certain membrane proteins with unstable transmembrane (TM) domains. Primarily, RHBDL4 recognizes positively charged TM residues (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>), which destabilize the TM helix and act as a degradation signal (degron) of ERAD-M substrates. As a second layer of control, substrate recognition occurs through a conserved ubiquitin-interacting motif at the cytosolic C-terminal tail of RHBDL4 (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>). What features determine whether a protein enters a classical ERAD pathway or is first cleaved by RHBDL4 or another ER protease are unknown.</p><p id="P7">By asking what influence different proteostasis factors have on the turnover of ERAD-L substrates, we discovered that, in addition to its role in ERAD-M, RHBDL4 serves as a non-canonical factor in the clearance of misfolded ER luminal proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that, for clearance of luminal substrates, RHBDL4 cooperates with the erlin complex, a putative ERAD recruitment factor for aggregation-prone peptides. Since RHBDL4 ablation increases the load of insoluble versions of its substrates, we suggest that the RHBDL4-erlin complex plays an essential role in pre-aggregate clearance from the ER lumen via dislocation of substrates into the cytoplasm and proteasomal degradation.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Targeted siRNA screen identifies RHBDL4 as an ERAD-L component</title><p id="P8">To investigate pathway selection in ERAD, we transfected a soluble model substrate into Hek293T cells and analyzed its steady-state level in a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen. As model substrate, we generated a truncated version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy chain of 202 amino acids (MHC202), which comprises an antiparallel &#x003b2; sheet and two &#x003b1; helices formed by a tandem repeat of the so-called &#x003b1;1 and &#x003b1;2 domains (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Based on the primary sequence and the MHC crystal structure (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Bulek et al., 2012</xref>), we predicted that MHC202 is unstable, exposing an extensive hydrophobic surface (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). For cell-based screening, we tested p97, which is invariant for retrotranslocation, and 40 proteins that are in the ERAD protein interaction network (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>). While knockdown of p97 and the E3 ligase Hrd1 showed the strongest MHC202 steady-state increase, nine other candidates also showed a clear effect (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Among those were the Hrd1-associated ERAD factors Herp, Derlin2/3, and Sel1; the &#x003b1;1-mannosidases EDEM1/2; and the disulfide reductase Erdj5. While all these factors are known to be involved in the recognition and degradation of ERAD-L substrates (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>), we also observed that knockdown of the putative membrane-integral ER quality control factor Bap29 (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Abe et al., 2009</xref>) and the rhomboid protease RHBDL4 (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>) caused a modest increase in the MHC202 steady-state level. These factors had not been linked to Hrd1-mediated ERAD (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that non-canonical factors also contribute to MHC202-clearance.</p><p id="P9">Intramembrane proteases are commonly believed to cleave membrane-integral proteins, but exceptions are known (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;hnle et al., 2019</xref>). We, therefore, set out to characterize the unexpected role of RHBDL4 in MHC202 turnover. First, we confirmed that knockdown with two independent targeting sequences elevated MHC202 levels (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1B</xref>). The role of RHBDL4 in MHC202 turnover was further confirmed by cycloheximide chase in RHBDL4 knockout Hek293T cells, in which the half-life of MHC202 turnover increased from less than 1 h to approximately 2 h (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). However, inhibition was only partial, indicating that a redundant pathway targets MHC202 for degradation. Hence, we presume that induction of the ER unfolded protein response (UPR) observed upon RHBDL4 ablation (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>) masks the RHBDL4 knockout phenotype by upregulating alternative degradation routes. We generated Hrd1 knockout cells to investigate further whether RHBDL4 might act in parallel to Hrd1. The Hrd1 substrate null Hong Kong mutant of &#x003b1;1-antitrypsin (NHK) (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>) was fully stabilized in Hrd1 knockout cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1D</xref>). We then used metabolic pulse-label chase analysis to follow up on the MHC202 degradation kinetics in Hrd1 knockout cells. While for newly synthesized MHC202 in Hek293T wild-type (WT) cells an initial fast decay was observed, a fraction persisted for a longer time, different from the cycloheximide chase, increasing the apparent half-life to approximately 2 h (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1C</xref>). In contrast, in Hrd1 knockout cells, most MHC202 (~65%) was stable even up to 24 h (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that Hrd1 is the prime degradation route for MHC202. Despite that prominent stabilization of MHC202 in Hrd1 knockout cells, the 24-h chase revealed that approximately 35% of MHC202 was still degraded within 24 h (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). However, knockdown of RHBDL4 in this genetic background leads to further stabilization of MHC202 for up to 18 h (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that RHBDL4 acts as a second slower degradation route. Taken together, these additive effects show that two independent pathways can remove MHC202 with different kinetics, namely, canonical Hrd1-dependent retrotranslocation and a so-far unrecognized pathway that relies on RHBDL4. The mechanism that removes MHC202 when Hrd1 and RHBDL4 are both blocked and whether ER-phagy can compensate await further characterization.</p><p id="P10">To investigate whether RHBDL4 directly processes MHC202, we performed a cell-based cleavage assay (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with such a direct role of rhomboid-catalyzed cleavage in MHC202 clearance, overexpression of RHBDL4 WT, but not its catalytically inactive serine-144-alanine mutant (RHBDL4-SA), generated an N-terminal fragment with an apparent molecular weight of 18 kDa (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). While only traces of this cleavage product were observed in vehicle-treated cells, inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 increased its steady-state level. This result indicates that RHBDL4 generates an MHC202-cleavage fragment, which is dislocated into the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation in a manner analogous to that previously described for membrane-integral substrates (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, proteasome inhibition also stabilized deglycosylated full-length MHC202 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E</xref>). Again, this shows that MHC202 is degraded by the Hrd1 retrotranslocation route and an RHBDL4-dependent substrate clipping mechanism. Consequently, the full extent of RHBDL4 activity can be seen only when the downstream clearance pathway for fragments is blocked. Interestingly, overexpression of the catalytically inactive SA mutant stabilized deglycosylated MHC202 even in the absence of MG132. This observation suggests that, in a dominant-negative manner, the RHBDL4-SA mutant traps a partially retrotranslocated MHC202, exposing the glycosylation site to the cytoplasmic N-glycanase, while MHC202 is still bound to the rhomboid active site. A similar trapping effect was previously observed by overexpression of a mutant form of the rhomboid pseudoprotease Derlin1 (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Greenblatt et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this model, the RHBDL4-SA-induced deglycosylated MHC202 species is not observed upon siRNA knockdown of N-glycanase (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1F</xref>). Furthermore, in a co-immunoprecipitation assay from Triton X-100-solubilized cells, RHBDL4-SA co-purified the glycosylated as well as the deglycosylated MHC202, whereas ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged OS9 was not bound (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>RHBDL4-catalyzed cleavage of MHC202 and p97-mediated extraction are coupled</title><p id="P11">The observation that RHBDL4-SA functionally interacts with deglycosylated MHC202 indicates that rhomboid-catalyzed cleavage and protein dislocation into the cytoplasm are linked. As the ER-integral metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 has been shown to clear polypeptide chains that get stuck in the Sec61 translocon channel during post-translational translocation (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Ast et al., 2016</xref>), we decided to analyze the localization of MHC202 relative to the ER lumen before cleavage. As shown above, Endo H analysis revealed that the RHBDL4-generated N-terminal MHC202 fragment is glycosylated (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1E</xref>), indicating that it is formed in the ER lumen. To also discriminate between a putative translocation intermediate with the C terminus facing the cytoplasm and a fully translocated protein, we generated an MHC202 construct harboring an additional glycosylation site (K197N) in the C-terminal region (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>). We reasoned that only fully translocated MHC202 would be glycosylated at this site. Western blot analysis of MHC202-K197N co-expressed with RHBDL4 showed an Endo H-sensitive C-terminal fragment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>). Consistent results were obtained with an MHC202 mutant with only a single C-terminal glycosylation site (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2B</xref>), corroborating that RHBDL4 cleaves fully translocated MHC202. Consistent with this, RHBDL4 did not cleave an artificially designed ERdj3-GFP chimera that clogs the Sec61 translocon (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2C</xref>) and is cleaved by ZMPSTE24 (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Ast et al., 2016</xref>). To further prove that RHBDL4 deals with ERAD-L substrates, we performed a protease protection assay of isolated microsomes. While a certain fraction of glycosylated MHC202 was accessible to the protease, the RHBDL4-generated cleavage fragment was protected, confirming that it is generated in the ER lumen (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed ER localization of MHC202 under RHBDL4 knockdown conditions by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S2D</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2E</xref>). Interestingly, co-expression of the RHBDL4-SA trapping mutant significantly increased the pool of protease-accessible glycosylated MHC202 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), supporting our model of a stalled retrotranslocation intermediate.</p><p id="P12">To reach the proteasome, RHBDL4-generated cleavage fragments have to be dislocated into the cytoplasm. Consistent with this, the p97 inhibitor CB-5083 stabilized the 18-kDa N-terminal MHC202 fragment (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The addition of MG132 did not further increase recovery of the cleavage fragment, indicating that solely blocking p97 and consequent retention in the ER prevents RHBDL4-generated fragments from proteasomal clearance. In addition, we replaced a conserved arginine in RHBDL4&#x02019;s C-terminal tail with an alanine (R308A), which previously has been shown to be required for the interaction with p97 (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). As shown for the p97 inhibitor treatment, co-expression of the RHBDL4-R308A mutant or an RHBDL4 deletion mutant lacking the entire p97-binding motif (RHBDL4&#x00394;VBM) together with MHC202 results in the stabilization of the 18-kDa N-terminal MHC202 fragment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2F</xref>). Together with the trapping of deglycosylated MHC202 with the RHBDL4-SA mutant, these results indicate that RHBDL4 interacts with MHC202 during retrotranslocation, thereby generating cleavage fragments that are released into the cytoplasm, where they become degraded by the proteasome. Interestingly, we observed that deletion of the entire cytoplasmic domain of RHBDL4 does not prevent RHBDL4-mediated cleavage but also stabilizes deglycosylated MHC202 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2G</xref>). As combining this effect with the substrate-trapping SA mutant leads to an additive stabilization of deglycosylated MHC202, we speculate that RHBDL4 also interacts with a certain fraction of its substrates in a non-proteolytic manner.</p><p id="P13">Although the exact pseudoprotease mechanism in ERAD remains to be determined, previous work showed that mutation of a strictly conserved di-glycine motif (GxxxG) in TM helix 6 leads to a dominant-negative substrate-trapping mutant of Derlin1 (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Greenblatt et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, we asked whether RHBDL4 also directly contributes to the retrotranslocation of MHC202 and its cleavage fragments. Consistent with a mechanistic parallel to derlin-mediated retrotranslocation, co-expression of MHC202 with RHBDL4 mutants of the di-glycine motif, namely glycine-198-valine (G198V) or glycine-202-valine (G202V), stabilized deglycosylated MHC202 in the absence of MG132 (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In agreement with interaction, immunoprecipitation of RHBDL4-G202V co-purified a substantial amount of MHC202, in both its glycosylated and its deglycosylated form (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). For both mutants, no MHC202 cleavage fragments were observed under proteasome inhibition (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that also for RHBDL4, the GxxxG motif is critical for its activity. Consistent with what has been observed for the SA trapping mutant, co-expressing RHBDL4-G202V with MHC202 significantly increased its accessibility in a protease protection assay (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2H</xref>). Of note, mutating the GxxxG motif did not affect the interaction of RHBDL4 with p97 and its additional binding partners (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2I</xref> and see below), indicating that the protease forms its physiological complexes while in a dominant-negative manner stalling the retrotranslocation intermediates. Overall, these results reveal that RHBDL4 plays a previously unanticipated direct role in inducing retrotranslocation of the ERAD-L substrate MHC202 and its cleavage fragments. The exact molecular mechanism of how the rhomboid-fold of RHBDL4 contributes to retrotranslocation remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>RHBDL4 cleaves selected soluble ERAD-L substrates</title><p id="P14">Next, we asked whether other soluble ERAD-L substrates are also processed in the cell-based RHBDL4 cleavage assay. However, neither NHK (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hosokawa et al., 2003</xref>) nor an ER-retained mutant of prolactin (Prl-KDEL) (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>) were processed by ectopically expressed RHBDL4 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This suggests that RHBDL4 shows substrate specificity. As a follow-up, we tested two additional ERAD substrates resembling truncated type I membrane proteins, namely RI332, a deletion of ribophorin 1 (RPN1) (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Tsao et al., 1992</xref>), and a loss-of-function splice variant of the &#x003b2;-secretase (BACE476&#x00394;) (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Tanahashi and Tabira, 2007</xref>). BACE476&#x00394; was cleaved by ectopically expressed RHBDL4 leading to a 50-kDa fragment that appears between the glycosylated full-length 54-kDa form of BACE476&#x00394; and the MG132-stabilized 45-kDa deglycosylated species (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A</xref>). Interestingly, ectopic expression of RHBDL4 diminished the BACE476&#x00394; steady-state level and completely depleted the MG132-sensitive deglycosylated full-length 45-kDa species. This suggests that upon overexpression, RHBDL4 interacts with its substrates before they approach Hrd1 and thereby outcompetes the retrotranslocation of unprocessed BACE476&#x00394;. Consistent with a scenario of dislocating shorter, RHBDL4-generated BACE cleavage fragments into the cytoplasm, an overexposed western blot reveals a 40-kDa BACE peptide in response to MG132 treatment (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Although we previously observed that degradation kinetics in Hek293T cells were unaffected by RHBDL4 knockdown for RI332 (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>), processing of RI332 by an unknown ER protease had been observed before (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2006</xref>). Consistently, co-expression of RI332 with RHBDL4 generated several RI332 fragments in the range of 25&#x02013;35 kDa, whereas the SA mutant stabilized traces of deglycosylated unprocessed species, as previously observed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B</xref>). Remarkably, the type I membrane protein RPN1 is a native RHBDL4 substrate (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Knopf et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to canonical cleavage in the TM region, RPN1 is cleaved at the same position as the truncated RI332 ERAD substrate (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3B</xref>). This indicates that substrate selection of soluble substrates occurs in a manner related to the cleavage of membrane-anchored ectodomains.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Different determinants can trigger RHBDL4-catalyzed processing</title><p id="P15">Next, we asked whether triggering ubiquitination of full-length MHC class I heavy chain (MHC-FL; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), which is not cleaved by RHBDL4 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), would make it prone to cleavage. Therefore, we took advantage of the fact that as part of an immune evasion strategy, the human cytomegalovirus protein US11 targets MHC-FL toward ERAD E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Wiertz et al., 1996</xref>). However, even though US11 prompted a higher turnover of MHC-FL (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4</xref>A), co-expression of RHBDL4 did not lead to any proteolytic processing by RHBDL4 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). This shows that specific substrate features and not the general ubiquitination status and turnover rate determine recognition by RHBDL4. A TM degron is sufficient to induce RHBDL4-catalyzed cleavage, as previously demonstrated (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>). We fused the luminal part of MHC to the TM domain and cytosolic tail of a known RHBDL4 substrate, the &#x003b1; chain of the pre-T cell receptor (pT&#x003b1;). Consistently, the TM degron was sufficient for RHBDL4 recognition (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>), leading to efficient processing of the MHC-pT&#x003b1; fusion protein (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition to two major cleavage sites in the context of the TM region, we observed an 18-kDa fragment in the range of the MHC202 cleavage product. These results show that the C-terminal truncation of MHC202 is not strictly required for RHBDL4-catalyzed cleavage, and different determinants can lead to the same productive interaction with RHBDL4.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>RHBDL4 cleaves at a defined site, but additional features determine substrate selection</title><p id="P16">Processing of the membrane-anchored MHC-pT&#x003b1; in the same region as MHC202 supports the notion that RHBDL4 preferentially cleaves at specific amino acid residues. For bacterial rhomboid proteases, a loose consensus sequence with small side chains at the scissile peptide bond has been shown to determine cleavage specificity (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Strisovsky et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, we narrowed down the RHBDL4 cleavage site and then mutated small residues within this stretch to phenylalanines. For MHC202, cleavage by RHBDL4 was abolished in a mutant with a deletion between positions 121 and 128 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Within this stretch, four small residues are found in two pairs, namely glycine-121 (G121), cysteine-122 (C122), glycine-125 (G125), and serine-126 (S126). Only mutation of all four residues to phenylalanine (121FF,125FF) abolished cleavage completely, whereas mutating the second pair (125FF) partially reduced cleavage (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). This result indicates that the major processing occurs at G125, but G121 provides an alternative cleavage site. Interestingly, G125 is located at a surface-exposed loop between two antiparallel &#x003b2; sheets, forming the hydrophobic interface in MHC-FL (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Of note, mutation of small residues in the MHC202 cleavage site region to proline, which for bacterial rhomboids has been shown to prevent the processing of the nearby peptide bond (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Strisovsky et al., 2009</xref>), increased RHBDL4-catalyzed cleavage (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). This was particularly pronounced in the glycine-121-proline, serine-126-proline double mutant (PP). For this mutant, which, due to its unfolded state, shows an apparent higher molecular weight on SDS-PAGE, at least three additional RHBDL4-induced cleavage products are detectable (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Since proline is predicted to break secondary structure elements, these results indicate that the cleavage site accessibility has a major impact on MHC202 processing by RHBDL4. Overall, we provide evidence that RHBDL4 substrate selection is a multilayer process with sequence-specific recognition of the scissile peptide bond contributing to specificity, but with the secondary structure and the overall protein stability playing a dominating role.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>The erlin ERAD complex interacts with RHBDL4 and MHC202</title><p id="P17">As RHBDL4 did not primarily rely on the primary sequence for substrate selection, we wondered whether it assembles with other ERAD factors contributing to specificity. A critical step in analyzing membrane protein complexes is to combine efficient one-step affinity purification of proteins expressed at physiological levels. Therefore, we endogenously tagged RHBDL4 in Hek293T cells at its C terminus with a single FLAG tag using CRISPR-Cas12-mediated gene editing (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S5A</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B</xref>) (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Fueller et al., 2020</xref>). Hek293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged RHBDL4 were grown in medium supplemented with &#x0201c;heavy&#x0201d; labeled amino acids, whereas the parenteral Hek293T cells were cultured in normal medium. SILAC-coIP proteomics revealed 1.4-fold enrichment of the previously identified RHBDL4 cofactor p97 (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>), demonstrating the efficiency of this workflow. To identify core components of RHBDL4-dependent ERAD, we focused on proteins identified in all three replicates. Among the 20 proteins that showed enrichment in the RHBDL4-FLAG fraction greater than 1.4-fold were the chaperones BiP and calreticulin; two protein disulfide isomerases, namely PDI and Erp44; and both subunits of the regulatory glucosidase II (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Recently, it has also been shown that these soluble ER chaperones are cleaved by RHBDL4, promoting their secretion (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2022</xref>); however, the physiological relevance of this finding remains to be addressed. Furthermore, two homologous membrane-integral ERAD factors, namely Erlin1 and Erlin2, were enriched by 1.5-fold. We reasoned that the luminal quality control factors are probably co-purified with bound RHBDL4 substrates. Focusing on the erlins, we asked whether they are part of a functional membrane protein complex. Consistent with a stable assembly, co-immunoprecipitation confirmed co-purification of RHBDL4 with Erlin1 and Erlin2 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5E</xref>). Erlin1 and Erlin2 were previously demonstrated to form a MDa-ERAD complex that among other clients is involved in the degradation of the IP(3) receptor (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that RHBDL4 functionally interacts with this ERAD subbranch. The E3 ligase RNF170 previously shown to interact with the erlin complex was also co-purified with ectopically expressed RHBDL4 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5F</xref>). Interestingly, Erlin2 showed stronger interaction with RHBDL4-GFP WT than the catalytically inactive SA mutant (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5D</xref>), suggesting no trapping by the SA mutant, as would be the case for a RHBDL4 substrate. Hence, we may speculate that erlins play a role in substrate recruitment. As a putative substrate adaptor, they may bind to RHBDL4 also in the absence of a bound substrate, but potentially dissociate from a trapped, stalled rhomboid-substrate complex. In accordance with a functional interplay of RHBDL4 with the erlin complex, blue native polyacrylamide electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) of immunoisolated FLAG-tagged RHBDL4, both endogenously and ectopically expressed, showed distinct complexes in the range of 250 kDa to 1.2 MDa, with Erlin2 co-purifying and co-migrating with the largest assembly (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5G</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To test our hypothesis that erlins contribute to substrate recruitment for RHBDL4, we generated single and double Erlin1 and &#x02212;2 knockout cells and tested the stability of MHC202 by cycloheximide chase. To block compensation by lysosome-based pathways such as ER-phagy (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Molinari, 2021</xref>), we treated cells with the vacuolar ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S5J</xref>). Interestingly, knockout of Erlin1 leads to a reduced turnover of MHC202, whereas degradation of MHC202 was not significantly delayed upon Erlin2 knockout (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5H</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5I</xref>). Since erlins share high sequence similarity (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>), we hypothesized that a single knockout could be compensated for by the other homolog. Indeed, double knockout of Erlin1 and &#x02212;2 further slowed down the degradation of MHC202 (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistent with a direct role in recognizing RHBDL4 substrates, immunoprecipitation of Erlin1-HA or Erlin2-HA pulled down FLAG-tagged MHC202 but not the stable, secreted control protein Prl (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Altogether, these results show that RHBDL4 forms a MDa complex with both Erlin1 and &#x02212;2 and that both erlins engage with the RHBDL4 substrate MHC202.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>RHBDL4 facilitates the removal of aggregation-prone ERAD-L substrates</title><p id="P19">In addition to ERAD, Erlin2 was shown to act as a chaperone on the artificially designed, ER-targeted protein termed ER-beta (ER&#x003b2;) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6A</xref>), which, like MHC202, is aggregation prone (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Vincenz-Donnelly et al., 2018</xref>). As Erlin2 and RHBDL4 are part of one complex, we wondered whether RHBDL4 also interacts with and degrades ER&#x003b2;. Indeed, the catalytically inactive SA mutant of RHBDL4 traps ER&#x003b2;, resulting in co-immunoprecipitation of ER&#x003b2; with RHBDL4-SA but not WT (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). This mirrors the behavior of RHBDL4 substrates like MHC202 (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) or pT&#x003b1; (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, knockdown of RHBDL4 increased the ER&#x003b2; steady-state level (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6B</xref>). Furthermore, co-expression of RHBDL4 WT with ER&#x003b2; increased the generation of a C-terminal cleavage fragment (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). This raised the question of whether RHBDL4 might be of general importance for the turnover of aggregation-prone peptides. Interestingly, the disease-associated, aggregation-prone Aguadilla variant of the fibrinogen &#x003b3; chain harboring the arginine-375-tryptophan (R375W) substitution (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Brennan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Kruse et al., 2006</xref>) was cleaved four times more compared with the &#x003b3;-chain WT (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Consistent with a role of RHBDL4 in the clearance of aggregation-prone ERAD substrates, simultaneous knockdown of RHBDL4 and expression of the &#x003b3;-fibrinogen R375W mutant leads to increased UPR induction (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6F</xref>, <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6D</xref>). This indicates that the biophysical property of an aggregation-prone ERAD-L substrate likely targets the &#x003b3;-fibrinogen mutant into the RHBDL4-dependent ERAD clipping pathway. In agreement with a role of the RHBDL4 complex partners, Erlin1 and Erlin2 knockout leads to a significant increase in the &#x003b3;-fibrinogen-R375W steady-state level (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6B</xref>).</p><p id="P20">To determine the impact of RHBDL4 on the clearance of aggregation-prone ERAD-L substrates, we analyzed the Nonidet P-40 (NP-40)-insoluble fraction by western blotting. In addition to increasing the steady-state level of MHC202, knockdown of RHBDL4 also increases the MHC202 level recovered in the NP-40 insoluble fraction (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), but not for a truncated version of MHC202 (MHC121), corresponding to the RHBDL4-generated N-terminal cleavage fragment. MHC121 is not recovered in the NP-40 insoluble fraction, even upon RHBDL4 knockdown (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Of note, this further truncated version of MHC121 is rapidly degraded, so that we used Hrd1 knockout cells for this assay. Consistent increases in NP-40 insoluble protein aggregates upon knockdown of RHBDL4 were also observed for the aggregation-prone ERAD-L substrates ER&#x003b2;, &#x003b3;-fibrinogen WT, and the R375W mutant (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S6C</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6E</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6F</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that RHBDL4-catalyzed cleavage prevents aggregation of MHC202 and other ERAD-L substrates. The molecular mechanism of how the RHBDL4-erlin complex recognizes aggregation-prone protein conformations and how RHBDL4-catalyzed clipping facilitates dislocation into the cytoplasm are essential questions that remain to be solved in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P21">Protein aggregation is associated with aging and human disorders ranging from diabetes to neurodegeneration (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). While multiple safeguards are known to cope with cytoplasmic aggregates, little is known about pathways clearing aggregating proteins from the ER lumen. Our results show that the rhomboid protease RHBDL4 contributes to the turnover of aggregation-prone ERAD-L substrates. While luminal substrates commonly are degraded through a Sel1, Hrd1, and derlin-dependent retrotranslocation route (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Christianson and Carvalho, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Strisovsky, 2021</xref>), aggregation-prone conformations of the same substrates may be targeted by the erlin complex to RHBDL4 for cleavage (<xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). We suggest that this rhomboid-catalyzed clipping mechanism may facilitate protein turnover by generating shorter fragments that are more easily dislocated into the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation. Under conditions when RHBDL4-dependent ERAD is compromised or the substrate load exceeds its capacity, various ERAD-L substrates aggregate, highlighting the importance of this proteostasis mechanism.</p><sec id="S11"><title>RHBDL4 binds erlins to facilitate recognition of aggregation-prone ERAD-L substrates</title><p id="P22">Biochemical analysis suggests that rhomboid proteases act as single-chain proteases (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Urban and Wolfe, 2005</xref>). This is a striking difference from the aspartic intramembrane protease presenilin, which, in order to become active, has to assemble with three invariant subunits, Nicastrin, PEN2, and APH1, forming the &#x003b3;-secretase complex (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Takasugi et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we reveal that the two ERAD factors Erlin1 and &#x02212;2 (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>) are in a native complex with RHBDL4. This shows a striking parallel to PARL, which forms a complex with the <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>-AAA-protease YME1L and the erlin homolog SLP2 (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Wai et al., 2016</xref>).

Our BN-PAGE analysis revealed several RHBDL4 complexes, including an assembly &#x0003e;1 MDa containing endogenous Erlin2. Previous work has shown the interaction of erlins with ERAD substrates as diverse as the IP(3) receptor (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>) and the artificially designed aggregation-prone luminal peptide ER&#x003b2; (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Vincenz-Donnelly et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, the erlin complex is predicted to form an assembly similar to chaperonins, albeit without ATPase activity, and was hypothesized to bind hydrophobic stretches that are a hallmark for aggregating proteins (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>).

Hence, in addition to controlling the integrity of the membrane proteome (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>), RHBDL4 serves as an important fail-safe mechanism for ER luminal protein homeostasis by lowering the concentration of aggregation-prone ERAD-L substrates.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Recognition of ERAD-L substrates by the rhomboid active site</title><p id="P23">The crystal structures of the <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> rhomboid protease GlpG revealed the active site to be located several angstroms beneath the membrane surface, in the center of a six-TM-helix bundle (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).

While helical, lipid-embedded substrate TM segments are thought to unfold into the active site via the membrane-embedded lateral gate, it is conceivable that for RHBDL4, ERAD-L substrates lacking any TM anchor enter the active site from the ER lumen. We and others have observed rhomboid cleavage in a related manner within ectodomains and loops of membrane proteins (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Fleig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Maegawa et al., 2007</xref>), and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> detergent-solubilized rhomboids are known to cleave soluble model substrates (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).

While Der1 in yeast is specific for soluble substrates (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Carvalho et al., 2006</xref>) and a second derlin Dfm1 deals only with membrane proteins (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Neal et al., 2018</xref>), RHBDL4 and mammalian derlins may act on both membrane-integral and soluble substrates. Although the exact mechanism of retrotranslocation remains to be determined, the cryo-EM structures of ERAD complexes have revealed first insights (for review, see <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Strisovsky, 2021</xref>). Most prominently, a structural model of the yeast Hrd1 complex indicates that the ERAD-L substrates are inserted into the plane of the membrane via the rhomboid fold of Der1 and pass the lipid bilayer in between two half-channels formed by Hrd1 and Der1, respectively (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Our observation that several RHBDL4 mutants stabilize uncleaved substrates while they are looped into the cytoplasm indicates that RHBDL4 also contributes to retrotranslocation. Strikingly, mutations of the conserved GxxxG motif in human Derlin1 revealed a very similar dislocation intermediate (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Greenblatt et al., 2011</xref>). For RHBDL4, the default pathway appears to be substrate clipping and retrotranslocation of cleavage fragments. However, we hypothesize that, based on its homology to derlins, in concert with other ERAD factors, RHBDL4 may also contribute in a non-proteolytic manner to protein dislocation into the cytoplasm. Similarly, the bacterial rhomboid protease YqgP both has a proteolytic function and acts as a pseudoprotease when it recruits conformational variants of a membrane transporter to the AAA protease FtsH for degradation (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Began et al., 2020</xref>). The parallel of bacterial rhomboid proteases in membrane protein quality control (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Began et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) to derlins and RHBDL4 in ERAD suggests that rhomboid family proteins represent an ancient proteostasis factor (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Lemberg and Strisovsky, 2021</xref>). While initially evolved as proteases, certain rhomboids like the derlins may have lost their catalytic activity during eukaryotic evolution.

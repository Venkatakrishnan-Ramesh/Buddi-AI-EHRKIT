However, being an off-label drug, its efficacy remains under question. The advent of ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genetech) as a recombinant humanized antibody antigen-binding fragment molecule, has given new and proven dimension to anti-VEGF actions for various indications in retinal pathologies as well as in cases of NVG requiring surgical management including glaucoma drainage device surgeries like Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) implantation.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>However, presently there is scarce data on the definite timing on use of intravitreal as an adjunctive therapy during AGV implantation so as to enable the best possible outcome for the patient while reducing the incidence of intra operative and postoperative complications and iatrogenic morbidity.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study, wherein the effects of concurrent administration of intravitreal ranibizumab with primary AGV implantation in NVG patients were compared with those who underwent primary AGV implantation alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>M<sc>aterials and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><p>This retrospective comparative study was carried out based on the data collected in patients of neovascular glaucoma who underwent Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) implantation with or without concurrent intravitreal ranibizumab between the period from Feb 2009 to Feb 2015 at a tertiary level research institute. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Committee, Army Hospital (R &#x00026; R), Delhi Cantt, and ethical clearance were obtained. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients to use the data omit obtained from the surgical outcome for research purpose. The data of 87 patients between age group from 40&#x02013;70 years diagnosed with neovascular glaucoma with a history of prior pan-retinal photocoagulation and 03 dosages of anti-VEGF for the preexisting retinal disease were included to participate in the study. The patients were diagnosed as NVG on the basis of gonioscopic findings of neovascularization of iris and/or anterior chamber of the eye and/or iridocorneal angle, with elevated IOP (&#x0003e;21 mm Hg) refractory to maximum antiglaucoma drugs. Patients having a vision of no light perception, NVG due to causes like uveitis and intraocular tumor, ocular trauma, previous filtration surgery, or cyclodestructive procedures, scleral buckling were excluded.</p><p>The data obtained from the patients were divided into two groups: out of 87 patients, 45 patients were assigned to the study group and 42 patients were allotted to the control group. Out of these, seven patients were excluded from the study as five patients from the study group and two patients from the control group had a follow-up of less than 2-years. Hence, the study design was confined to a total of 80 eyes comprising of 40 eyes in each group. Patients from the study group (group A) received intraoperative Intravitreal ranibizumab injection with Primary AGV Implantation as a concurrent procedure. The remaining 40 patients who underwent Primary AGV Implantation only were marked as control (group B). A detailed history was taken from all the patients regarding the duration of glaucoma, associated systemic diseases like diabetes or hypertension, history of previous retinal disease, and treatment received such as panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) or intravitreal anti-VEGF along with etiology of NVG. Visual acuity was assessed using Snellen's visual acuity chart and a detailed slit lamp examination was carried out to evaluate the cornea, lens status, neovascularization at iris, or angle by gonioscopy. Intraocular pressure was measured by Goldman applanation tonometry. Record of preoperative and postoperative antiglaucoma medications and associated intra- and postoperative complications were also analyzed.</p><p>The management protocol comprised of PRP as well as pars plana administration of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.05 mL at least for three occasions prior to glaucoma surgery while ensuring a minimum time interval of 4 weeks between last injection and Primary AGV surgery. Measurements of IOP and BCVA, fundus evaluation was done preoperatively and post post AGV implantation at 1st day, 1st, 4th, 12th week and thereafter 6 monthly up to 3-year.</p><sec><title>Surgical Procedure</title><p>All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon (J.K.S.P.) under peribulbar anesthesia. After peritomy, fornicial based conjunctival flap was raised supero-temporally. A sub-Tenon's pocket was created extending up to the equator and a 4 &#x000d7; 4 mm scleral tunnel was prepared by a 2.5 mm tunnel blade (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). After priming of valve with a balanced salt solution by 30 gauze cannula (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), the valve plate was anchored to sclera by 7&#x02013;0 nylon sutures 7&#x02013;8 mm from the limbus (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The edge of the tube was trimmed obliquely with the bevel facing upwards to ensure intraocular intrusion of about 2 mm (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The entry into the anterior chamber was made with a 23&#x02013;G needle and the tunnel was secured by 8&#x02013;0 vicryl sutures. The author has applied a further modification to the surgical technique by applying three compression sutures over the silicon tube at three different places with 8&#x02013;0 vicryl sutures to minimize the possibility of extensive hypotony and choroidal effusion in the early postoperative period. To manage postoperative hypotony, the anterior chamber was reformed with the help of intracameral injection of sodium hyaluronate. After conjunctival repositioning, subconjunctival antibiotics and corticosteroids were injected well away from the surgical site. In group A patients, intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg in 0.05 mL) was concurrently administered intraoperatively through pars plana (3.5 mm away from the limbus) with a 1 mL tuberculin syringe attached to a 30&#x02013;gauge needle at the end of AGV implantation whereas in group B only AGV implantation was done. As per postoperative protocol all patients were given topical antibiotics and steroids (0.1% Dexamethasone) for 6 weeks in tapering dosages. Eye drop Atropine Sulphate 1% was prescribed in all cases for the period of 1 week. Antiglaucoma drugs were given, if required, during the phase of hypertony or during subsequent follow-up.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figs 1A to D</label><caption><p>Surgical technique</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jocgp-16-41-g001" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>Surgical success was defined as IOP &#x0003c;21 and &#x0003e;8 mm Hg without additional surgical maneuver with or without antiglaucoma medication at 3-years follow-up.

Four eyes (10%) in group A and seven eyes (17.5%) in group B experienced hypotony (IOP &#x0003c; 5 mm Hg). A shallow anterior chamber was seen in four eyes (10%) and eight eyes (20%) respectively groups A and B, in initial postoperative periods, for which AC reformation was performed by injecting sodium hyaluronate into the anterior chamber. Hyphema resolved spontaneously, lasting 3 days up to 2 weeks depending upon the amount of hyphema. Three eyes (7.5%) in group A and six eyes (15%) in group B had choroidal effusion with shallow AC, which was treated conservatively with systemic steroids and eye drop Atropine 1%. Corneal decompensation was seen in one patient (2.5%) in group A and three patients (7.5%) in group B. Five eyes in group A and six eyes in group B, who had lenticular opacities before the surgery, developed visually significant cataracts during follow-up. In group A, six eyes (15.5%) were labeled as failed, reasons being corneal decompensation with high IOP uncontrolled on maximal medications and loss of light perception (one eye) and uncontrolled IOP (&#x0003e; 21 mm Hg) on maximal antiglaucoma therapy needing another glaucoma intervention (five eyes). Eight eyes (20%) were designated as failed due to corneal decompensation with uncontrolled high IOP (three eyes), high IOP needing another glaucoma intervention (five eyes) out of which two eyes lost perception of light in group B.

This abnormal fibrovascular tissue initially impairs aqueous outflow in the presence of an open angle with subsequent progression to typically severe and unrelenting secondary synechial angle closure glaucoma which is refractory to treatment. Raised VEGF levels in aqueous humor can trigger fibrosis in tissues around the plate, the most important factor in surgical failure.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The fragile new vessels in the iris and anterior chamber angle tend to bleed leading to inflammation, hyphema, and fibrinous reaction in the postoperative period and adversely affecting the success rate.</p><p>Panretinal photocoagulation, though an important tool, cannot prevent the re-emergence of neovascularization, until the etiological factor responsible for retinal ischemia is remedied.

Our study too demonstrates that there was no significant difference in surgical success rates, IOP control levels, reduction in requirement of antiglaucoma medications or gain of vision between the two groups, with concurrent administration of ranibizumab along with AGV implantation for NVG although there was significantly lesser postoperative complications, faster NVI regression and delayed NVI re-emergence in the study group as compared to the control group. Thus, when compared to the available literature, the results of our study suggest that the efficacy of ranibizumab, as an adjuvant administered concurrently in treatment of NVG with AGV implantation, may be similar to Bevacizumab although there is a need for more research to be done with concurrent administration of ranibizumab with AGV implantation for NVG patients, to confirm this and also to determine clinical indicators and timing of anti-VEGF injection for delivering best outcomes for the patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>C<sc>onclusion</sc></title><p>Concurrent intravitreal ranibizumab along with primary AGV implantation in patients of refractory NVG reduced operative and postoperative as well as restricted NVI, progression of retinal changes by delayed re-emergence of neovascularization.

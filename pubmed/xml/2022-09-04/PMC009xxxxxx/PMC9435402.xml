Most studies have been done with tobacco cigarettes, while few have examined the effect of electronic cigarettes (ECs) on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested the hypothesis that EC fluids and aerosols with high concentrations of nicotine promote SARS-COV-2 infection by increasing viral entry into human respiratory epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods:</title><p id="P4">Responses of BEAS-2B cells to authentic JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosols or their individual constituents (propylene glycol (PG)/vegetable glycerin (VG) and nicotine) were compared using three exposure platforms: submerged culture, air-liquid-interface (ALI) exposure in a cloud chamber, and ALI exposure in a Cultex&#x000ae; system, which produces authentic heated EC aerosols. SARS-CoV-2 infection machinery was assessed using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Specifically, the levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) and a spike modifying enzyme, TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2), were evaluated. Following each exposure, lentivirus pseudoparticles with spike protein and a green-fluorescent reporter were used to test viral penetration and the susceptibility of BEAS-2B cells to infection.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results:</title><p id="P5">Nicotine, EC fluids, and authentic JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosols increased both ACE2 levels and TMPRSS2 activity, which in turn increased viral particle entry into cells. While most data were in good agreement across the three exposure platforms, cells were more responsive to treatments when exposed at the ALI in the Cultex system, even though the exposures were brief and intermittent. In the Cultex system, PG/VG, PG/VG/nicotine, and JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosols significantly increased infection above clean air controls. However, both the PG/VG and JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> treatments were significantly lower than nicotine/PG/VG. PG/VG increased infection only in the Cultex&#x000ae; system, which produces heated aerosol.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p id="P6">Our data are consistent with the conclusion that authentic JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosols or their individual constituents (nicotine or PG/VG) increase SARS-CoV-2 infection. The strong effect produced by nicotine was modulated in authentic JUUL aerosols, demonstrating the importance of studying mixtures and aerosols from actual EC products. These data support the idea that vaping increases the likelihood of contracting COVID-19.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>E-cigarette</kwd><kwd>JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup></kwd><kwd>Nicotine</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Air-liquid Interface</kwd><kwd>ACE2</kwd><kwd>TMPRSS2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S5"><title>Introduction:</title><p id="P7">COVID-19 (corona virus disease-2019), a serious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), has resulted in the death of over 1,000,000 people in the United States and an estimated 15,000,000 people worldwide [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Smoking can lead to lung diseases, including cancer and increases in viral infection [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and while there has been intense interest in the relationship between tobacco product/nicotine use and COVID-19 infection, progression, and severity, this relationship is currently poorly understood and sometimes contradictory.

SARS-CoV-2 viral fusion with the host cell is aided by TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2), an enzyme that modifies the viral spike protein, enabling it to fuse with the host cell [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The ACE2 receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is elevated in biopsies from the respiratory tract of human smokers compared to non-smokers, supporting the idea that smokers are more susceptible to COVID-19 [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Smith et al [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also found that smokers had elevated cathepsin B, an enzyme involved in spike processing following infection. In a single cell meta-analysis across various tissues, smoking was correlated with increased levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which may contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. TMPRRS2 expression was differentially regulated in different respiratory cell types of smokers [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Studies that directly examined viral entry into human cells concluded that cigarette smoking increases SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. One group further showed that cigarette smoking inhibited the airway basal cell repair processes and reduced the response of the innate immune system by suppressing interferon &#x003b2;&#x02212;1 [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], both factors that may contribute to the severity of the disease.</p><p id="P9">Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are nicotine delivery devices that have gained popularity in the last decade [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. ECs heat e-liquids to produce aerosols that contain numerous chemicals, some of which are distinct from those in tobacco smoke [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

These include negative effects on lung physiology and the immune response, which may make fighting and recovery from a COVID-19 infection more difficult.</p><p id="P10">Several in vivo studies with mice and in vitro studies with human cells have investigated the effects of vaping and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elevated ACE2 activities were found in the bronchial-lavage fluid from EC users and smokers [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Full body exposures to &#x0201c;Mint&#x0201d; but not &#x0201c;Mango&#x0201d; aerosols generated from JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> pods increased ACE2 levels in mouse lung [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

While these studies reported gender differences, they were not in agreement with respect to the gender affected.</p><p id="P11">The effects of EC use and ACE2 levels has been studied in vitro with cultured human cells from the respiratory system. BEAS-2B cells treated with e-liquids in submerged culture showed that PG/VG elevated ACE2 mRNA expression, and the effect was dependent on other chemicals in the e-liquid mixture [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; e-liquid increased infection in primary tracheobronchial and small airway epithelium in submerged culture [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; however, e-liquid rather than authentic aerosol was tested.</p><p id="P12">The relationship between vaping authentic EC aerosols and acquisition of COVID-19 is poorly understood. To add clarity to this topic, we tested the hypothesis that EC aerosols increase SARS-CoV-2 infection by increasing levels of ACE2 in human bronchial epithelium, increasing levels and activities of TMPRRS2, and increasing viral infection. We performed controlled laboratory experiments with human cells that were exposed to known concentrations of both JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; EC fluids and aerosols, nicotine, PG and VG, and then examined discrete endpoints relevant to infection. We chose JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; because this product is currently marketed, popular, and has few flavor chemicals [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], making its fluid and aerosol a relatively simple mixture for testing. Moreover, tobacco flavored products are likely to remain marketable in the future as they are not subject to the FDA&#x02019;s enforcement policy that proposes to remove flavored EC products from the market [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We tested both JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; fluid and aerosols equivalent to those inhaled during vaping. Testing was done across three <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> exposure platforms: submerged cultures, cloud chamber ALI exposure, and Cultex&#x000ae; ALI exposure. Submerged culture has historical importance and is still frequently used [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The cloud chamber enables individual chemicals to be studied without using heat to create the aerosol, so that endpoint effects can be attributed to a particular chemical(s) without interference from other chemicals, solvents, or reaction products [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The Cultex&#x000ae; system was used to vape JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> ECs by heating their fluid to create authentic JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosols, which are equivalent to those an EC user inhales. Cultex&#x000ae;-generated aerosols contain the chemicals normally present in the fluid [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] plus any reaction products or metals added when fluid is heated in an EC atomizer [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] Infection of cells was evaluated using SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles with a green-fluorescent reporter protein.

These results support the conclusion that JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; e-liquids and aerosols can increase ACE2 levels, TMPRSS2 activity, and infection of BEAS-2B bronchial epithelial cells by SARS-COV-2 pseudoparticles. By examining different exposure protocols (submerged vs ALI) and chemical variables (fluids, aerosols, PG/VG, and nicotine), we show that the effects of ECs on viral infection depend on both the context in which exposures occur (submerged vs ALI) and the chemical formulations of the aerosols <italic toggle="yes">per se</italic>. In submerged cultures and cloud chamber exposures, increases in ACE2 levels and infection can be attributed mainly to nicotine. In the Cultex&#x000ae; system, these increases were associated with both nicotine and PG/VG, perhaps due to formation of reaction products (e.g., aldehydes, ketones and alcohols) from the solvents during heating [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

While both the levels and activity of TMPRSS2 increased in submerged cultures, only activity increased in ALI exposures. Increases in TMPRSS2 activity were associated mainly with nicotine, while PG/VG produced a small but significant decrease in the Cultex&#x000ae; system. While JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosols increased infection significantly, this increase was not as great as in the group containing only PG/VG/nicotine in concentrations equivalent to those in JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, showing both that JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> e-liquid decreased the effects of nicotine and the importance of testing authentic EC aerosols, such as JUUL, which modulated the effectiveness of nicotine. For most endpoints, both submerged and ALI exposures led to similar conclusions, but the ALI provides data on an exposure similar to that an EC user receives. Moreover, the Cultex&#x000ae; exposure enables testing of authentic EC aerosols and is the best protocol for evaluating the human response.</p><p id="P49"><xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the nicotine concentrations in our three exposure platforms (fluid concentrations in submerged exposures and concentrations measured in insert culture media after ALI exposures) and compares them to estimated nicotine concentrations in human alveolar lining fluid after smoking a cigarette [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We adjusted exposures in the two ALI platforms to produce similar final concentrations of nicotine in the insert fluids after exposure. As seen in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the nicotine concentrations in both the Cultex&#x000ae; and cloud chamber inserts were similar and were within the range reported in the alveolar lining fluid of smokers after smoking one cigarette [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], supporting the conclusion that our ALI exposures were reasonable and representative of those received in vivo by humans during vaping. A much higher starting concentration, which is similar to concentrations found in actual EC products, was used in the Cultex&#x000ae; system as the aerosol is diluted before entering the exposure chamber to ensure uniform distribution. In contrast, undiluted aerosol can be used in the cloud chamber, where it disperses uniformly and hence a lower starting concentration and puff number was used. These data demonstrate that chemical exposures were similar between the cloud chamber and Cultex&#x000ae; system and that exposures in the ALI systems, based on nicotine concentration, were within the range a tobacco product user would have in their alveolar lining fluid.</p><p id="P50">The effective concentrations and length of exposure to nicotine differed across exposure platforms. Nicotine increased SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle infection of BEAS-2B cells in all exposure systems; however, in submerged culture, exposures were continuous over 24 hours, while in the ALI systems, exposures were intermittent and short in duration, suggesting cells are more sensitive when exposed at the ALI. Our data are in agreement with other studies showing that zinc nanoparticle exposure of A549 cells was more likely to produce an effect in ALI exposures than in submerged cultures [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and that gaseous exposure to aldehydes at the ALI caused significantly higher levels of IL-8 secretion than submerged culture exposures [<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The apparent increase in cell sensitivity at the ALI may come about because nicotine or other chemicals in the EC aerosols were not diluted by the medium and interact directly with the surface of cells in the absence of culture medium. Because the effects of nicotine on infection are concentration dependent, results of both the ALI and submerged exposures are likely to vary with EC products, which are available in a broad range of nicotine concentrations [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Our in vitro models support the conclusion that cells are more responsive to nicotine at the ALI than when submerged and that nicotine dose dependently increases ACE2 levels, TMPRSS2 activity, and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle infection.</p><p id="P51">One of our goals was to examine the effects of individual chemicals in JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosols on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and infection. JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; was chosen because its concentrations of nicotine and PG/VG are known, and it has relatively few flavor chemicals, which are used at low concentrations [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our experiments compared authentic JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; aerosols to aerosols made with fluids containing PG/VG, nicotine, and/or PG/VG/nicotine mixtures using chemical concentrations that replicated those in JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; fluid. JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; aerosol increased the levels of ACE2 in BEAS-2B cells across all platforms, in agreement with and extending prior work showing that submerged treatment of BEAS-2B cells with Watermelon-flavored refill fluid increased ACE2 transcripts in BEAS-2B cells [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> fluids also increased ACE2 enzymatic activity in vitro [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] although ACE2 serves as a spike protein receptor and its activity is not required for infection [<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Our data isolated these increases to nicotine and PG/VG in the Cultex&#x000ae; system. Our data further showed that: (1) nicotine increased ACE2 levels dose dependently, (2) the nicotine concentration in JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; was sufficient to significantly elevate ACE2, and (3) the concentrations of nicotine reaching insert media in both the cloud chamber and Cultex&#x000ae; system were within the range reported in smokers alveolar lining fluid [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].

Our data show that PG/VG, nicotine, and JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosols had different effects on TMPRSS2 activity. In most cases, TMPRSS2 activities were significantly increased by nicotine. An interesting exception was the lack of effect of JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; aerosols on TMPRSS2 activity, even though JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosol had a nicotine concentration similar to that in the group with 60 mg/mL of pure nicotine in PG/VG. This again shows the importance of examining authentic EC aerosols as the effects of nicotine may be modulated in complex aerosols containing mixtures of chemicals.</p><p id="P53">In summary, our data show that JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d; aerosols modulated the infection machinery in BEAS-2B cells in a manner that increased infection by SARS-CoV-2 viral pseudoparticles. However, nicotine in PG/VG was more effective than nicotine in JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosol, showing that chemicals in authentic JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> aerosols can reduce nicotine&#x02019;s effect. In ALI exposures, increases in infectivity were generally correlated with nicotine and/or PG/VG induced increases in ACE2 concentrations and increases in TMPRRS2 activity. Results were generally similar across the three exposure platforms, but exposures in the ALI systems were brief and intermittent and involved lower concentrations of nicotine than in submerged cultures, which received 24 hours of continuous exposure. Given the highly variable nature of EC devices and their fluids [<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], it is probable that infection by SARS-CoV-2 is influenced by the product, user topography, and the e-liquid used for aerosol generation. Our data identify chemicals in EC liquids and aerosols that affect SARS-CoV-2 infection, show that JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> EC aerosols can modulate infection, and identify nicotine and PG/VG as chemicals that can increase SARS-CoV-2 infection of human bronchial epithelium. Given the number of factors that can influence infection, it is not surprising that prior studies on tobacco products, mainly conventional cigarettes, have sometimes differed in their conclusions regarding the relationship between smoking/vaping and COVID-19 [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. EC products are highly variable and have nicotine concentrations ranging from 0 to 60 mg/mL [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]; operate at different powers, have different atomizer designs [<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], and have varying chemical mixtures in their fluids, all of which can affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity differently. Based on our BEAS-2B data, it is probable that some EC products deliver sufficient nicotine to increase infection, while those that are nicotine-free or have low concentrations of nicotine may not influence SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p id="P54">Our data support the conclusion that understanding the relationship between EC use and COVID-19 will be challenging due to the many variables related to vaping. Variations in EC design, power, user topography, and e-liquid ingredients are some of the factors that can influence SAR-CoV-2 infection. These variables notwithstanding, our data can be valuable in improving the safety of EC. For example, since nicotine increased infection dose dependently, capping the allowable concentration of nicotine in e-liquids could reduce the likelihood of SARSCoV-2 infection in EC users.</p><sec id="S25"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p id="P55">We examined the effect of EC aerosols on BEAS- 2B cells. In the future, it will be important to extend these studies to a 3D organotypic model of the respiratory epithelium that closely resembles <italic toggle="yes">in-vivo</italic> exposure in humans. Our study is limited to one SARS-CoV-2 variant and could in the future be extended to new variants as they arise. Our work included JUUL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> &#x0201c;Virginia Tobacco&#x0201d;, which operates with a relatively low voltage and power. Variations in power can affect formation of reaction products, which may in turn alter infectability of cells. Finally, our exposures were acute and could be extended to chronic exposure in the future.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S27"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p id="P57">We thank Dr. James Pankow, Dr. Wentai Lou, and Kevin McWhirter from Portland State University for quantifying the deposition of nicotine in the ALI exposure systems.

ACE2 levels increased with all treatments in each exposure platform. TMPRSS2 activity varied with the platform and treatment. Most treatments increased TMPRSS2 activity, three treatments had no effect (PG/VG in submerged and PG/VG and JUUL in the Cultex exposures), and one treatment decreased activity (PG/VG in the Cultex). Infection was increased in all treatments/exposures.

Some patients complain of difficulty eating without hand support because of cervical instability. A typical characteristic of patients with DHS is that the cervical kyphosis can be correctable by passive extension;<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> these patients do not show a dropped head condition in the temporary neutral position. In contrast, cervical spondylotic kyphosis usually presents cervical rigidity,<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and this condition cannot be corrected by passive cervical extension with decreased cervical range of motion. This is because cervical instability in DHS is mostly not associated with cervical bone or joint deformity, but with weakness of cervical extensor muscles and ligaments. Therefore, the onset and course of DHS is different from cervical spondylotic kyphosis.</p><p>DHS was defined as follows: 1) the patient showed chin-on-chest deformity clinically after a few minutes in natural position, and 2) the deformity was correctable in the supine position. Correction of the cervical spine was confirmed by cervical MRI in the supine position.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Sudden-onset DHS was defined as presenting with chin on chest deformity within 3 days from the time of being aware of cervical weakness. All subjects were examined by neurologists concerning possible Parkinson&#x02019;s or neuromuscular disease, and then diagnosed as INEM. Patients with neuromuscular disease and a history of previous spinal operation were excluded from this study. The onset of DHS could be classified into 2 types:<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> 1 acute within a few months and the other gradual over a few years. However, there is little evidence to date regarding the clinical course of DHS, and sudden-onset DHS has never been reported. We experienced 8 cases of sudden-onset DHS due to INEM (6 females and 2 males; age: 71.9 &#x000b1; 10.9 years), and we herein present their backgrounds and outcomes.</p><p>Clinical details in cases are shown in <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, which presents clinical course, global alignment, associated pain, and outcome. The features of chin-on-chest deformity were examined by photographs or lateral cervical radiographs in an outpatient clinic. The primary treatment was conservative, consisting of cervical orthosis and physical therapy for at least 3 months for all cases. Cervical orthosis was recommended in order to maintain an upright position. Physical therapy was performed once a month at the outpatient clinic, and the patients practiced physical training daily at home. This physical training consisted of 2 types: 1 was global balance training, including the lumbopelvic region, and the other was isometric exercise to maintain an upright position. The mean follow-up period was 18.8 months (6 to 72 months). At the first visit to our facility, cervical and global radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were conducted. During the conservative treatment, some patients underwent pathological examinations by muscle biopsy or echography to analyze the muscle condition. Even after conservative treatment, surgical intervention was chosen for patients with continued severe quality-of-life disturbances. Regarding outcome, the improvement was defined by clinical evaluation (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="t1"><label>TABLE 1.</label><caption><p>Case series</p></caption><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Case No.</th><th align="center">Age (yrs)</th><th align="center">Sex</th><th align="center">Features</th><th align="center">Type</th><th align="center">Comorbidity</th><th align="center">Onset</th><th align="center">Clin Grad 1st Interv (mos)</th><th align="center">Clin Grad<break/>Improved<break/>(mos)</th><th align="center">Clin Grad Recur<break/>(mos)</th><th align="center">Pain<break/>Onset</th><th align="center">Pain Follow</th><th align="center">Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">1<hr/></td><td align="center">81<hr/></td><td align="center">F<hr/></td><td align="center">Chin on chest<hr/></td><td align="center">C<hr/></td><td align="center">Bladder cancer<hr/></td><td align="center">1 day<hr/></td><td align="center">2 (0.1)<hr/></td><td align="center">1 (4)<hr/></td><td align="center">None<hr/></td><td align="center">(++)<hr/></td><td align="center">(&#x02212;)<hr/></td><td align="center">Improved<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">2<hr/></td><td align="center">87<hr/></td><td align="center">M<hr/></td><td align="center">Chin on chest supported by hand<hr/></td><td align="center">D<hr/></td><td align="center">Atelectasis<hr/></td><td align="center">3 days<hr/></td><td align="center">3 (5)<hr/></td><td align="center">1 (7)<hr/></td><td align="center">3 (6)<hr/></td><td align="center">(&#x02212;)<hr/></td><td align="center">(&#x02212;)<hr/></td><td align="center">Recurrence<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">3<hr/></td><td align="center">59<hr/></td><td align="center">F<hr/></td><td align="center">Chin on chest<hr/></td><td align="center">C<hr/></td><td align="center">Urinary cancer<hr/></td><td align="center">Wake up<hr/></td><td align="center">2 (5)<hr/></td><td align="center">None<hr/></td><td align="center">None<hr/></td><td align="center">(++)<hr/></td><td align="center">(&#x02212;)<hr/></td><td align="center">Operation<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">4<hr/></td><td align="center">79<hr/></td><td align="center">F<hr/></td><td align="center">Chin on chest supported by hand<hr/></td><td align="center">C<hr/></td><td align="center">Goiter<hr/></td><td align="center">3 days<hr/></td><td align="center">3 (12)<hr/></td><td align="center">2 (7)<hr/></td><td align="center">None<hr/></td><td align="center">(++)<hr/></td><td align="center">(+)<hr/></td><td align="center">Improved<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">5<hr/></td><td align="center">70<hr/></td><td align="center">F<hr/></td><td align="center">Chin on chest supported by hand<hr/></td><td align="center">C<hr/></td><td align="center">None<hr/></td><td align="center">2 days<hr/></td><td align="center">2 (4)<hr/></td><td align="center">2 (7)<hr/></td><td align="center">None<hr/></td><td align="center">(&#x02212;)<hr/></td><td align="center">(&#x02212;)<hr/></td><td align="center">Improved<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">6<hr/></td><td align="center">69<hr/></td><td align="center">M<hr/></td><td align="center">Chin on chest<hr/></td><td align="center">D<hr/></td><td align="center">Gastric ulcer<hr/></td><td align="center">Wake up<hr/></td><td align="center">2 (0.1)<hr/></td><td align="center">1 (5)<hr/></td><td align="center">2 (6)<hr/></td><td align="center">(++)<hr/></td><td align="center">(+)<hr/></td><td align="center">Recurrence<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">7<hr/></td><td align="center">55<hr/></td><td align="center">F<hr/></td><td align="center">Chin on chest<hr/></td><td align="center">C<hr/></td><td align="center">Insomnia<hr/></td><td align="center">Wake up<hr/></td><td align="center">3 (24)<hr/></td><td align="center">None<hr/></td><td align="center">None<hr/></td><td align="center">(++)<hr/></td><td align="center">(&#x02212;)<hr/></td><td align="center">Operation<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">75</td><td align="center">F</td><td align="center">Chin on chest</td><td align="center">C</td><td align="center">Breast cancer</td><td align="center">Wake up</td><td align="center">3 (0.1)</td><td align="center">2 (2)</td><td align="center">3 (1)</td><td align="center">(++)</td><td align="center">(+)</td><td align="center">Recurrence</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>1st Interv = first intervention since DHS onset;

Six cases (cases 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8) were accompanied by cervical pain at onset, which then lessened within 1 week. One case (case 5) presented with the deformity at 2 days after falling down. Three cases (cases 2, 4, 5) needed to support their chin by hand. All cases were treated with physiotherapy, together with the combination of a cervical brace, for at least 3 months. Six cases (cases 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8) showed improvement, and their first interventions were between 0.1 and 12 months (average: 3.6 months), although 3 cases (cases 2, 6, 8) had recurrence (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The two unimproved cases (cases 3, 7) underwent surgery of combined anterior and posterior cervical fixation, and their first interventions were at 5 and 24 months.

The type D (cases 2, 6) cases (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) had recurring horizontal gaze disturbance after initial recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Imaging Findings</title><p>By short-time inversion recovery (STIR) MRI findings, high signal intensity was present at the cervical extensor muscle or interspinous space in 7 cases (cases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8), which then changed to isosignal intensity in 3 of the cases (cases 1, 4, 5). One case (case 6) showed high signal intensity at the intervertebral space and facet joint, which then had decreased 6 months later. Echography was performed in 4 cases (cases 2, 5, 7, 8) and pathological examinations in 3 cases (cases 2, 3, 8).

However, 6 months after the improvement, his horizontal gaze disturbance worsened again (Grade 3). At 2 months after the recurrence, cervical plain radiography and echography showed elongation of the C6&#x02013;7 interspinous and nuchal ligaments.

In 1996, Jaster et al. reported a case of natural recovery of myogenic cervical kyphosis (myogenic head drop) in 24 months.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Previous literature mentioned that positive outcome by observation/bracing/physical therapy was 18.2% (6/33 cases)<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and 20.9% (14/67 cases).<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> In the current study, 4 of 8 cases showed improvement in their horizontal gaze disturbance, and sudden-onset DHS had a better prognosis.</p><p>With respect to the onset of DHS, many cases were accompanied by cervical pain and hard-to-extend cervical spine at that time. After a few weeks, the cervical pain had decreased. Initial MRI findings showed high signal intensity in cervical extensor tissue in 7 of 8 cases, and follow-up MRI showed decreased signal intensity in 3 of the 7 cases. Previous literature has reported that fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI showed diffuse muscular edema of the cervical extensor muscles.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Echography and pathological findings during the chronic phase revealed the presence of angiogenesis in the elongated interspinous space. Pathological findings from muscle biopsy revealed fiber degeneration, regeneration, and necrosis with scattered inflammatory cells, which were similar to results of the previous report.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Based on those findings, sudden-onset DHS is likely associated with acute cervical soft tissue damage and muscle weakness due to degenerative change.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In chronic phase, the regenerative process may occur, while causing angiogenesis, and some DHS cases could develop irreversible change caused by muscle fibrous degeneration.</p><p>The influence of cervical orthosis on the outcome was unclear because compliance varied depending on the cases. However, the present study does suggest that early intervention would be helpful for the improvement of DHS. The first interventions for the 2 unrecovered cases were delayed (4 and 24 months) in comparison with the recovered 6 cases (average: 3.6 months) (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Early intervention (physiotherapy, orthosis) can prevent recurrent hyperelongation of the extensor muscles. From the pathological findings, it was evident that damaged muscle fibers would finally be replaced by collagen fibers. At early periods after onset, posture training to stabilize the upright position is very important. If global spinal alignment could not be maintained, a worse prognosis would be expected. In the present study, 2 cases needed to undergo surgery (cases 3, 7). Because their first intervention was more than 4 months after onset, conservative treatment was not effective at all.</p><p>Regarding global spinal alignment, type C was noted in 6 cases and type D in 2 cases of sudden-onset DHS. The 2 type D DHS cases showed recurrence of horizontal gaze disturbance following initial improvement (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). When DHS coincides with positive global imbalance (type D), physiotherapy should be included at the lumbopelvic region in addition to cervicothoracic exercise in order to regain their global spinal alignment. Global imbalance leads to concerns of causing excessive load to the cervical constructs, resulting in a possible recurrence of horizontal gaze disturbance. Even if the initial clinical findings showed improvement, it should be noted that the recurrence rate was high.</p><p>Examinations by cervical and global radiograph, MRI, and echography should be recommended initially and at 3 to 6 months after onset. Biopsy would be needed in cases of poor recovery. When surgical intervention is required, those findings will provide helpful information for establishing a prognosis based on conservative treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Lessons</title><p>Sudden-onset DHS occurred in 12.1% (8/66) of DHS cases due to INEM.

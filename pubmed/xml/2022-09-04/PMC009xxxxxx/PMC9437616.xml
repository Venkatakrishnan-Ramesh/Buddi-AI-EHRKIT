The patient is positioned in the beach chair position. A longitudinal incision is made over the lateral third of the clavicle. The platysma muscle and deltotrapezial fascia are carefully dissected and the coracoid process is palpated anteriorly to the distal third of the clavicle. Under fluoroscopic guidance, 2 bicortical tunnels are drilled with a 2.8-mm drill, and 2 all-suture anchors are placed and armed underneath the inferior cortex of the coracoid process; The anterior anchor is double loaded with a tape or a simple suture, and the posterior anchor is triple loaded. With the same 2.8-mm drill, 2 vertical tunnels are drilled on the clavicle, approximately 2.5 and 3.5&#x000a0;cm medially to the acromioclavicular joint line. Two additional tunnels are drilled in the anterior-to-posterior direction, one crossing the lateral edge of the clavicle and another crossing the anterior acromion. Using a nitinol wire, one of the limbs of the anterior anchor is introduced in the acromion&#x02019;s horizontal tunnel, from anterior to posterior. The remaining limb is passed over the clavicle and introduced in the clavicular horizontal tunnel, from posterior to anterior. Two sutures of the posterior coracoid anchor (4 limbs) are passed through the medial vertical clavicular tunnel. The remaining posterior anchor suture and one suture from the anterior anchor are passed through the lateral vertical clavicular tunnel (4 limbs). The arm is positioned in a &#x0201c;shoulder shrug&#x0201d; position to facilitate acromioclavicular joint reduction under minimum tension. The vertical tunnels sutures are passed and tied over two 1.4-mm cortical buttons one carefully placed over each drill hole. The tape is tied in a figure of 8 around the acromioclavicular joint. To reinforce the circular construct, the tape limbs of the figure of 8 knot are tied to the suture limbs of the lateral button. Dynamic joint stability is tested under direct visualization and under fluoroscopy. The deltotrapezial fascia is closed and plicated over the joint capsule.

The fluoroscope is positioned contralaterally to the operated shoulder, and its position and ability to obtain a clear 10&#x000b0; cephalic tilt view of the operated ACJ is assessed before surgical draping. The upper limb and ipsilateral upper hemithorax are prepared and draped in a sterile fashion.

The platysma muscle and deltotrapezial fascia are carefully dissected, and the latter is referenced for further incorporation in the final repair construct. The lateral third of the clavicle is released of soft-tissue attachments, while sparing the trapezius insertion near the posterior capsule of the ACJ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The coracoid process and coracoclavicular ligaments remnants are visualized and palpated anteriorly to the distal third of the clavicle, avoiding exhaustive dissection in this area to spare the remaining torn coracoclavicular ligaments (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> and <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Video 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Coracoclavicular Preparation</title><p id="p0030">This step should occur before ACJ reduction, as the posterior displacement of the clavicle facilitates both the coracoid process approach and anchor placement.

The second anchor, triple-loaded with 3 sutures (YKnot RC triple loaded #2 Hi-Fi Sutures), is placed posteriorly, close to the base of the coracoid. Care should be taken not to place the 2 anchors too close to one another to avoid the risk of coracoid fracture (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). Immediately after placement, the anterior anchor is referenced with a hemostat clamp and the posterior anchor is referenced with a Kocher clamp. With the same 2.8-mm drill, 2 vertical tunnels are drilled on the clavicle, approximately 2.5 and 3.5-cm medially to the ACJ line, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Acromioclavicular (AC) Preparation</title><p id="p0035">The ACJ meniscus, if present, is identified and excised (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).

More recently, the importance of AC ligaments and capsule repair has been highlighted due to their central role in ACJ horizontal and rotational stability, and many different stabilization methods have been proposed.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In the current Technical Note, the authors describe a technique designed to stabilize both the&#x000a0;coracoclavicular and the acromioclavicular components, addressing the joint as a coracoacromioclavicular osteoligamentous complex, closing the circle of tridimensional stability. When both coracoclavicular and acromioclavicular ligaments are compromised, the clavicle is pulled upwards and backwards by the unopposed action of the upper trapezius. This deformity is aggravated by active scapular protraction, as the clavicle becomes completely detached from the scapula and is unable to follow scapular motion.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> The current technique offers a strong, nonrigid, multivectorial stabilization that is designed to not only re-establish coracoclavicular and acromioclavicular attachments, but also to directly counteract upper trapezius vectorial forces, simultaneously bringing the clavicle anteriorly and inferiorly (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>) and simulating the circle of stability brought together by the lateral clavicle, the acromion, the coracoid process and the coracoclavicular, acromioclavicular and coracoacromial ligaments. This is an open technique with no need for a time- and resource-consuming arthroscopic setting (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In fact, most arthroscopically assisted techniques require an equally invasive open approach to the lateral clavicle, the AC ligaments and capsule, and the deltotrapezial fascia. The use of all-suture anchors as a cortical buttress in the inferior surface of the coracoid process allows for an easy fluoroscopic-guided implant positioning, with no need for arthroscopic visualization, and avoids the use of metallic hardware and the potential complications that can follow (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).<table-wrap position="float"

<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2"><caption><title>Video 1</title><p>Exemplification of the surgical treatment of a type IIIB acromioclavicular joint dislocation on a left shoulder, using the Closing-the-Circle technique. The patient is positioned in the beach chair position. A longitudinal incision is made over the lateral third of the clavicle. The platysma muscle and deltotrapezial fascia are carefully dissected and the coracoid process is palpated anteriorly to the distal third of the clavicle. Under fluoroscopic guidance, 2 bicortical tunnels are drilled with a 2.8-mm drill, and 2 all-suture anchors are placed and armed underneath the inferior cortex of the coracoid process; The anterior anchor is double loaded with a tape or a simple suture, and the posterior anchor is triple loaded. With the same 2.8-mm drill, 2 vertical tunnels are drilled on the clavicle, approximately 2.5 and 3.5&#x000a0;cm medially to the acromioclavicular joint line. Two additional tunnels are drilled in the anterior-to-posterior direction, one crossing the lateral edge of the clavicle and another crossing the anterior acromion. Using a nitinol wire, one of the limbs of the anterior anchor is introduced in the acromion&#x02019;s horizontal tunnel, from anterior to posterior. The remaining limb is passed over the clavicle and introduced in the clavicular horizontal tunnel, from posterior to anterior. Two sutures of the posterior coracoid anchor (4 limbs) are passed through the medial vertical clavicular tunnel. The remaining posterior anchor suture and one suture from the anterior anchor are passed through the lateral vertical clavicular tunnel (4 limbs). The arm is positioned in a &#x0201c;shoulder shrug&#x0201d; position to facilitate acromioclavicular joint reduction under minimum tension. The vertical tunnels sutures are passed and tied over two 1.4-mm cortical buttons one carefully placed over each drill hole. The tape is tied in a figure of 8 around the acromioclavicular joint. To reinforce the circular construct, the tape limbs of the figure of 8 knot are tied to the suture limbs of the lateral button. Dynamic joint stability is tested under direct visualization and under fluoroscopy. The deltotrapezial fascia is closed and plicated over the joint capsule. The skin is closed using an intradermal suture technique. The final construct closes the circle of coracoacromioclavicular stability.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.mp4"/></supplementary-material>

Clinical examination showed normal range of motion (ROM) associated with a decrease of the grip strength. Dynamic maneuvers of the wrist showed a minimal instability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ), along with pain on fovea palpation and during the stress test. Radiographs showed bilateral long ulnar styloid with a small medial incisure for the triquetrum. The right side the posterior ulnar corner of the distal radius showed a small bone detachment. Lateral view was normal without dorsal subluxation of the ulnar head. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a lunate bone edema due to ulno-carpal conflict and arthrosynovitis in the ulnar side and a radial central discontinuity of the TFCC close to the radius. Wrist function according with MMWS was evaluated before surgery.

Consequently, this rupture was not amenable to the technique of transosseous repair, which is commonly proposed for type 1D tears. Therefore, an alternative technique of suture was adopted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Starting from the palmar RU ligament, a 21&#x000a0;G shuttle needle was used to pass a 2/0 Nylon Monofilament (Ethicon ETHILON), a nonabsorbable suture through the tear from the ulnar side toward the radial stump, still attached to the radius. A second shuttle needle with a suture loop was introduced in the same manner and direction, parallel to the previous one. Both the Nylon suture and the loop were retrieved outside the joint. The suture was loaded on the loop, which was then pulled backward, so that the Nylon suture crossed the tear. Procedure was done for the palmar and dorsal RU ligaments. Then the extremities of both the Nylon sutures were knotted on the ulnar side, close to the pre-styloid recess, achieving a strong repair of both RU ligaments. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Arthroscopy was recorded, and the video demonstrates the technique (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Video 1</xref>). At the end of the repair, prono-supination was tested, and clinical stability was checked.<fig id="fig3"><label>Fig 3</label><caption><p>Artist rendering of surgical technique.

Finally, the suture is transported outside the ulnar part of the TFCC retrieving the last needle (C). Procedure is repeated for dorsal branch (D).

We supposed that the injury was caused by a crush-traction of the ligament between the head of the ulna and the lunate (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;8</xref>). The trauma was, probably, so violent that it broke not only the central disc of the TFCC but also the palmar and dorsal RU ligaments. The arthroscopic appearance of a clear-cut transverse tear passing from the dorsal to the palmar RU ligaments, also involving the central disc, sustained our hypothesis. Since the lesion of the ligament was localized in its midsubstance, at about 1&#x000a0;cm from the radius itself, not at the bony insertion of the radius, a soft tissue repair technique was required using an unconventional but efficient arthroscopic method. Considering that the two branches converge in the ulnar part or at the ulnar fovea, it was decided to perform a volar-ulnar surgical approach at the site of the 6U and DF portals. After we exposed the site and identified the convergence site of the two branches under arthroscopic control, the repair technique was performed using two shuttle needles for each branch to transport and take back the sutures, respectively. The knot-tying was made at the convergence site of the two branches, close to the prestyloid recess.<fig id="fig8"><label>Fig 8</label><caption><p>Artist rendering of injury mechanism. Patient wrist (A) sustained a violent trauma with crushing traction of the ligament between the head of the ulna and the lunate (B and C), which caused a rupture of the central disc and the dorsal and

<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2"><caption><title>Video 1</title><p>Surgical technique demonstration: Arthroscopy was performed with standard set-up, using a 1.9-mm wide-angle video arthroscope. With the scope in the 3-4 portal, an unusual triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear was found at ulnocarpal exploration. The TFCC had a clear sharp transverse rupture on its radial part, involving both the volar and the dorsal radioulnar (RU) ligaments at 0.5 and 1&#x000a0;cm, respectively, from its insertion to the ulnar border of the radius. A new suture technique was adopted. Starting from the palmar RU ligament, a 21&#x000a0;G shuttle needle was used to pass a 2/0 nylon monofilament, a nonabsorbable suture through the tear from the ulnar side toward the radial stump, still attached to the radius. A second shuttle needle with a suture loop was introduced in the same manner and direction, parallel to the previous one. Both the Nylon suture and the loop were retrieved outside the joint. The suture loaded on the loop, which was then pulled backward so that the nylon suture crossed the tear. The procedure was done for the palmar and dorsal RU ligaments. Then the extremities of both the nylon sutures were knotted on the ulnar side, close to the prestyloid recess, achieving a strong repair of both RU ligaments. The arthroscopic second look, showed the well-healed RU ligaments and the debrided central lesion. The knots and the sutures were removed with ease.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.mp4"/></supplementary-material>

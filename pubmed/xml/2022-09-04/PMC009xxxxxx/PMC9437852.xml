</p><sec id="sec1.1"><title>State of paratransit</title><p id="p0060">Over the years, <italic>paratransit</italic> has become one of the most dominant forms of transport in Africa, providing countless jobs and cheap transport for millions of people every day. Paratransit is a mode of informal public transport, owned by small operators, and which does not follow fixed schedules or routes, but rather adapts to passenger demand. Paratransit is characteristic of African cities and accounts for over 70% of the modal share (excluding non-motorized modes of transport) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Behrens et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0065">Although paratransit in the region takes various forms, such as minibus taxis, motorcycle taxis, and tuk-tuks (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Ehebrecht et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>), minibus taxis, in particular have become ubiquitous throughout Africa. They are able to carry many passengers (9&#x02013;16, depending on the vehicle model) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Behrens et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>) and, moreover, they are available at a low cost as second-hand imports from developed countries (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Cervigni et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, p. 348). Unfortunately, this has led to the system being fraught with old, under-maintained vehicles, causing serious environmental concerns. One study done in 12 African cities found that the average age of minibus taxis was 15 years (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Powered by internal combustion engines, these vehicles contribute substantially to the emission of greenhouse gases and a general decline of air quality in African cities (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Collett and Hirmer, 2021</xref>).</p><p id="p0070">Part of the reason that Africa&#x02019;s public transport is in this state is that there has been very little regulation of the paratransit industry. The paratransit industry originated from the collapse of state-owned public transport throughout the continent, during the restructuring of World Bank policies in the 1990s (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kumar, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Cervero and Golub, 2007</xref>). As a result, paratransit grew organically to fill this vacuum. By the time governments sought to control the transition, the system had already grown to a size that made it resistant to change (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Behrens et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jennings and Behrens, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0075">Although there is a lack of regulation, it does create the advantage that the system has low barriers to entry, encouraging small businesses to enter the market. However, taxi operators also misuse this freedom to cut costs in taxi maintenance to squeeze profits from this relatively flooded market. At the same time, the urban poor have resigned to the poor standards of transport because they cannot afford any better.</p><p id="p0080">Some countries have made various interventions to try to improve the quality, safety, and environmental footprint of these vehicles. Although some of these countries have attempted to establish control through regulation, this has often failed because of poor enforcement or resistance from taxi operators. <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al. (2008</xref>, Sec. 3) give an overview of failed regulation attempts in various African cities. In other cases, countries have tried to financially subsidize the sector to upgrade their fleets. <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al. (2008</xref>, Table&#x000a0;2.2) provide a few such examples. This has been successful in relatively economically advanced countries such as South Africa, which incentivized taxi owners with around USD 7500&#x02009;to scrap their old taxis and replace them with newer and safer vehicles (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Behrens et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). However, in most African countries paratransit subsidies do not exist and would be unaffordable by the government (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).</p><p id="p0085">Some countries have also tried to override the paratransit industry by competing against it with more formal modes of mass transit, such as metro rail, bus rapid transit, and the like. However, these have been fraught with poor government spending, poor integration with existing paratransit, and general incompatibility with the dynamic transport needs of the urban poor. All this has led to formal mass transit being a burden on the taxpayer (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Stead and Pojani, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>State of electric vehicles in Africa</title><p id="p0090">The market penetration of electric vehicles has been extremely low in Africa. For example, South Africa had fewer than 1200&#x02009;electric vehicles as recorded in 2019 (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">IEA, 2020</xref>). It can be seen that the electric vehicle revolution has largely been a trend in developed countries. However, this trend will inevitably find its way to Africa, because of Africa&#x02019;s high reliance on vehicle imports from developed countries (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">IEA, 2021</xref>, p. 45). (60% of light-duty vehicles in the continent are second-hand imports from developed countries.) In 2021, although electric vehicle sales in Africa were extremely low, it increased by 90% with respect to 2020 values (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">IEA, 2022</xref>). It is only a matter of time before the African transport landscape is transformed.</p><p id="p0095">In order for the successful migration of Africa&#x02019;s transport to electric vehicle technology, it is important that the methods are not copied from developed countries. Rather the blueprint needs to be adapted and re-worked in order to fit the context of Africa. The context of Africa is severely different from developed countries because of at least three reasons (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Collett et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Booysen et&#x000a0;al., 2022a</xref>):<list list-type="simple" id="olist0010"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p id="p0100">Vastly different mobility/traffic patterns and modal share.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0015"><label>2.</label><p id="p0105">Low availability of electric utility.</p></list-item><list-item id="o0020"><label>3.</label><p id="p0110">Limited capital availability, both on the utility end and the customer end.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0115">However, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Collett et&#x000a0;al.

In addition, the expectation for electric vehicles is set, as evidenced by the extensive database for electric vehicle policies for 52 African countries by the <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">United Nations Environment Programme (2018)</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Data for paratransit sustainability</title><p id="p0120">To improve the state of African paratransit in future, a different approach needs to be taken. One paradigm through which to achieve sustainable mobility is the three-pronged &#x0201c;Avoid-Shift-Improve&#x0201d; approach (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Transformative Urban Mobility Initiative, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Galuszka et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). This paradigm follows three steps. The first is to <italic>avoid</italic> inefficiencies. For example, this can be done by reducing redundant taxi trips through computer optimization. The second step is to <italic>shift</italic> to alternative technologies (e.g., electric vehicles). The software presented in this article can be used to investigate the energy demands of various technologies to select the best alternative. Finally, the last step is to continuously <italic>improve</italic> the new technology through various efficiency upgrades. For example, an electric paratransit system can be enhanced with more and/or faster charging stations, integration of solar energy charging, and more efficient vehicles. All three of these steps require adequate data to drive the process.</p><p id="p0125">Unfortunately, instances of large-scale capture of paratransit data are scarce, leading to poor decision making (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Collett and Hirmer, 2021</xref>).

In the case of paratransit, schedules and routes are fluid and based on the demand. Hence, it becomes necessary to collect sufficient data to synthesize &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; routes and schedules within a boundary of confidence. The GTFS standard has provisions to capture (1) the shapes of the various routes, (2) location, arrival time, and duration of stops along each route, and (3) what times of the day a taxi departs on each route.</p><p id="p0145">The popular approach for capturing these data for paratransit systems is the one pioneered by <italic>The Digital Matatu Project</italic> (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Williams et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). This approach employs data collectors equipped with mobile phones who ride on the taxis to collect data. As the data collector makes a trip on a particular route, the mobile phone records the path taken and the data collector will make a record when the taxi stops to drop off or pick up passengers. The advantage of this is that, ethical concerns notwithstanding, very little permission is required from the taxi association to collect data because nothing is installed on the vehicles. As a result, the capital costs of the data captured is minimized.</p><p id="p0150">However, there are some major disadvantages with this approach. First, the data is only valid for as long as the paratransit system continues to follow the same movement patterns. However, in reality, paratransit movement patterns often adapt to the evolving demand of its customers. Therefore, data will need to be re-captured at regular intervals to keep the dataset up to date. Although unskilled labor is often cheap in Africa&#x02019;s developing countries, the cost can quickly compound because of the number of person-hours required to collect the data. This could be the reason that none of the datasets we analyzed have been updated since their initial release.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3.3"><title>Digital transport for Africa dataset</title><p id="p0155"><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">DigitalTransport4Africa (2021b)</xref> (DT4A) is a concerted effort to collect GTFS data for paratransit systems in African cities.

For example, Cairo has the highest simulated energy usage, and it also has a high expected energy demand. Abidjan has the lowest simulated energy usage, and it also has a low expected energy demand. The only results that did not correspond well were for Harare and Kampala. Harare had a higher simulated energy usage than expected, whereas Kampala had a lower simulated energy usage than expected. This can be attributed to the fact that both of those datasets had a low reliability rating in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>.</p><p id="p0280">We conclude that GTFS data can be used to give a rough estimate of the order of magnitude of a paratransit system&#x02019;s energy demands. However, because of the current state of data quality, they are likely to be unreliable for quantifying the exact energy demands, as shown in the next section.</p><p id="p0285">The original intention was to approximate the expected energy demand using the number of taxis in each paratransit system. However, this proved to be difficult because of unreliable numbers found for this metric because the transport authorities in most of the countries do not publish it. We therefore relied on independent sources, whose figures do not agree. For example, Harare&#x02019;s transport authority did not publish any figure on the number of taxis, and the figure of 100,000&#x02009;which we found from an independent source seems disproportionate when one takes into account the city&#x02019;s population size. In addition, that number was the most recent we could find, although it is from 2002. This highlights, once again, the need for some level of systematic data collection.</p><p id="p0290">Reliable statistics on the number of taxis would have also been useful for downscaling the power and energy profiles in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>, to get the average taxi&#x02019;s energy demand. In the following paragraphs, we will nevertheless downscale the Kampala profile by the number of taxis to compare its power profile to one we computed from independently gathered, reliable, vehicle-based paratransit data (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Booysen et&#x000a0;al., 2022b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Passenger-based data shortcomings</title><p id="p0295">Transport engineers typically obtain information by employing people in two outdated ways, either by standing next to the road to record inflows and outflows or by getting into vehicles to act as human carriers of tracking devices. These methods are particularly attractive in developing countries where operational traffic monitoring infrastructure is sparse and cheap labor is abundant. But, as mentioned in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>, this shortcut has many pitfalls.</p><p id="p0300">Developments in vehicle tracking technology have changed the way in which data can be captured. Although the setup cost is more, tracking devices have the substantial advantage that they are not susceptible to human behavioral problems. For example, they do not wake up late, get tired and need eating breaks, and they do not sleep.</p><p id="p0305">To illustrate the difference, in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> we show Kampala&#x02019;s energy profile from the two vantage points. The overlay shows two plots. One is the passenger-based power profile from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C, which was downscaled by the number of taxis in Kampala (25,000, as shown in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;5</xref> (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Spooner et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>)). The second plot is a <italic>vehicle-based</italic> power profile of Kampala obtained in a small study by <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Booysen et&#x000a0;al. (2022b)</xref>. The differences are stark. First, the vehicle-based dataset reveals that the taxis started moving at around 4&#x02009;AM, before the fieldworkers managed to get on board in the passenger-based dataset. Second, the passenger-based profile grinds to a halt just before dinner time. But the vehicle-based profile shows that the minibus taxis are mobile, even more so than in the morning, until after 9&#x02009;PM. This makes passenger-based data unreliable for estimating the stop times (and hence the charging requirements) of the taxis.<fig id="fig3"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Comparison of Kampala per-vehicle power profiles derived from passenger-based and vehicle-based data</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p><p id="p0310">Using the passenger-based data to estimate the charging requirements is also made difficult by the fact that the data does not track the individual taxis. Hence, although we know that there was a lull of activity at around midday for some of the datasets, we don&#x02019;t know which taxis were stopped at that time. Even if one is to assume that all vehicles were captured <italic>while mobile</italic> by tracking passengers, there is no way to tell exactly <italic>when</italic> each vehicle was actually stationary, <italic>how long</italic> the vehicle was stationary and <italic>where</italic> it was stationary. All of this information is required to quantify the charging requirements of the taxis on the grid, and is only reliably available through vehicle-based data capture.</p><p id="p0315">Clearly, if we make assumptions about the power profile and energy requirements of electric minibus taxis from passenger-based data, we will be wrong by a substantial margin. This adds weight to the statement by Collett and Hirmer that we quoted earlier, stressing the need for a more systematic approach to data collection for the purpose of planning the decarbonization of paratransit (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Collett and Hirmer, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p id="p0320">Climate change is forcing the world to adapt to new, cleaner technologies, especially in the transport sector, which contributes a large share of carbon emissions. Developed countries have committed to ambitious plans to reduce their emissions in the short term, and are turning away from fossil fuel vehicles. Eventually, developing countries will be compelled to do the same, and must be prepared for such big changes.</p><p id="p0325">This article prepares for this eventual migration by providing a method for modeling and simulating electric paratransit, Africa&#x02019;s most used mode of motorized transport (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Behrens et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Using this method, this article has attempted to establish the energy requirements that paratransit would have on the electric utilities of several cities across Africa. Publicly available GTFS data was used for the simulations to evaluate how the state of the art can be improved for future evaluations, and whether the approach of paratransit data collection should be changed.</p><p id="p0330">The first objective was to establish the net energy demand that the paratransit systems would have on each of the cities. This was plotted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> and summarized in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>. Although the presented method was able to obtain the net energy demands of the paratransit systems, our evaluation of the data collection processes revealed a few quality issues, pointing to potentially unreliable data. Therefore, we propose more rigorous approaches in future paratransit data collection projects. Despite this, the results still give an <italic>indication</italic> of what the future energy demand would look like and what the taxis&#x02019; movement profiles would look like.</p><p id="p0335">Four of the cities (Harare, Kampala, Nairobi, and Freetown) indicate that the highest energy demand of the taxis is at around 9&#x02009;AM. This would indicate that taxis have a period of high activity in the so-called &#x0201c;morning rush&#x0201d;. It is clear therefore that taxis need to be adequately charged overnight to sustain this high-activity period. Three of these cities also indicate a high-activity period in the evening. This would mean that the taxis may also need to charge around midday when there is a period of relative inactivity.</p><p id="p0340">Although we know the periods of relative inactivity, we don&#x02019;t know exactly how long the typical taxi stops. This is because the data does not capture the individual taxis&#x02019; itineraries. Rather, it gives the perspective from an infrastructure, passenger demand, and traffic modeling point of view. Specifically, it captures the itinerary and frequency of each route and assumes that taxis will be available to service the route. Therefore, because we do not know when the taxis stop, it is not possible to know exactly when and how much the peak strain on the electric grid would be due to the charging of the vehicles. To do this, tracking data of the individual taxis will be required. At best, with this data, we have an indication that the peak charging strain on the grid would be approximately the peak power usage from the electric vehicles, but a few hours later.</p><p id="p0345">If there were tracking data of the individual taxis, we would know exactly which routes they serve during the day, and how long their breaks are between routes. We would then be able to profile the individual taxis&#x02019; daily energy requirements which would be useful for calculating the battery size required for the taxis. This would have also been possible to find this metric through the GTFS data, if we knew the number of taxis operating the paratransit systems. However, statistics on the number of taxis operating in the cities are unreliable.</p><p id="p0350">To evaluate the renewable energy generation capacity that is needed to supplement the grid to charge the taxis, we would need to know the stopping times of the taxis. Because most renewable energy resources are time-variant, the exact stopping times and durations are important. From the GTFS data, we have identified that, in some of the cities, the taxis have a dip in activity at midday, which presents an opportunity for charging from solar energy. However, to quantify exactly how much solar resource is required, the stopping times need to be known.</p><p id="p0355">In conclusion, the GTFS data that seems to be the state of the art in paratransit data capture is useful in giving us an idea of the total energy requirements of a paratransit system, in giving <italic>indications</italic> of the supply-side energy requirements, in <italic>estimating</italic> the distributed battery resource available to the electric network, and in <italic>identifying opportunities</italic> for charging the taxis through renewable energy generation. However, the data quality needs to be improved to establish enough confidence in the data to <italic>quantify</italic> these energy requirements and opportunities with a scientific level of accuracy. More rigor needs to be applied when collecting the data, possibly by increasing the number of field workers and the number of times data is collected on each route. The results clearly indicate that it is not possible to identify the per-vehicle energy requirements from GTFS data. Although an attempt was made to scale down the power profile by the number of taxis, we found that the result did not correspond satisfactorily with independently gathered GPS tracking data. This has highlighted the issues of human data collection, calling for a more systematic, autonomous approach to capture data. With all this in mind, the authors recommend that future data collection efforts employ the vehicle-based strategy (e.g., through GPS trackers). Through higher quality data driving the process of decision making, we can finally compute our way toward sustainable mobility in Africa.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="p0360">Publicly available GTFS data was used for to evaluate the energy requirements and whether this approach of paratransit data collection should be changed.

And lastly, we verified the results by checking their correspondence to the input data.</p><sec id="sec4.3.1"><title>Data retrieval and verification</title><p id="p0395">GTFS datasets were obtained for eleven African cities from the publicly available paratransit data collection (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">DigitalTransport4Africa, 2021b</xref>). The data was then inspected to ensure that the datasets were fully defined according to the GTFS standard. Out of these datasets, four datasets were failed the validation process, as they were missing the datafile which describes the routes followed by the vehicles. The remaining seven datasets successfully described the schedules, routes, and stop locations of minibus taxis.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3.2"><title>Data reliability analysis</title><p id="p0400">Although the methods described in this article should be extendable to any other form of public transport that can be described in the GTFS specification, minibus taxis is unique in that it is highly unregulated. Because of this, the compilers of these GTFS datasets were required to do their own data collection to compile their GTFS datasets. This meant that different approaches were used in this process, each with varying degrees of scientific rigor and reliability.</p><p id="p0405">Therefore, the first step was to inspect the datasets and the methods used to compile them, to evaluate their reliability in a systematic way. As discussed in the introduction, a few methods of paratransit data collection exist. We analyzed publications on each dataset and contacted the dataset compilers to establish the details of the methods used to collect the seven datasets. All datasets were compiled using the approach of deploying human data collectors into the field. Because none existed, we identified quality metrics of how the data was collected and how much effort was put into collecting the data and keeping it up to date. These include:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0025"><list-item id="u0065"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0410">Whether data collection was <italic>passenger-based</italic> or <italic>roadside-based</italic>:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0030"><list-item id="u0070"><label>&#x025cb;</label><p id="p0415"><italic>Passenger-based</italic> data collection means that the collectors boarded the minibuses as passengers, and recorded data by traveling the various routes.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0075"><label>&#x025cb;</label><p id="p0420"><italic>Roadside-based</italic> data collection means that the collectors stood at the various terminals, recording the frequency at which taxis arrive and depart.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item id="u0080"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0425">Months since last update: Indicates whether the dataset is being kept up to date.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0085"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0430">Number of human data collectors: More data collectors would indicate more effort put into collecting the data.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0090"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0435">Number of weeks of data collection: A longer data collection period would indicate more effort put into collecting the data.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0440">We tabulated these metrics for each of the seven cities for which data collection methodology was known to compare the rigor with which their data was captured. Furthermore, we classified the effort behind each dataset into three categories: high, medium and low. We classified datasets with less than 50 person-weeks as low effort, less than 100 person-weeks as medium effort, and above 100 person-weeks as high effort. Unfortunately, the actual values of the thresholds had to be rather arbitrarily chosen. The values of the person-weeks metric does not have much practical significance because of the fact that the actual data collection effort is dependent on substantially more factors than the number of data collectors and the number of weeks of data collection. However, the person-weeks metric is useful for providing a starting point for classifying the data collection effort, which will ultimately be a qualitative judgment call by the researcher. This is unfortunately a consequence to the fact that the datasets do not provide detailed, uniform information regarding the methods and rigor in which they were collected. .</p><p id="p0445">However, to make a fair comparison of the reliability of the datasets, it was also necessary to capture metrics that would illustrate the size of each dataset. A larger dataset would naturally require more effort to capture. Hence, another table was generated with the following metrics to describe the size of each dataset:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0035"><list-item id="u0095"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0450">Number of routes: The data capturers would need to make at least one trip on each route of the paratransit system. Hence, more routes there are, the more effort required to complete the data capturing project.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0100"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0455">Number of trips per day: Each day, multiple trips are taken on a particular route. This metric summarizes how many trips are taken per day across all routes of the transport system.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0105"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0460">Geographic spread of the transport system: This is the area in <inline-formula><mml:math id="M5" altimg="si4.gif"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>km</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of the transport system, as derived from the dataset. This is calculated by creating a bounding box from the minimum and maximum coordinates that are recorded in the transport system&#x02019;s route definitions, and calculating the area of that bounding box. A larger geographical spread would indicate that the routes are longer. A longer route would probably require more time to capture than a shorter route.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0465">We therefore classified the size of each dataset as small, medium or large. For example, a dataset with many routes and a large geographic area would be classified as &#x0201c;large&#x0201d;. We multiplied the routes with the area (in <inline-formula><mml:math id="M6" altimg="si4.gif"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>km</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) for each of the datasets. If the resulting value was below 200,000, it was classified as small. Values below 400,000 were classified as medium, and values above 400,000 were classified as large. Once again, the values of these thresholds are arbitrary.</p><p id="p0470">From these classifications, it was possible to evaluate the reliability of each of the datasets by comparing the effort exerted to the dataset size. If the level of effort was less than the dataset size, then the dataset&#x02019;s reliability was classified as &#x0201c;low&#x0201d;. If the effort was equivalent to the level of the dataset size, then its reliability was classified as &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d;. If the effort exceeded the level of the dataset size, then its reliability was classified as &#x0201c;high&#x0201d;. For example, a medium sized dataset would have its reliability classified as &#x0201c;low&#x0201d; if the effort was low, &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d; if the effort was medium, and &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; if the effort was high.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3.3"><title>Minibus taxi mobility modeling from data</title><p id="p0475">For each of the cities, the following method was used to create a simulation-ready model from the data:</p><p id="p0480">The first step was to obtain geographical data that would describe the road network and terrain that the paratransit system operates in. We were able to utilize a free dataset developed by OpenStreetMap (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">OpenStreetMap Contributors, 2022</xref>). The download server stores the data as one file per country. Therefore, we were forced to download the data for the whole country in which the city lies (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Geofabrik, 2022</xref>). For each of the routes defined in the GTFS file, we searched for the coordinates of the smallest possible rectangular bounding box which would enclose all routes of that city. We then cropped the geographical data to the bounding box, using the <italic>OSMConvert</italic> program (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">marqqs, 2022</xref>). This would extract only the appropriate section of the data for our study, greatly reducing simulation overhead. This geographical data was then converted to a simulation-ready road network using the <italic>Netconvert</italic> program (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0485">The software searched this road network to find the exact <italic>path</italic> (sequence of roads) that the simulated taxi must follow to go from one stop to the next. The location of these stops was extracted from the GTFS file (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Andrade et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). The times and sequences of the stops were also extracted and combined with the paths generated to create <italic>route plans</italic>, files which direct the movement of the electric vehicle model during the simulation.</p><p id="p0490">The Dijkstra algorithm was used for solving the paths (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). This algorithm chooses between various optimization objectives when solving for a path: time, distance, energy usage, etc. We chose to use distance, as it is the computationally cheapest optimization (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 2020</xref>). However, for more realistic paths, the <italic>time</italic> objective should be used instead. With the <italic>distance</italic> objective, the algorithm might choose short paths that go along roads with low speed limits and possible congestion. For example, it might choose a path through the city rather than along the highway. With the <italic>time</italic> objective, the algorithm might choose the highway option, which is longer in distance but shorter in time. This would be more realistic because the taxi driver would prefer the quicker option.</p><p id="p0495">For each route, the route plan was generated by traversing through the route&#x02019;s sequence of stops. For each stop, the nearest road on the road network from the stop&#x02019;s coordinates was found, and the shortest path from the road of the previous stop to the current road is calculated. This path is appended to the route plan being built. The route plan also specifies that the simulated vehicle should stop on the current road until the departure time of the current stop.

The model would need to be configurable and use the route&#x02019;s distance, road inclination and curvature to evaluate the electric vehicle&#x02019;s energy usage.</p><p id="p0505">The SUMO software (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>) was used for this purpose. The electric vehicle model built into SUMO allows the user to set various parameters. Although the focus of this study is minibus taxis, a common minibus taxi, namely the Toyota Quantum, was used as a basis for the EV parameters. The following model parameters were chosen from the Quantum&#x02019;s geometry:</p><p id="p0510">Height: 2.3m, width: 1.9m, front-facing surface area: 4 <inline-formula><mml:math id="M7" altimg="si5.gif"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, weight: 2900&#x000a0;kg.</p><p id="p0515">We approximated the rest of the parameters according to the recommendations by <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Fridlund and Wilen (2020)</xref>. These include: Constant power intake: 100W, propulsion efficiency: 0.8, recuperation efficiency: 0.5, roll drag coefficient: 0.01 and radial drag coefficient: 0.5.</p><p id="p0520">The software initialized the EV model for each route that was defined in the GTFS file. The EVs followed the route plans, obeying all speed limits, traffic signals, etc. as defined in the road network. For every second of simulation time, the simulator generated the energy consumption and speed of the EV as it progressed along its route.</p><p id="p0525">The simulation resulted in energy and power usage profiles of the vehicle for each of the routes. The GTFS file defines a <italic>frequencies.txt</italic> file. This file indicates the frequency at which new trips commence on each route, for various periods of the day. For example, a new trip may commence on a particular route every 30&#x000a0;min from 6 AM to 8 AM, and every 10&#x000a0;minutes from 8 AM to 9 AM. Based on this frequency data, the results were replicated for the trips on each of the routes.</p><p id="p0530">With an average of 45,000 daily minibus taxi trips per city, the volume of output data from the simulation was substantial. Our goal was to obtain useful metrics that would summarize this data. The first metric we considered was the total power usage profile of the whole electric minibus paratransit system. Such a profile would indicate how much power the system would require at various times of the day. This profile would be indispensable, for example, for estimating the expected peak load times and the aggregate daily energy needs of the electric fleet on the grid.</p><p id="p0535">We calculated this profile as follows: First we retrieved the power-vs-time results of each trip, to generate&#x000a0;power profiles of each trip. For each route, we aggregated power profiles of the trips done on that route, to get the total power profile of the route. Finally, we aggregated the power profiles of all routes in the taxi system, to get the total power profile of the city&#x02019;s taxis. The profile was plotted with respect to time.</p><p id="p0540">In addition to the power usage characteristics, the energy usage of the minibus taxi system was also of interest. The power profiles obtained in the previous step were integrated with respect to time, to obtain energy-vs-time profiles. The net energy profile of the minibus taxi system of each city would give an estimate of the total daily energy usage, how much energy was saved because of regenerative braking, and how much energy would be used between times of relative inactivity.</p><p id="p0545">Finally, for each city, boxplots were created to show the median energy usage of the routes, as well as the spread of energy usage across the various routes of the city.</p><p id="p0550">In order to verify the results, we generated a table of the characteristics of paratransit in the various cities. The simulation results were compared to these characteristics to see if they corresponded. We chose characteristics of the city that would indicate the magnitude of its transport needs. The following metrics were chosen for this purpose:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0040"><list-item id="u0110"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0555">Number of taxis: A higher number of taxis would indicate that there are probably more trips to be serviced, and hence more energy would be required.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0115"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0560">Number of inhabitants: A city with more inhabitants would have higher transport needs, and, hence, more energy usage could be expected.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0120"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0565">Modal split of minibus taxi in paratransit: If a higher percentage of trips are taken via minibus taxis, as opposed to other modes, the energy usage would be higher.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0570">After further investigation, we found that some of the cities did not have reliable, up-to-date statistics on the number of taxis. We therefore used the remaining two metrics to classify the expected energy demand as high, medium or low. If the product of the population size and the modal split was below a threshold of 1.5 million, we classified the expected energy demand as low. If it was below 2.5 million it was classified as medium, and if was above 2.5 million it was classified as high.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abane</surname><given-names>A.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Travel behaviour in Ghana: empirical observations from four metropolitan areas</article-title><source>J.&#x000a0;Transport Geogr.</source><volume>19</volume><year>2011</year><fpage>313</fpage><lpage>322</lpage><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692310000347?casa_token=83Ql-exFglMAAAAA:4DPySIPY3i2OGVA1f1vciAJ_EockuCqouKLMLbroyc03H4kqQaaFB3r7MQk90LB0g_cxeF09ol0" id="intref0045">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692310000347?casa_token=83Ql-exFglMAAAAA:4DPySIPY3i2OGVA1f1vciAJ_EockuCqouKLMLbroyc03H4kqQaaFB3r7MQk90LB0g_cxeF09ol0</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib51"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref51"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abraham</surname><given-names>C.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rix</surname><given-names>A.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ndibatya</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Booysen</surname><given-names>M.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ray of hope for sub-Saharan Africa's paratransit: Solar charging of urban electric minibus taxis in South Africa, Energy Sustain</article-title><source>Dev.</source><volume>64</volume><year>2021</year><fpage>118</fpage><lpage>127</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.esd.2021.08.003</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adol&#x000e9;houm&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonnafous</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Urban transport microenterprises in abidjan</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/9805/28537findeng186.pdf?sequence=1" id="intref0050">https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/9805/28537findeng186.pdf?sequence=1</ext-link><year>2001</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akpa</surname><given-names>N.E.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Booysen</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sinclair</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Publicly available annotated dataset of tracked taxis</article-title><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/eputs/data/fcd-stellenbosch" id="intref0055">https://gitlab.com/eputs/data/fcd-stellenbosch</ext-link><year>2016</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Andrade</surname><given-names>P.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>R.H.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vieira</surname><given-names>J.P.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>dhersz, Saraiva</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>ipeagit/gtfs2gps: v1.5-4</article-title><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5281/zenodo.5501855</pub-id><year>2021</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref5"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Behrens</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>McCormick</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mfinanga</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></person-group><part-title>Paratransit in African Cities: Operations, Regulation and Reform</part-title><edition>First edition</edition><year>2016</year><publisher-name>Routledge</publisher-name><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.4324/9781315849515</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref6"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Booysen</surname><given-names>M.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Abraham</surname><given-names>C.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rix</surname><given-names>A.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Giliomee</surname><given-names>J.H.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Electrification of minibus taxis in the shadow of load shedding and energy scarcity</article-title><source>S.&#x000a0;Afr.

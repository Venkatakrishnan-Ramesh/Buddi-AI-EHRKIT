It is not known how MSCs regulate local immune responses and liver regeneration. This study explored the effects of MSCs on hepatic macrophages and the Wnt signaling pathway in ALF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>MSCs were isolated from BM aspirates of C57BL/6J mice, and transplanted in mice with ALF induced by D-galactosamine (D-Gal). The proliferation of hepatocytes was assayed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The levels of key proteins in the Wnt signaling pathway were assayed by western blotting and cytokines were determined enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). A macrophage polarization assay characterized the M1/M2 ratio. The potential role of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the biological activity of MSCs was determined by silencing of IL-4.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Transplantation of allogeneic MSCs significantly attenuated D-Gal-induced hepatic inflammation and promoted liver regeneration. MSC transplantation significantly promoted a phenotypic switch from proinflamatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, leading to significant Wnt-3a induction and activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in mice with D-Gal-induced ALF. Of the paracrine factors secreted by MSCs (G-CSF, IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-4, and IL-17A), IL-4 was specifically induced following transplantation in the ALF model mice. The silencing of IL-4 significantly abrogated the phenotypic switch to M2 macrophages and the protective effects of MSCs in both the ALF model mice and a co-culture model in an IL-4 dependent manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showed that MSCs ameliorated ALF through an IL-4-dependent macrophage switch toward the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. The findings may have clinical implications in that overexpression of IL-4 may enhance the therapeutic effects of allogeneic MSC transplantation in the treatment of ALF.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p>

MSC transplantation is an alternative treatment for ALF, but the therapeutic mechanisms need to be elucidated. The major novel findings of this study are: (1) MSC transplantation significantly ameliorated D-Gal-induced inflammation and stimulated liver regeneration (2) and induced a switch of hepatic macrophages from the M1 to the M2 phenotype. (3) Secretion of the paracrine factors IL-4 was specifically induced in following MSC transplantation compared with PBS control mice (4) Knockdown of IL-4 significantly abrogated the switch to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages and attenuation of D-Gal-induced ALF. (5) Silencing of IL-4 in <italic>in vitro</italic> co-cultures of MSCs and hepatic macrophages showed that MSCs promoted the switch to M2 macrophages in an IL-4 dependent manner. The findings indicated that MSCs ameliorated ALF through IL-4-dependent macrophage switch toward M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. These results are consistent with mediation of the protective effects of MSCs by increased levels of hepatic Wnt-3a, which in turn inhibited phosphorylation of &#x003b2;-catenin. The resulting increase of non-phospho-&#x003b2;-catenin (active &#x003b2;-catenin) led to upregulation of HGF, c-myc, and cyclin D1, which promoted liver regeneration. The macrophage phenotype switch can account for the increase of Wnt-3a that was associated with MSC transplantation. Allogeneic MSC transplantation has great therapeutic potential and may be used in clinical practice in the future.</p><p>It has been reported that transplantation of autologous MSCs can prevent liver injury caused by D-Gal in animal models.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The transplantation of autologous MSCs to treatment patients with severe ALF is not feasible because the severity of the condition makes it challenging to obtain autologous MSCs that meet quality and quantity standards. That is the reason we used allogeneic MSCs in this study. We transplanted BM-derived MSCs into recipient mice of the same species with different genes. The results showed that allogeneic MSCs transplantation achieved protective effects in mice with D-Gal-induced ALF.</p><p>We found that most transplanted MSCs homed to D-Gal-injured liver tissue. Twenty-four hours after intracavitary injection, MSCs were detected in the liver, but not in any other organs. Amiri F. <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> found that MSCs migrated to the liver within 24 h after blood transfusion, and were able to reducing liver failure. However, several other studies have reported that MSCs were mainly found in the lungs, after administration, and not in the liver.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Lee KC <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> also found that most MSCs were retained in the lungs, but reduced hepatocyte apoptosis. The inconsistency may be related to different injection methods. MSCs infused through the portal vein flow into the liver first, while MSCs given by tail vein infusion flow into the lungs first. Most of the injected MSCs remain in the liver or lungs in the form of emboli. Although no MSCs were detected in the liver after intravenous injection, hepatitis was still remarkably attenuated in animal models. In this study, BM-derived MSCs had a beneficial effect on ALF. MSCs transplanted into the liver reduced the inflammatory reaction and the liver injury by promoting a phenotypic switch to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, and the involvement of Wnt-3a, was supported by the finding that Wnt-c59, a Wnt-3a inhibitor, blocked the hepatoprotective effect of MSCs. The results indicate that Wnt-3a was involve in the liver protection of MSCs, especially in the regulation of macrophage polarization. In this study, it was found that the increase in Wnt-3a caused by MSCs promoted the recovery of liver injury by activating the Wnt signaling pathway, leading to upregulation of non-phospho-&#x003b2;-catenin expression.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> It is well known that activation of the &#x003b2;-catenin pathway is indispensable for the repair of liver damage, and that &#x003b2;-catenin is a key protein in the regulation of the expression of cyclins A, D and E. Cyclins regulate the progression of cells from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It has been found that within 24 h of D-Gal induced liver injury, the expression of nuclear and cytoplasmic &#x003b2;-catenin significantly increased in some hepatocytes. Elevated &#x003b2;-catenin could be the basis of liver lobule repair and promotion of liver regeneration. In this study, the increased expression of &#x003b2;-catenin was accompanied by increased expression of the HGF, c-myc and cyclin-D1. Consistent with previous studies, we found that the induction of &#x003b2;-catenin expression occurred before that of its target genes.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Wnt-3a regulates the activation of various immune cells, such as macrophage phenotype transformation, and activation of regulatory T cell subsets and helper T cells. We found that the expression of Foxp3 was not changed, and that the number of CD4 T cells was significantly reduced. Therefore, the activation of Wnt-3a induced by MSC transplantation was closely related to macrophages. Moreover, Wnt-3a from macrophages rather than T cells has been shown to inhibit acute inflammation, which further supports our findings.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Ylostalo <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> found that MSCs induced macrophage M2 polarization mainly through the COX2-dependent prostaglandin E2 pathway. In contrast to Ylostalo <italic>et al</italic>.,<xref rid="JCTH-D-21-00127-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> we observed a significant increase in the expression of IL4 but not COX2 following MSC transplantation. In addition, the therapeutic effect of BM-derived MSCs was abrogated by IL-4 gene knockout, indicating that the IL4 gene was essential for the immunomodulatory activity of MSCs.</p><p>It merits attention that in our study, BM-derived MSC promoted a switch in macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2 by increasing Wnt-3a. The underlying mechanism involved production and secretion of IL-4 by BM-derived MSCs in the host inflammatory state, stimulated the reprogramming of the host liver macrophages, and increased the expression of Wnt-3a, which inhibited the liver inflammatory response and reduced liver injury.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that transplantation of allogeneic MSCs ameliorated ALF induced by D-Gal through an IL-4-dependent macrophage switch toward the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. Our findings may have clinical implications in that upregulation of IL-4 may enhance the therapeutic effects of allogeneic MSC transplantation in the treatment of ALF.</p></sec><sec

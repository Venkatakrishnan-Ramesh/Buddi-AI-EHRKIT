Previous studies have determined an average duration of approximately 10&#x000a0;weeks for inhibition of intraocular VEGF in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treated with intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL), thus supporting durable VEGF inhibition in most patients treated with IVT-AFL every 8&#x000a0;weeks, as per prescribing recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, post hoc analyses of the pivotal IVT-AFL VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 trials and clinical experience have suggested that some patients may benefit from IVT-AFL treatment administered more frequently than every 8&#x000a0;weeks, given that approximately 20% of eyes initially treated with IVT-AFL had early persistent fluid present after three initial monthly doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In the VIEW studies, IVT-AFL was administered in a fixed dosing regimen in Year 1 and capped pro re nata (PRN) dosing was used in year 2; however, proactive, individualized treat-and-extend (T&#x00026;E) regimens with anti-VEGF agents, such as IVT-AFL and ranibizumab, are becoming increasingly popular for the management of nAMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Regardless of the treatment regimen used, effective inhibition of VEGF is key to optimizing treatment outcomes in patients with nAMD. Although the principle of a T&#x00026;E regimen is to extend treatment intervals while maintaining best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) outcomes, an advantage of such a flexible regimen is that it permits the shortening of treatment intervals, when necessary, to maintain outcomes.</p><p id="Par8">The recent 2-year ARIES study was, to our best knowledge, the first randomized clinical trial of IVT-AFL administered using a T&#x00026;E regimen that allowed the requirement for injection-intensive treatment (treatment intervals&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks) to be evaluated during the first 2&#x000a0;years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. ARIES demonstrated similar clinical outcomes between treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with nAMD treated with an IVT-AFL early start (from week 16) or late start (from week 48) IVT-AFL T&#x00026;E regimen following initial dosing. Approximately half of patients achieved a last treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;weeks at Week 104. The study protocol stipulated that treatment intervals should not be&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks unless patients were considered by the investigator to require injections more frequently. If the study investigator identified the need for a treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks at least once after randomization into the trial, and if the patients had at least one treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks, the patients were considered to be injection-intensive and continued in the study, although they were excluded from the per-protocol analyses. Injection-intensive patients could be extended again to longer treatment intervals, based on investigator judgment and, in that respect, the regimen is reflective of routine clinical practice and clinical guidelines for IVT-AFL T&#x00026;E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">It is important that the outcomes of such injection-intensive patients with nAMD are better understood, and to recognize what proportion of patients could benefit from more frequent IVT-AFL dosing than every 8&#x000a0;weeks during the first year of treatment. This post hoc analysis of the ARIES study explores the requirement, as per investigator decision, for IVT-AFL to be administered more frequently than every 8&#x000a0;weeks, at least once during the ARIES study duration. The frequency, point in time, and reasons for an IVT-AFL treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks were evaluated, and BCVA (vision) and CRT (anatomic) outcomes in such injection-intensive patients with nAMD were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The ARIES Study</title><p id="Par10">ARIES (NCT02581891) was a multicenter, randomized, phase 3b/4 study that compared the efficacy of two different IVT-AFL T&#x00026;E dosing regimens over 2&#x000a0;years in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with nAMD, published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Briefly, patients received 2&#x000a0;mg IVT-AFL at Week 0, Week 4, Week 8, and Week&#x000a0;16. At Week 16, patients were stratified based on BCVA outcomes (&#x0003c;&#x02009;8 or&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;8 letters gained in BCVA) and randomized 1:1 to early-start T&#x00026;E or late-start T&#x00026;E arms. Treatment intervals were extended by 2&#x000a0;weeks each time, up to a maximum of 16&#x000a0;weeks if the criteria were met.

The FAS was defined as all randomized patients who received IVT-AFL and had a BCVA assessment at Week 16 and at least one additional post-Week 16 BCVA assessment; both treatment arms were combined. Patients were determined by the study investigator to be injection-intensive (injection-intensive determination) if they identified the need for a treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks at least once after randomization into the trial, and if the patients had at least one treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks, even if they were subsequently extended beyond 8-week treatment intervals. The first visit when a patient was determined as injection-intensive is subsequently described as &#x0201c;the injection-intensive visit.&#x0201d;</p><p id="Par13">The injection-intensive visit (a treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;49&#x000a0;days since the previous injection) could occur at any time from randomization (Week 16) to Week 104. The first shortened interval could be 4&#x000a0;weeks (21&#x02013;35&#x000a0;days) or 6&#x000a0;weeks (36&#x02013;48&#x000a0;days), with patients categorized as receiving an 8-week interval if treatment was given after 49&#x02013;63&#x000a0;days. Treatment intervals were not permitted to drop below 4&#x000a0;weeks. In the early-start T&#x00026;E arm, patients with an injection-intensive visit could be subsequently returned to a T&#x00026;E regimen with treatment intervals of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks, where appropriate, following an injection-intensive interval in Year 1. In the late-start T&#x00026;E arm, patients with an injection-intensive visit could be subsequently extended back to 8-week treatment intervals after an injection-intensive interval in Year 1, but treatment intervals could not be extended further until after Week 48. In this analysis, the percentage of injection-intensive patients in Year 1 and 2 was evaluated, as well as the timing of the injection-intensive requirement; BCVA and CRT outcomes were also evaluated in injection-intensive patients, including the proportion of patients with visual gains and losses at end of study (Week 104) overall and per baseline BCVA subgroup level (high,&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;70 letters; intermediate, 55&#x02013;69 letters; low,&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;55 letters).

Our first observation was that 23% of treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with nAMD required IVT-AFL more frequently than every 8&#x000a0;weeks at some point during treatment; there was a relatively linear relationship between duration of IVT-AFL and the proportion of patients requiring an injection-intensive interval, indicating that this need may arise at any point during the first 2&#x000a0;years of treatment. The larger numbers of patients with such intervals observed at Week 16, Week 20, and Week 24 (as displayed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), are largely driven by the synchronicity of the 8-weekly treatment intervals in the late-start T&#x00026;E arm in Year 1. Secondly, although 23% of patients were determined to be injection-intensive at some point over the 2&#x000a0;years of the ARIES study, more than half (60%) achieved at least one treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks, after their injection-intensive visit, and two patients achieved a maximum treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;16&#x000a0;weeks. Finally, improvements in both BCVA and CRT outcomes were observed at the end of study, both from the injection-intensive visit and from baseline, indicating that an injection-intensive episode does not imply that such patients are necessarily poor responders; in fact, more than half of the injection-intensive patients gained at least five letters by the end of the study, while BCVA remained stable in another 26% of patients.</p><p id="Par23">The results demonstrate that baseline visual acuity does not provide an indication of whether patients will be more or less likely to respond to treatment (see Fig. S1). In fact, the results suggest that the requirement for an injection-intensive interval cannot be predicted from patient baseline characteristics, as there were no key differences between injection-intensive and non&#x02013;injection-intensive groups. A difference was observed in the length of the longest treatment interval following the injection-intensive visit between patients who were determined to be injection-intensive in the first and second years of treatment. Patients determined as injection-intensive in the first year achieved longer treatment intervals following the injection-intensive visit, a fact that is likely due, at least in part, to the insufficient time before the final study visit at Week 104 to extend treatment intervals after an injection-intensive visit occurring later in the course of the study.</p><p id="Par24">Notably, the determination of injection-intensive status (i.e., if the study investigator identified a need for, and the patient had, a treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;49&#x000a0;days since the previous visit) used in this analysis is likely to be different, and more conservative, compared with how anti-VEGF treatment would be considered intensive in routine clinical practice. Over a 2-year treatment period, the need for more intensive treatment would be more likely to be considered clinically relevant if patients required at least 2 consecutive shorter treatment intervals (&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks) and could not subsequently be extended beyond 8-week treatment intervals.</p><p id="Par25">In the VIEW studies, which compared fixed dosing every 4&#x000a0;weeks (q4w) and every 8&#x000a0;weeks in Year 1, both IVT-AFL treatment regimens were considered to be equivalent to ranibizumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg q4w and additional efficacy with more frequent dosing was not demonstrated in most patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. By the end of Week 96 in VIEW (capped PRN), 2&#x02013;4% of patients required all injections on a monthly basis, and a third of patients required at least one injection with a treatment interval of only one&#x000a0;month. As previously noted, post hoc analysis of the VIEW trials and clinical experience have suggested that some patients may benefit from dosing of IVT-AFL more frequently than every 8&#x000a0;weeks, given that approximately 20% of eyes initially treated with IVT-AFL had early persistent fluid present after the three initial monthly doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There are some regional variations in IVT-AFL prescribing recommendations for nAMD based on these data, with those in the USA, Canada, and Australia acknowledging that some patients may require every-4-week (monthly) dosing after the first 12&#x000a0;weeks (3&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Europe, IVT-AFL prescribing recommendations have been recently revised based on the data presented here, to recognize that treatment intervals shorter than every 8&#x000a0;weeks may be needed in some patients during the course of nAMD management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In contrast, prescribing recommendations in some Latin American countries (e.g., Argentina, Colombia), and some Asian countries (e.g., China, South Korea) currently have a recommendation of dosing every 8&#x000a0;weeks or more.</p><p id="Par26">The duration of intraocular VEGF inhibition achieved with IVT-AFL treatment varies in patients with nAMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; therefore, there is a clear need for a truly individualized treatment regimen, where treatment intervals can be adjusted upwards and downwards to optimize VEGF inhibition and preserve vision outcomes. The ARIES and ALTAIR studies, which both compared different T&#x00026;E approaches, supported the efficacy and safety of IVT-AFL treatment in a T&#x00026;E regimen as an alternative to fixed dosing in the first year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The ALTAIR study was conducted in Japanese patients with treatment-na&#x000ef;ve nAMD, and demonstrated similar outcomes to those achieved in the VIEW studies; in ALTAIR, three initial monthly IVT-AFL injections were administered, followed by one injection after a further 2&#x000a0;months, and subsequently the adoption of a T&#x00026;E regimen with treatment intervals altered in 2- or 4-week increments up to a maximum treatment interval of 16&#x000a0;weeks (according to prespecified criteria). The injection-intensive requirement could not be investigated in ALTAIR, as the protocol stipulated that the minimum treatment interval must not be&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks during the entire study period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This ARIES post hoc analysis further substantiates the benefits of a proactive, individualized T&#x00026;E regimen, as it means that injection-intensive patients can be identified, and treatment tailored to the needs of each patient throughout the course of their disease management. As an alternative to decreasing treatment intervals to optimize outcomes, the principle of increasing the administered dose to 8&#x000a0;mg has been investigated in the phase 2 CANDELA study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with results of phase 3 studies expected to be reported later this year.</p><p id="Par27">We must acknowledge that this was a post hoc analysis, and the ARIES study was not designed to compare outcomes in injection-intensive and non&#x02013;injection-intensive populations. Additionally, as discussed above, the protocol-specified definition of treatment intensiveness (requirement of one treatment interval of&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks only) is rather conservative compared to what might be considered intensive in the clinical setting, where a single treatment interval&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;weeks can also be needed for logistical reasons. It should also be noted that the determination of injection-intensive status used in the ARIES study was not based on a predefined set of criteria but left at the discretion of the investigator, which aligns with routine clinical practice. Furthermore, some apparent observations, specifically the shorter treatment intervals subsequently achieved in patients determined to require injection-intensive treatment in Year 2, are impacted by when the injection-intensive visit occurred, as there is a shorter timeframe for these patients to extend their treatment intervals again before the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par28">This post hoc analysis is the first known analysis to evaluate injection-intensive patients within an IVT-AFL T&#x00026;E clinical trial setting. The results suggest that, at times, IVT-AFL treatment more frequent than every 8&#x000a0;weeks may be deemed necessary for some patients with active nAMD. However, this does not restrict a patient&#x02019;s potential to subsequently extend treatment intervals, as the requirement for injection-intensive treatment intervals is transient for the majority of patients. Thus, injection-intensive treatment intervals may be included as part of a proactive, individualized T&#x00026;E IVT-AFL regimen when treating patients with nAMD in routine clinical practice to enable them to achieve improved vision and anatomic outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec12"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40123_2022_541_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PDF 152 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par29">The ARIES study was sponsored by Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany.

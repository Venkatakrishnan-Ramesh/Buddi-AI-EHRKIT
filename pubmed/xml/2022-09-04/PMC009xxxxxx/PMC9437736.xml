The mechanism for this is unclear. We hypothesise that innate sex differences, rather than comorbidity burden, drive higher male mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>Retrospective cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Montefiore Health System (MHS) in Bronx, New York, USA.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A cohort population of 364&#x02009;992 patients at MHS between 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2020 was defined, from which individuals hospitalised during the pre-COVID period (1 January 2020&#x02013;15 February 2020) (n=5856) and individuals hospitalised during the COVID-19 surge (1 March 2020&#x02013;15 April 2020) (n=4793) were examined for outcomes.

Unadjusted logistic regression showed a higher odds of death in hospitalised men than women during both the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (pre-COVID-19, OR: 1.66 vs COVID-19 OR: 1.98). After adjustment for relevant clinical and demographic factors, the higher risk of male death attenuated towards the null in the pre-COVID-19 period (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.76) but remained significantly higher in the COVID-19 period (OR 2.02; 95%&#x02009;CI 1.73 to 2.34).</p><p>In the subcohort of COVID-19+ hospitalised patients, men had 1.37 higher odds of in-hospital death (95%&#x02009;CI 1.09 to 1.72), which was not altered by adjustment for comorbidity (OR remained at 1.38 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.76)) but was attenuated with addition of initial pulse oximetry on presentation (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.62).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Higher male mortality risk during the COVID-19 period despite adjustment for comorbidity supports the role of innate physiological susceptibility to COVID-19 death. Attenuation of higher male risk towards the null after adjustment for severity of lung disease in hospitalised COVID-19+ patients further supports the role of higher severity of COVID-19 pneumonia in men.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>public health</kwd><kwd>public health</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>respiratory infections</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>access-type</meta-name><meta-value>free</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float"><caption><title>STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Using Looking Glass, we built a database of patients (n=364&#x02009;992) who received outpatient care between 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2020 and was defined as the denominator patient population.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Those patient with hospitalisations and in-hospital deaths during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods were examined as a proportion of the denominator population allowing for a robust assessment of risk.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To elucidate the role of baseline comorbidity in higher risk of COVID-19 mortality in men, we used mixed-effects logistic regression to examine the association between sex and hospitalisation/death (outcomes) with and without adjustment for patient comorbidity.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The analysis did not include outpatient deaths which limited the scalability of the findings and introduced sampling bias.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Numerous studies have shown that men have a higher risk of COVID-19-related death as compared with women.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;14</xref> Men also have a more severe disease course, with higher odds of in-hospital adverse outcomes such as ICU admission, need for ventilatory support, and higher odds of acute kidney and cardiac injury.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Mediators of the risk difference between the sexes have been attributed to differences in comorbidities, risk behaviours (such as smoking and not seeking preventive healthcare), exposure rate (more men work in occupations that force them to leave their homes and have contact with other people) and biological differences in susceptibility.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 8</xref> For example, preliminary data from Gebhard <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> describe an association between comorbidities, risk behaviours (ie, smoking) and COVID-19 disease severity.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Another study from a cohort of patients in Bronx, New York, showed that obesity, male sex and older age were associated with greater in-hospital mortality.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Other researchers argue that inherent biological differences in ACE expression, androgen-mediated regulation of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), as well as sex differences in immune responses, are the actual mediators.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 7&#x02013;9 16 17</xref></p><p>To address the question of what is mediating the higher male risk for COVID-19-related mortality, cohort studies should adjust for comorbidity and viral exposure to test the strength of association between male sex and COVID-19 outcome, with the understanding that a demonstration of the attenuation of this strength supports the role of these explanatory variables in imparting higher male risk. In this study, we first establish the disproportionate higher risk of in-hospital male death in one large health system in the Bronx during a period impacted by the COVID-19 surge of 2020 as compared with a pre-COVID time period. Because of the comprehensive nature of our clinical database and because this was still a period where vaccinations were not available, we are uniquely able to evaluate the role of comorbidity and smoking behaviour as an explanation for the higher risk of in-hospital COVID-19-related death in men. We then examine the role of severity of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia as a plausible explanation for any higher male risk found in a subcohort of patients hospitalised with confirmed COVID-19 illness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>To test the association of sex with COVID-19-related outcomes, we: (1) test the relative risk of male hospitalisation and in-hospital mortality, as compared with female, during the initial COVID-19 surge of New York (1 March 2020&#x02013;15 April 2020) and compare this risk to a pre-COVID-19 time period (1 January 2020&#x02013;15 February 2020)<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; (2) then compare the odds of male versus female death in a subset of patients hospitalised with a confirmed positive COVID-19 test during the COVID-19 surge time period and (3) provide a descriptive analysis of the city/state and national level impact of COVID-19 death by sex using Vital Statistics/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref></p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study populations</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To minimise sampling bias, a baseline population of 364&#x02009;992 Bronx addressed adult patients (&#x0003e;18 years) receiving care at Bronx Montefiore Health System (BMHS) between 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2020 was defined.

The higher male risk for hospitalisation was driven by higher comorbidity in the pre-COVID-19 period but not during the COVID-19 period. Men were also at disproportionately higher risk of death during both time periods, and even though their greater risk of death attenuated towards the null in the pre-COVID-19 time period with adjustment for relevant comorbidities it remained significantly elevated compared with females during the COVID-19 period. These data show that the higher comorbidity burden and higher prevalence of smoking among males does not explain the higher risk of COVID-19-related mortality in men. Thus, even though comorbidity at least partially explains the higher male risk for death in the general population, it fails to do so during the COVID-19 surge of 2020. This suggests the unique vulnerability of men to the virus. In our subgroup analysis of those hospitalised patients with an established positive COVID-19 test, we showed that the higher risk of male death was attenuated towards the null only when adjusting for pulseoximetry readings on hospitalisation, suggesting that men were more critically ill with COVID-19 pneumonia than women and this may have been an explanation for their higher death rate.</p><p>Using city-wide data from the department of health, and state-wide and national data from the CDC, a higher risk of male COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths was also observed.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref> The greater ARDS and respiratory failure rates in males were attributed to a dysregulated immune response in other studies.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, the higher male risk for mortality may be related to sexual dimorphism in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and regulation.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 16 29</xref> To enter a host cell, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 surface receptor via its spike protein. Androgen mediated upregulation of TMPRSS2 has been hypothesised to contribute to increased male disease severity with COVID-19.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9 16</xref> In fact, men on androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer have a significant reduction in COVID-19 infection compared with men with prostate cancer not on this therapy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Sex-based differences in immune responses have been theorised as another explanation for the increased male mortality with COVID-19. Sex hormones and the X chromosome (which encodes for various immune regulatory genes) have a significant influence on the immune response.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Kelada <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> report that female sex hormones are immunostimulatory.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Oestrogen contributes to B cell development and induces production of cytokines in response to viral entry while facilitating reduction of viral load.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> High levels of oestrogen and progesterone in females have been shown to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and stimulate cell-mediated immunity and antibody production all of which contribute to faster viral clearance.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> When hormone replacement therapy was given to postmenopausal women, a decreased mortality from COVID-19 was observed.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Animal studies demonstrated greater disease severity in female mice after a ovariectomy or administration of an oestrogen receptor antagonist.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> These findings suggest a protective effect of female sex that is not explained by comorbidities.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Sex differences in vaccine responses have also been demonstrated, with women mounting stronger responses.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> However, our data predate COVID-19 vaccines so that vaccine responsiveness and or vaccine seeking behaviours do not contribute to our findings.</p><p>Higher exposure to virus is another potential explanation for the higher male risks observed. Men are more likely to break social distancing rules and less likely to wear masks or perform proper hand hygiene than women.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 5</xref> Also, men smoke more than women which has clear implications on cardiovascular and pulmonary health.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Such differences in health behaviour may be a result of cultural and societal constructs of what &#x02018;masculine&#x02019; behaviour entails.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> To examine the potential role of men&#x02019;s social behaviour in putting them at risk of higher exposure to, and of a higher inoculum dose when exposed, examining outcomes in a controlled environment, such as nursing homes, where male and female residents have similar exposures, may be instructive. Nursing home data show that male residents die at a greater rate than female residents from COVID-19.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;37</xref> Heras <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> reported the mortality rate for COVID-positive nursing home male residents was 42% compared with 12.9% for COVID-19-positive female residents.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Another study from an Italian nursing home found that the male COVID-19 mortality rate was 46%, while for females, it was 41%, a significant difference.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Similar findings were present in another study from multiple US nursing homes, where the male COVID-19 mortality rate was also reported as being higher.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Thus, the role of exposure to virus as an explanation for why men have worse COVID-19 outcomes than women is not compelling.</p><p>Limitations of this study include lack of data on deaths occurring outside of the hospital in the pre COVID-19 and COVID-19 time periods, which would shed light on the role of differential self-referrals to the hospital in the observed outcomes. Furthermore, hospital and population data may provide incomplete documentation of clinical and demographic variables. Unfortunately, New York City&#x02019;s Office of Vital Statistics has not yet completed death data for 2020, which would have provided total death counts in the city by sex. Moreover, our study was an observational analysis and as such any inference is not conclusive. Residual confounding is also a limitation as there are factors that we did not adjust for (eg, environmental factors). Although our database lacked data on male vs female exposures to the virus, we have used the nursing home data in the previous paragraph to illustrate how exposure rates are playing a lesser role than once thought. Lastly, our data may not apply to the current wave of the pandemic. A review of the literature found that reduction in death with newer variants of the COVID-19 virus, and with the protective effects of vaccination and boosters seemed to favour men more than women. Notwithstanding the enhanced mortality benefit of late among men, they remained at higher risk of mortality than women in most reports.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref></p><p>In conclusion, we showed that comorbidity burden and risk behaviours (smoking) are not the main drivers of the higher risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes in men, but severity of COVID-19 related pneumonia is likely a significant driver. Future studies should look more closely at sex-based differences in physiologic, hormonal and immune mediators in response to COVID-19 infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e146"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2022-063862.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e147"><caption><title>Author's

Most commonly it occurs as a complication of neurosurgery, but also after head injury [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Ventriculitis typically occurs in association with medical devices, such as external-ventricular drains (EVD) or ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VP shunts). EVDs are used for short-term regulation and monitoring of intracranial pressure, for the administration of certain medications and the collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. VP shunts are used for long term regulation of intracranial pressure, particularly in patients with hydrocephalus. Ventriculitis is difficult to define as the clinical presentation varies depending on the causative organism and the clinical scenario. A combination of symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging findings and clinical judgement are used to make a diagnosis [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The epidemiology of ventriculitis varies between location and the type of neurological device used, with some studies demonstrating a 20% incidence rate [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) has a busy neurosurgical unit, and is estimated to carry out over 3000 neurosurgical procedures per year [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Currently, the local epidemiology of ventriculitis has not been investigated previously.</p><p id="p0015">The management of ventriculitis can be lengthy and expensive and ventriculitis can lead to serious long-term sequelae and even result in death. [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Device-associated ventriculitis is complicated by biofilm formation on the devices with organisms becoming phenotypically resistant to antimicrobials while remaining sensitive in their planktonic form [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Studies show that coagulase-negative staphylococci and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are the most frequent causes of ventriculitis but multi-drug resistant Gram-negative organisms are increasingly becoming important [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">The treatment of ventriculitis at UHCW utilises a multidisciplinary team approach as recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and local trust guidelines [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Treatment relies on removal of infected device and broad-spectrum antimicrobials which should be modified according to culture results. Antimicrobial treatment is generally given for at least 14 days post CSF sterility taking into account the clinical response and causative organism.</p><p id="p0030">Inappropriate antimicrobial use promotes antimicrobial resistance [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], a global threat on a par with climate change [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Good antimicrobial stewardship requires that the antimicrobial choice is evidence-based [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Ventriculitis, as a healthcare-associated infection is likely to be caused by multi-drug resistant organisms and thus poses a challenge for treatment [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. Furthermore, the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials in these cases causes harm to the patient's gut microbiome.

The aim of this study was twofold. Firstly, to compare the management of ventriculitis cases at UHCW with IDSA and UHCW treatment guidelines and to identify areas for improvement in treatment of ventriculitis at UHCW. Secondly, to document the epidemiology of microbiologically proven ventriculitis in UHCW. This information will be used to revise the ventriculitis empirical antimicrobial treatment guidelines at UHCW.</p><p id="p0040">To the best of our knowledge there has been no published study carried out on the treatment of all microbiologically proven cases of ventriculitis, although audits of EVD-related infections have been conducted [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="p0045">Ethical approval for the study was obtained from Warwick Medical School (BSREC Number- BSREC- CDA- SSC2-2019-33).</p><p id="p0050">To identify microbiologically proven ventriculitis, a search of the microbiological database at UHCW for the period 2009 to 2019 was conducted according to the criteria in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;I</xref> and further searches were carried out in UHCW's clinical result reporting system (CRRS) according to criteria and methodology in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;II</xref>.

IDSA guidelines include some antimicrobials which were not available at UHCW such as oxacillin, and therefore this table reflects feasible antimicrobial choice based on the local formulary. Each patient's treatment was compared to both UHCW and IDSA guidelines using this tool. For antimicrobial use that deviated from the guidelines, the CRRS was reviewed for allergy to antimicrobials and the antimicrobial sensitivities. Duration of treatment was calculated by taking the day of culture negative CSF to the day when the antimicrobials were stopped. Both sets of guidelines base duration of treatment on the organism isolated. Initially this is based on the Gram stain results until a final identification is obtained. The number of caseswhich met the treatment duration of 14 days for Gram-positive organisms and 21 days for Gram-negative organisms (recommended treatment duration during the study period) was then calculated. Where there was deviation from guidelines for antimicrobial choice or course length, the medical notes were examined for the rationale.

Antimicrobial treatment alone has a low probability of success [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], or high risk of recurrence [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A common feature of device-related infections is adherence and biofilm formation, which are difficult to treat with antimicrobials alone due to the immune evasion and intrinsic tolerance to antimicrobials [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and therefore, antimicrobials alone are not recommended for ventriculitis management. Most cases did have device removal at UCHW but there was significant variation in when devices were removed. The reason for this was difficult to ascertain, owing to variation in documentation. When intracranial devices should be removed is controversial because there is little consensus on timing of removal and the risk of recurrence being higher if devices remain in-situ [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This suggests several different approaches for when devices should be removed, and documentation for a rationale is lacking. According to UHCW policy, documentation should be accessible via the &#x0201c;Theatre&#x0201d; tab of CRRS but for several cases this was either not present or inferred from other sources.</p><p id="p0125">Meropenem is useful for the treatment of ventriculitis, due to good CSF penetration and broad spectrum of activity [<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Empirical meropenem is recommended by the IDSA. Meropenem is only recommended for the treatment Gram-negative organisms and is not for the management of Staphylococci or Enterococcal infections [<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although meropenem is effective for the treatment of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infections which are methicillin-sensitive, it has little or no activity against most other staphylococci [<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, the continued use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials when not required is a concern for antimicrobial stewardship. Treatment with unnecessary or inappropriate antimicrobials increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance development [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and risk of <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has been declared a significant threat by the CDC [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and Public Health England (now UK Health Security Agency) [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The rationalisation of antimicrobial therapy is a vital component of infection management and documentation was lacking in many of the cases examined.</p><p id="p0130">This study also demonstrates the potential financial costs of inappropriate antimicrobial use. For serious and challenging infections such as ventriculitis, it may be understandable to continue empirical antimicrobials despite microbiological evidence. Studies have shown that this is a common, complex and multi-factorial phenomenon [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Further investigation of these factors is outside the scope of this study. Our recommendations to improve antimicrobial use are education and feedback of these results to all members of the multidisciplinary team to promote discussion to identify interventions to improve the antimicrobial treatment of ventriculitis in the future. Such an approach is a cornerstone of antimicrobial stewardship and there is evidence to support its effectiveness [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Further studies are needed to monitor any improvement in the management of ventriculitis in UHCW. The comparative rarity of confirmed ventriculitis in UHCW means that a long period of time is required for enough ventriculitis cases to have occurred to reach significance.</p><p id="p0135">The duration of antimicrobial therapy was highly variable in this study. Although the IDSA guidelines give recommendations for the optimal treatment duration, these are based on evidence from poor quality cohort studies, observational studies and expert opinion. Treatment duration should be based on clinical response and CSF results [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, CSF culture results are directly affected by the administration of antimicrobials prior to CSF sample collection [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and the CSF WCC can vary significantly [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Therefore, due to variations in documentation and poor reliability of using CSF parameters to predict resolution of infection it is difficult to determine the optimum antimicrobial treatment duration. There was poor documentation for the rationale of treatment duration used or why treatment was stopped. The mortality rate seen in this study is representative of rates from other studies [<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>].</p><p id="p0140">Poor documentation affected every aspect of our data collection. Where treatment deviated from guidelines, there was a lack of explanation in documented in paper notes. Poor documentation of aseptic technique of CSF sampling and method of IT antimicrobial administration may have affected the results of this study. Although we are confident our results reflect the reality of treatment of ventriculitis, poor documentation adds a degree of uncertainty. Often, an indication for antimicrobials was not documented and was identified by methods described. What is more, where multiple isolates were identified it was unclear which were considered significant. Furthermore, was difficult to ascertain the decision making which led to deviation from both sets of guidelines due to the retrospective nature of this work and variable thoroughness of documentation. Inadequate documentation for medication changes has been shown by studies in different clinical areas [<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Further research is needed to determine the root cause for the absence of detailed documentation. However, restraint should be exercised before simply recommending more documentation as this alone is unlikely to lead to significant change in patient outcomes because it reduces time for direct patient care [<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Currently, there is a multi-disciplinary approach to the management of ventriculitis, with microbiologist advice but with ultimate clinical responsibility with the neurosurgical team.</p><p id="p0145">The results of isolated organisms are reflected in other studies with staphylococci being the most frequent [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Enterococci were the second most common isolate, which is unusual compared to other studies [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Enterococcal CSF infections are often polymicrobial [<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It is possible that the empirical use of vancomycin may have selected a single enterococcal strain and several vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolates were reported. The recent trend in some centres of increased Gram-negative isolates, especially <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> was not observed in this neurosurgical centre [<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The clinical significance of some of the organisms grown in this study is not clear. Although isolates were excluded if documented as not clinically significant, the retrospective nature of this study means it is likely some organisms included were not clinically significant.</p><p id="p0150">This study has several limitations. The initial search may have excluded some cases. Although ventriculitis should be treated on the neurosurgical ward at UHCW, it is possible some cases may have been treated elsewhere. So-called outliers (patients who are receiving specialist medical or surgical care in locations other than their specialist ward) are frequent, with one study reporting just under 10% of patients receive care as outliers [<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Many patients in this study receiving some care on ICU, so it is possible cases would have been missed if ventriculitis occurred whilst on ICU and the patient died before ICU discharge. It is also possible that excluding CSF samples with organisms classically causing acute meningitis, may have excluded cases of ventriculitis. There are several case reports of ventriculitis caused by such organisms [<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The rarity of such cases is unlikely to have a significant impact on the quality of our findings.</p><p id="p0155">Another potential limitation is the clustering of cases between 2012 and 2014. As the both the IDSA and UHCW guidelines were published in 2017, the evidence guiding the management prior to this may have differed in recommendations. However, many studies published pre-2017 show similar treatment recommendations [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The costing data may also have been affected by this clustering of cases. We used an estimate for treatment regimes in this study and used current pricing for meropenem and linezolid used in cases treated over 10 years. As medication prices vary over time [<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], this value is an estimate only and the true figure will differ. In addition to this, dosing was assumed to be that of normal renal function and no data was collected about patient's renal function. Therefore, this would also overestimate cost if patients had reduced frequency or dose of antimicrobial depending on their renal function [<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, this study only analysed cases at one centre and therefore how relatable these findings are to other sites is difficult to comment on. However, inappropriate antimicrobial use is well-recognised in healthcare.</p><p id="p0160">To the best of our knowledge there are no other published studies on the local management of all cases of confirmed ventriculitis. In addition, the data presented here further supports the importance of antimicrobial stewardship. The data on the causative organisms identified in the study may help support future empirical management of ventriculitis at UHCW.</p><p id="p0165">We suggest that further studies should be conducted about the management of suspected or culture-negative ventriculitis. In addition, research into the root cause of poor documentation observed in this study should be conducted. Future research may also investigate the possible causes for the current trend in decline in cases. One potential cause of this may be improved neurosurgical technique, which several studies have shown to reduce incidence of ventriculitis [<xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0170">This study provides detailed analysis of the management of confirmed ventriculitis cases at UHCW including the pattern of causative organisms.

Early diagnosis of the disease can reduce the risk of pain and complications. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore molecular markers with high specificity and sensitivity for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of STB disease. Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) is a 60kDa molecular protein that belongs to type I reactive proteins and plays an important significant role in infectious diseases or immune responses.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The literature has confirmed that LBP is expressed directly in human peripheral hematogenous monocytes, interacting with human macrophages and monocytes.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Its specific and stable expression in cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases is expected to be the potential for detecting molecular markers of diseases.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> However, the potential capabilities of LBP are not yet clear. In this study, we screened and validated the differential expression of LBP as a molecular marker in the peripheral blood of STB patients and healthy subjects by proteomics and analyzed the correlation of its clinical characteristics to evaluate the potential of LBP as a diagnostic biomarker for STB, hoping to provide reference and ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of STB.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Clinical Data</title><p>From May 2017 to May 2020, the Department of Spine orthopedics of Ningxia Medical University admitted 100 exceptions to the peripheral blood and clinical data of patients with spinal tuberculosis were collected for the experimental group and 30 cases of healthy examinees, of which 50 cases of males and 50 cases of females in the experimental group, aged 18&#x02013;77 years old, the average age (49.47&#x000b1;16.32 years old), the control group of 13 cases of males, 17 cases of females, age 40&#x02013;72 years old, the average age (53.39&#x000b1;9.67 years old).

ROC analysis showed that LBP measured the area under the curve in the peripheral blood of STB patients with an area of 0.880 (P &#x0003c; 0.01), confirming that changes in LBP expression in STB peripheral blood make there a close relationship or special biological function between the two. In addition, the differential expression of LBP in many clinical diseases has also been shown to be associated with the occurrence of diseases, so it is speculated that LBP has the potential to be used as a diagnostic biomarker when detecting STB. This study found differential expression in peripheral blood between LBP and STB patients, and the relationship between LBP and STB was also reported for the first time.</p><p>After determining the value of LBP in the diagnosis of STB, we further analyzed its relevance to the clinical features of STB and found that the relative expression of LBP as a detection index in peripheral blood was positively correlated with ESR and CRP levels (P &#x0003c; 0.01). It is comparable to Wen,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> who reported that LBP is significantly correlated with elevated ESR and CRP in active disease, and has comparable value for disease prediction with ESR and CRP. There was no correlation between LBP and age, course, WBC, NEUT%, and LYM% (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05), which was basically consistent with the evaluation index of clinical STB. LBP performed a curve regression analysis of the positive results of pathology, bacteriological culture, T-SPOT, imaging and acid fast bacillus confirmed by STB, and found that the AUC between the two was 0.677, 0.707, 0.751, 0.714 and 0.656 (P &#x0003c; 0.01), indicating that LBP is valuable for STB diagnosis. Positive pathology and cell culture are the gold standards for the definitive diagnosis of STB, and ROC curve analysis was performed on STB patients with pathology and bacteriology positive, which found that LBP had a good correlation with pathology and bacteriological culture, confirming that LBP can be used for the diagnostic evaluation of STB. T-SPOT has a significant correlation of 88% and 90% in the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing spinal tuberculosis,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and LBP has an area of 0.751 under the T-SPOT curve, indicating that LBP has a significant correlation with T-SPOT, which has good sensitivity and specificity for detecting STB and can be used as a diagnostic marker for the diagnosis of STB. MRI and CT in imaging have higher sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of STB,<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and there is also a good correlation in the analysis of the ROC curve of LBP in the diagnosis of MRI and CT, which indicates that LBP has high diagnostic value for STB and can be used as an evaluation factor for its diagnosis. The specificity and sensitivity of AFB in the detection of STB were 87.0% and 85.9%, respectively, and the positive curve regression results of LBP showed that the two were correlated, which had a synergistic effect in the diagnostic evaluation of STB. Combined with the reports that LBP as a biomarker for evaluating rheumatoid arthritis sensitivity, evaluating the prediction of cardiac insufficiency prognosis after radiation therapy for breast cancer, and distinguishing mastocytosis, there are significant differences in peripheral blood expression of LBP in many clinical diseases, which indicates that LBP is indeed closely related to clinical diseases.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In this study, the statistical analysis of the differences and clinical phenotypes of LBP in the peripheral blood of STB patients was screened and found that it has the potential as a biomarker in the diagnosis of STB.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study found for the first time that LBP has stable differential expression in the peripheral blood of STB patients, which has high diagnostic value in the analysis of ESR, CRP, pathology and imaging indicators, and has the potential as a molecular marker for STB diagnosis; LBP may also play an important role in the study of STB pathogenesis-related mechanisms, but the specific functional mechanism still needs to be further explored. The shortcoming of this study is that the sample size collected is relatively small, LBP protein needs to be validated as a diagnostic biomarker for clinical use in STB with expanded samples.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s0006"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>LBP, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; STB, Spinal tuberculosis; WBC, white blood cell; CRP, C-reactive protein; ESR, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate; T-SPOT, T-cell spot test for tuberculosis infection; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; AUC, area under the curve; TMT, Tandem Mass Tag; AFB, acid fast bacillus; MRI, Magnetic Resonance Diffusion Tension Imaging; CT, computerized tomography; NEUT, neutrophilic granulocyte; LYM, lymphocyte.</p></sec><sec id="s0007"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>The datasets used and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec><sec id="s0008"><title>Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate</title><p>Approval for the study was obtained from the ethics committee of General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University.

We report a case of acute hemorrhagic primary malignant melanoma of the spinal cord, including its presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Illustrative Case</title><p>The patient, a 37-year-old male, had reportedly been complaining of 1 month of neck pain followed by sudden-onset quadriplegia and difficulty breathing. After being intubated at an outside hospital, the patient was transferred to our tertiary referral center after magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine with and without contrast enhancement demonstrated an intramedullary spinal cord tumor spanning C1&#x02013;6 with a hemorrhagic component (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Upon arrival, the patient had Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 2/5 strength in the upper and lower extremities on the left side with decreased sensation to light touch. Strength and sensation on the right had improved to full strength. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was started on intravenous dexamethasone with a plan to take him to the operating room (OR) within 24 hours.</p><fig position="float" id="f1"><label>FIG. 1.</label><caption><p>Sagittal MRI T1-weighted postcontrast image with contrast-enhancing intramedullary mass.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CASE21542f1" position="float"/></fig><p>Further metastatic work-up of MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine with and without intravenous contrast agent revealed findings of subarachnoid tumor spread along the surface of the spinal cord around T10&#x02013;11 and conus medullaris (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not reveal any other obvious metastatic lesions.</p><fig position="float" id="f2"><label>FIG. 2.</label><caption><p>Sagittal MRI T1-weighted postcontrast image with enhancement along the conus medullaris and cauda equina concerning for leptomeningeal disease. <italic toggle="yes">Arrows</italic> identify areas of enhancement.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CASE21542f2" position="float"/></fig><sec><title>Operative Procedure</title><p>The patient was taken to the OR, and general anesthesia was induced. Baseline motor and sensory evoked potentials were obtained and demonstrated lower motor evoked responses on the left, consistent with his examination. The patient was positioned prone on a Jackson table with hip and chest pads, and his head was placed in a Mayfield head holder. The posterior cervical region was prepared and draped in a sterile fashion. A midline incision was made extending from the base of the occiput to C7. The posterior cervical fascia was exposed, and dissection was performed in a subperiosteal manner exposing C1&#x02013;5. After drilling troughs, C2&#x02013;5 was removed en bloc. The dura was incised in the midline and tacked back with Nurolon sutures. The underlying arachnoid mater was then incised using microscissors. The midline raphe was cauterized using bipolars, and the pia mater was incised using an 11-blade scalpel. Microinstruments were used to dissect in the midline and approached abnormal tissue within a few millimeters.</p><p>Microdissection continued circumferentially and both rostrally and caudally to expose the poles with debulking of the tumor using pituitary rongeurs and bipolar electrocautery. Multiple bridging vessels were cauterized and cut with microscissors until finally the tumor was lifted off of the spinal cord. No obvious remaining tumor was visualized around the edges of the resection cavity. There was some reduction in motor and sensory potentials during the resection, but monitorable signals remained at the end of the resection. There was some amount of hematoma that delivered itself during the resection; however, myelotomy was not extended to remove any additional hematoma.</p><p>The dura was closed in a watertight manner with a running 4-0 Nurolon suture. The C2&#x02013;5 laminoplasty was then placed using the Medtronic centerpiece set. Plates and screws were used to secure the lamina to the lateral mass at each level. Adherus sterile sealant was used around the dural edges, followed by Clorpactin pulse lavage and then bacitracin irrigation. Powdered vancomycin was used inside the wound, and a Hemovac drain was placed. The deep and superficial fascial layers were then closed with interrupted 0 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was stapled closed.</p><p>The patient tolerated surgery well and was extubated on postoperative day 2. After surgery, the patient had progressive improvement in sensation and strength to MRC grade 4/5, and postoperative MRI demonstrated gross total resection (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, the patient developed neurogenic bladder requiring in-and-out catheterization. The patient was transferred out of the ICU after mean arterial pressure goals &#x0003e;85 mm Hg were achieved for 7 days, and he was discharged to an acute rehabilitation center on postoperative day 11.</p><fig position="float" id="f3"><label>FIG. 3.</label><caption><p>Sagittal MRI T1-weighted postcontrast image with resolution of intramedullary mass and some residual blood products.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CASE21542f3" position="float"/></fig><p>Histopathological analysis confirmed melanoma, demonstrating epithelioid and spindle-shaped cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and positive staining for CD10, melan-A, and SOX10.

The patient was seen in follow-up by ophthalmology, dermatology, and gastroenterology to find a potential primary source, which was unremarkable. In addition, he was seen in follow-up with radiation oncology and hematology-oncology to receive adjuvant radiation therapy and immunotherapy consisting of nivolumab and ipilimumab, respectively.</p><p>At 1-year follow-up, the patient had returned to work full-time. On physical examination, he had some persistent numbness in his legs, but his postoperative weakness had completely resolved.

This consists of ruling out extra-CNS lesions with a full-body PET-CT scan and thorough dermatologic, ophthalmologic, gastrointestinal, and gynecological evaluations followed by histopathologic confirmation.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> This has limitations, however, because achromic cutaneous melanomas exist, and metastatic melanomas of the skin can appear after complete disappearance of a primitive melanoma.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Histologically, melanoma is characterized by large, pleomorphic epithelioid or spindled cells with irregular nuclei, necrosis, and high mitotic index and positive staining for HMB-45 and S100 protein.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Lessons</title><p>Identifying and differentiating primary spinal cord melanoma from metastatic melanoma is important due to its better prognosis. Primary CNS melanomas grow slower and seem to be less malignant than cutaneous melanomas.<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Life expectancy for metastatic cutaneous melanomas is typically &#x0003c;1 year, whereas the mean survival for primary spinal cord melanomas has been reported at 6 years and 7 months.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Recurrences have been reported, including in the original tumor bed itself and via leptomeningeal dissemination.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>There is little research on the management and prognosis of primary spinal cord melanoma. Resection has been advocated as the treatment of choice for primary spinal melanomas.

As a consequence, the sensory and motion function and muscle reflection will degrade in the upper extremity. Surgical treatments are needed to reduce the neurothlipsis and relieve the pain. Conservative treatments including pharmacotherapy (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants and steroid injections), traction therapy, physical therapy and manipulative therapy are useful for pain relief but may not impede degenerative changes. Surgical treatments can achieve complete decompression and maintain cervical alignment and are superior to conservative treatments. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) was firstly proposed by Smith and Robinson in 1958 and was regarded as an effective operation by many researchers.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref></p><p>Although ACDF is one of the safest and most commonly performed spine operations, its defects and complications have been extensively reported in the last decades. Morishita et al found that respiratory difficulty, pneumonia and dysphagia occurred in patients treated with ACDF.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Hironen et al reported that young adults who underwent ACDF are susceptible to accelerated degeneration in the adjacent cervical disc, leading to adjacent segment diseases.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Pseudoarthrosis, hardware failure and anterior approach-related complications were also reported.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Microscope-assisted ACDF was proposed to decrease the intraoperative complications, including esophagus and tracheal and dural injuries. Yao et al reported that 48 patients treated with microscope-assisted ACDF achieved satisfactory improvement in JOA and VAS with complications occurring in 11.11% of them.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>However, the optimal surgical method for unilateral cervical radiculopathy is still controversial. Kato et al reported that both anterior and posterior approaches show similar neurological recovery and quality of life improvement, whereas, anterior surgery is associated with a higher rate of reoperation.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Adamson et al reported that among the 100 cases of cervical radiculopathy treated with percutaneous endoscopic cervical foraminotomy (PECF), 97 obtained satisfactory recovery and can return to their daily life.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Thus, this minimally invasive method attracted increasing interest and was regarded as a feasible procedure. Some researchers reckon that PECF can achieve pain relief while avoiding neck anatomical injury and complications. Shu et al reported that 32 patients undergoing PECF showed satisfying clinical outcomes and concluded that PECF could enable nerve root decompression better than ACDF.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In the aspect of cost, Mansfield et al reported that the average cost of ACDF is significantly higher than that of minimally invasive posterior cervical foraminotomy ($8192 &#x000b1; 3155 VS $4230 &#x000b1; 1719, P &#x0003c; 0.001).<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Studies on the comparison between clinical and radiological outcomes of PECF and microscope-assisted ACDF are rare, and whether PECF can improve clinical recovery and diminish complications has not been deeply analyzed. This paper aims to analyze the therapy efficacy of these two methods and verify (1) whether PECF can provide a better pain-relieving effect and larger cervical range of motion (ROM) for patients with cervical radiculopathy; (2) whether PECF leads to fewer complications; (3) whether patients treated with PECF show better outcomes during follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Patients</title><p>All data were collected from medical records. Inclusion criteria: (1) patients over 25 with single-level unilateral cervical radiculopathy (paracentral type); (2) patients that had undergone failed palliative therapy for at least 3 months; (3) patients with minimal 2 years of follow-up visit after the PECF or ADCF treatment. Exclusive criteria: (1) patients with cervical spine surgical history; (2) patients with cervical abnormalities including hemivertebrae, block vertebrae and butterfly vertebrae; (3) patients with other comorbidities such as tumor, rheumatic arthritis and tuberculosis; (4) patients with prolapse or calcification of lumbar intervertebral disc. All cases were regarded as good candidates for these two procedures after two senior spinal surgeons uninvolved in the care of these subjects reviewed their radiology report, medical history and physical examination report.

Then, pathological segment was confirmed by C-arm after exposure, and the relative anatomical structure was distracted. The osteophytes around the vertebrae, if any, were removed. The intervertebral disc and cartilaginous endplate were completely removed with a microscope. Herniated disc and nerve root were completely decompressed without causing dura injury. Next, intervertebral cages (VENTURE, Medtronic, Minnesota, USA), plates and screws (VENTURE, Medtronic, Minnesota, USA) were inserted for fixation and fusion. A drain was placed, and it was removed after 24 h.</p></sec><sec id="s0002-s2004"><title>PECF Group</title><p>The procedure of PECF was similar to that in papers.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Firstly, patients took a prone position with a mattress under their forehead, chest and abdomen after general anesthesia. The entry point was marked by intraoperative C-arm, which is located on the superior border of the inferior lamina of the pathologic segment near the medial of the facet joint on the herniated side. All of the instruments were included in the cervical foraminal system (Joimax, Germany). An 18-gauge puncture needle was inserted and was pushed through the marked point until reaching the inferior lamina with the assistance of the C-arm. An incision around 8 mm was made above the V-point (the medial junction of the inferior and superior facet joint), then the guidewire was placed, and the needle was withdrawn. The 6.9-mm obturator, 8.0-mm oblique working channel and 4.1-mm endoscope were set sequentially with continuous saline solution irrigation. After the identification of the V-point, the overlying soft tissue was removed with endoscopic forceps. After the bone structure was exposed, the lower margin of the superior lamina was drilled laterally toward the facet joint and caudally to the pedicle. Then, the intersection of the ascending facet with the inferior laminae was drilled with a radius around half of the facet length.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The ligamentum flavum and foraminal ligament were removed so that the probe could be easily inserted into the foramen and the dural sac and outgoing nerve were visible. The protruding nucleus pulposus, which is usually beneath the nerve root, was located, and it was resected by tissue forceps. Before removing the working channel, it was confirmed that the nerve root was completely decompressed (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).<fig position="float" id="f0001" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A 46-year-old female who suffered from C6/7 unilateral cervical radiculopathy and treated with percutaneous endoscopic cervical foraminotomy.

In addition, radicular pain will be accentuated if the compressed nerve root is stretched by some cervical motions like sneezing and coughing. The treatment objectives of cervical radiculopathy are immediate pain relief, complete decompression of nerve root and function improvement. ACDF is a widely used operation for cervical radiculopathy. Previous studies reported that after ACDF treatment, patients with cervical radiculopathy achieved gratified neurologic function improvement and pain alleviation. Burkhardt et al conducted a study in which 80 patients with cervical disc herniation who underwent ACDF complained about radicular pain and sensory disturbance, 70 (87.5%) patients were free of radicular pain and 78 patients achieved neurologic function improvement.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Jenkins reported that 51 patients with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) score &#x0003c;5 who underwent ACDF all showed significant improvement in Short Form-12 Physical Component Score (SF-12 PCS) and NDI during 1-year follow-up (46.5 &#x000b1; 8.3 and 20 &#x000b1; 18.4 VS 39.1 &#x000b1; 9.3 and 25.8 &#x000b1; 15.8, P &#x0003c; 0.05).<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>However, there were multiple complications reported after ACDF. According to the study of Epstein in 2019, anatomical complications including immediate postoperative dysphagia, laryngeal nerve palsy, and even esophagus and tracheal injuries are the most frequently reported complications. Surgery-related complications include surgery site infection, new radicular symptoms, hematoma, adjacent segment degeneration, cerebrospinal fluid leakage and internal fixation failure.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> They are also common, with an occurrence rate of around 6&#x02013;13.8%. The rare but severe complications are internal jugular venous thrombosis, pseudarthrosis and epidural hematoma.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> Wichmann et al conducted a study with 410 patients with cervical radiculopathy and undergoing ACDF treatment. Clinical outcomes such as VAS, NDI and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were significantly improved, the complication rates were 2.4% intraoperatively and 1.2% postoperatively.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Microscope-assisted ACDF can diminish the rate of esophagus injury and dural injury. However, in the research of Adogwa et al, where 59 patients were treated with microscope-assisted ACDF and 81 underwent ACDF without the use of a microscope, no significant difference in the rate of complication was found.<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition, Omidi-Kashani et al reported that patients younger than 45 who underwent microscope-assisted ACDF showed better recovery in NDI than patients older than 45 (10.1 &#x000b1; 9.5 VS 15.8 &#x000b1; 4.6, P &#x0003c; 0.05). This result indicates that patients older than 45 benefit more from microscope-assisted ADCF than younger patients.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> As a consequence, PECF was proposed by Roh et al. They performed posterior cervical foraminotomy under an endoscope in four cadavers. After CT scan evaluation, significantly better decompression diameter and facet joint removal percentage were achieved when compared with the traditional open technique.<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Subsequent studies reported gratified outcomes after PECF. Zheng et al reported that among 249 patients with single-level cervical disc herniation treated with PECF, 216 (86.7%) had no or minimal pain, and 33 had occasional pain; in addition, no patient presented adjacent segment degeneration during follow-up.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>In this study, we retrospectively collected and compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of 127 patients (68 in ACDF, 59 in PECF). Significantly longer operation time and shorter hospital stay were found in PECF group (3.7 &#x000b1; 1.3 d and 66.8 &#x000b1; 6.8 mins VS 6.8 &#x000b1; 1.5 d and 59.4 &#x000b1; 9.1mins, P &#x0003c; 0.001). The reasons could be that the location of the surgical site and installation of the endoscope take time. PECF is a microinvasive, minimally invasive technique which is regarded as one of the ERAS techniques in spine surgery, so the hospital stay was significantly shorter than ACDF.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> As for the clinical outcomes, the two surgical methods both contribute to significant improvement. The PECF group showed significantly better pain relief and a higher NDI score than the ACDF group in 1-month follow-up, but no significant difference was found in other follow-up periods. Some studies showed similar results of neurological function recovery. Lee et al reported that among 76 patients with motor weakness and undergoing PECF, 72 showed significantly recovered neurological function and 65 had a normal neurological function at the end of follow-up.<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Terai et al reported that grip strength on the lesion site was significantly improved (from 30kg to 35kg) in patients after PECF.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> These results indicate that PECF exerts little influence on neck muscle and can verify whether the nerve root is completely decompressed visually. It was reported that the protection of the neck muscle of the cervical spine could better maintain the cervical ROM and reduce axial symptoms,<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> which could be a convincible explanation why the PRCF group had significantly better improvement in VAS and NDI.</p><p>And there were 10 patients suffered from complication after ACDF and 2 patients in PECF (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Fountas et al reported that overall complication rate was 19.3% (196 of 1015 patients). The most common complication was dysphagia in 9.5% and postoperative hematoma occurred in 5.6%.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> And Zhang et al reported a meta analysis and concluded that complications of patients with PECF were lower than ACDF (P &#x0003c; 0.05).<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Radiological outcomes were also compared in this study. The PECF group achieves more significant recovery in SA, CA and ROM in 12- and 24-month follow-up visits than the ACDF group (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Whereas the ADCF group shows a more significant recovery in DH than the PECF group in 12- and 24-month follow-up visits (P &#x0003c; 0.05). The ROM-related result in this study is consistent with that in the research of Kim et al, who measured the instantaneous axis of rotation (IAR) via extension and flexion cervical X-ray of 11 patients treated with PECF and found that the IAR was significantly improved at the surgical segment, especially at C5/6 and C6/7 (P = 0.02).<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Ke et al found that the range of motion (ROM) of operation level was significantly improved (7.27 &#x000b1; 1.75&#x000b0; VS 8.48 &#x000b1; 2.67&#x000b0;, P = 0.02) and the ROM of C2-7 was better, but there was no statistical significance.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Chen et al performed a finite element study and found that ACDF exerts a remarkable impact on intervertebral disc pressure and ROM of the surgical segment, whereas there was no significant difference in intervertebral disc pressure and ROM after posterior cervical foraminotomy.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>As for DH, Lin reported that DH of the surgical segment of 55 patients treated with ACDF was more significantly increased than that of patients treated with posterior cervical foraminotomy.<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Disc height of surgical segment increases after ACDF mainly because ACDF can provide stronger support on anterior column by hardware fixation. The possible reason why PECF shows better improvements in ROM, CA and SA is that ACDF immobilized the vertebral body by plate and cage, while PECF only removed herniated disc.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has some limitations. First, this is a study with small sample size and single center, and further prospective study should be conducted for enhancing the credibility of study. Second, the follow-up period of this study was short, and some complications such as reoperation and implementation failure may be observed with longer follow-up visit. Lastly, some life habits, such as smoking and physical exercise which could have an influence on outcomes, cannot be obtained due to retrospective study.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cervical radiculopathy was always treated with ACDF, but patients may experience a lot of complications and accelerate adjacent segment degeneration. PECF could be an effective alternative method which can achieve better pain relief, neurologic function recovery and ROM of cervical, decreasing hospital stay and complications. However, the disc herniation type needs to pay more attention before operation because PECF is unsuitable for central cervical disc herniation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The study was supported by the Nature Science Foundation of Zhejiang (LY19H060002), National Nature Foundation of China (81572217) and Social Welfare Research Key Project of Ningbo (2021S105).

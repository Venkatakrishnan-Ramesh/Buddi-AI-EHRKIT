It is urgent to screening OSAHS from hypertensive patients. An ideal effective questionnaire screening approach for OSAHS is lacking. In this study, we aimed to explore a new OSAHS screening method via weighted combining the current used Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ) upon calculation.</p></sec><sec id="s2002"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Three hundred and sixteen hypertensive patients with suspicion of the OSAHS were enrolled and randomized in the study into ESS, SBQ and portable respiratory polysomnography (RP) tests. The predictive value of ESS, SBQ and weighted combination were evaluated by calculating the area under curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s2003"><title>Results</title><p>Both the two scales alone and weighted combination were closely related with apnea hypopnea index (AHI), minimum oxygen saturation and average oxygen saturation at night (P &#x0003c; 0.05). The AUC, sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of ESS in predicting OSAHS were 79.0%, 74.8%, 75.6%, 80.1% and 57.5%, respectively. For SBQ, they were 73.6%, 67.0%, 68.6%, 65.1% and 75.2%, respectively. In contrast, the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the combined approach were 82.5%, 73.9% and 82.6%.</p></sec><sec id="s2004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The weighted combination of ESS and SBQ could improve the diagnostic ability of OSAHS in patients with hypertension, not only in the accuracy and sensitivity, but also for its easy procedure and accessibility and in hospital. Therefore, the weighted combination approach of ESS and SBQ is promising for OSAHS screening.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>weighted combination</kwd><kwd>Epworth sleepiness scale</kwd><kwd>STOP-bang questionnaire</kwd><kwd>obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="8"/><ref-count count="16"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) caused intermittent hypoxemia and hypercapnia due to the repeated partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep and resulted in hypoventilation or apnea,<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and OSAHS is closely related with refractory hypertension and high morbidity and mortality.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It is reported that the prevalence in OSAHSA is increasing, affecting at least 25% adults, and it is as high as 49% of the elderly population.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, the number of patients with moderate and/or severe OSAHS has reached 425 million worldwide aged from 30 to 69 years.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It should be noted that hypertension is closely related with OSAHS.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> 30&#x02013;50% of hypertensive patients have OSAHS and 50&#x02013;92% of patients with OSAHS are accompanied by hypertension.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> OSAHS and hypertension are risky, let alone they simultaneously occurred. Therefore, it is clinically important to diagnose OSAHS symptom in hypertensive patients.</p><p>The gold standard for the diagnosis of OSAHS is Polysomnography (PSG). However, it required specific environment, complicated procedure, time-consuming and long-time appointment in advance in addition to the expensive cost and inconvenient use.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Increasing researchers are recommending the use of portable respiratory polysomnography (RP) for sleep monitoring. However, it is limited by the 7-h wearing of specific monitor and half an hour to analyze the data. To address this dilemma, questionnaire approaches have been developed for clinical screening of OSAHS, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the STOP-Bang Questionnaire (SBQ) and Berlin questionnaire.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> They are convenient, easy for data analysis, have acceptable sensitivity, and specificity. Comparison has been performed between these questionnaires, and each of these methods has advantages and deficiencies indeed.

Considering that the ESS score is mainly based on subjective cognition and the SBQ scores are mainly based on objective index, we develop a screening approach by weighted combining the ESS and SBQ based on calculation and evaluate its predicting values for OSAHS in Chinese hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Subjects</title><p>A total of 316 hypertensive patients with suspicion of OSAHS in the hypertension outpatient department of Zhejiang Provincial People&#x02019;s Hospital and the hypertension prevention and treatment center of Yiwu City were enrolled from October 2018 to September 2020.

Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of OSAHS among hypertensive patients is urgent. The current used OSAHS screening questionnaires, such as ESS and SBQ, both have merits and drawbacks. We investigated the potential of combining ESS and SBQ for OSAHS screening among hypertensive patients so as to taking the merit of ESS in subjective cognition and the advantage of SBQ in objective index together.</p><p>The ESS developed by Johns MW was to evaluate patients with inexplicable daytime lethargy or fatigue, and it is widely used in clinical OSAHS screening.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Other data from patients, such as BMI, age, neck circumference, and gender should be taken into consideration to improve the accuracy of ESS when screening OSAHS from hypertensive patients. It should be noted that other factors, such as diseases (episodic sleeping sickness and restless legs, the hangover effect of long-term oral sedative-hypnotic drugs), occupational related factors (jobs like health-care workers and drivers in three-shifts style) could induce daytime lethargy or fatigue. All these factors would affect the accuracy of OSAHS screening. In the present study, we obtained a significant higher specificity (75.6%) and lower sensitivity (74.8%) than Wang&#x02019;s results (sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 48%) in ESS for OSAHS screening, indicating notable variations using ESS alone. However, the sensitivity and specificity could achieve as high as 93% and 86%, respectively, when ESS was combined with oxygen desaturation index,<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> suggesting the results of ESS for OSAHS screening could be improved via combining with other factors. In addition, ESS score is a subjective assessment method without clear and uniform scoring criteria, thus significant variations existed and conclusion from certain study could not fit all population.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>STOP-Bang score is based on the STOP questionnaire (SBQ, snoring, fatigue, sleep apnea, hypertension) and supplemented with factors like BMI, age, neck circumference and gender. SBQ had good reliability and validity in screening for OSAHS.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> But, other factors, such as race, may potentially affect the SBQ screening ability for OSAHS. Yu&#x02019;s screening result from 148 patients with suspected OSAHS using SBQ demonstrated a significantly higher sensitivity (85.6%) than our result in this study (67.0%),<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> the variation is probably caused by the larger BMI of patients in the Yu&#x02019;s study (29.6 &#x000b1; 3.3) than that of the patients in this study (27.2 &#x000b1; 3.4). The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the SBQ alone in this study was 67.0%, 68.6% and 73.6%, respectively, indicating an unmet need in screening ability when using SBQ alone.</p><p>In this study, we found that the specificity and AUC (82.6% and 82.5%) were significantly higher than those from ESS (75.6% and 79.0%) and SBQ alone (68.6% and 73.6%, respectively) after weighted combination of ESS and SBQ. The possible reason is that we emphasize the sensitivity and specificity while taking both subjective and objective factors into consideration in the weighted combination. It is superior to ESS in terms of dependence on patients&#x02019; cognition. On the other hand, it makes up for the disadvantage of SBQ&#x02019;s depending on objective factors. The weighted SBQ can emphasize the importance of objective factors without neglecting subjective factors, which could comprehensively reflect the basic situation of patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Limitations</title><p>Firstly, this study combined the ESS and SBQ as a new tool for predicting OSAHS, and we found that the sensitivity and AUC were less than ideal. It may be necessary to re-select other indicators from the hypertensive patients to further improve OSAHS screening ability. Secondly, only 2 study centers were included in this study, and the clinical significance of this approach needs to be verified in more centers in the future. Lastly, this study uses RP as a diagnostic tool for OSAHS rather than polysomnography, which may affect our results. Further studies using polysomnography are needed to confirm our findings.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The weighted combination of ESS and SBQ significantly improved the diagnostic ability of OSAHS in patients with hypertension, not only in the accuracy and sensitivity, but also for its easy procedure and accessibility and in hospital. The higher prediction value making the weighted combination approach an easy and promising screening tool in clinical screening OSAHS from hypertensive patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by Zhejiang Province Basic Public Welfare Research Program Project (Grant No. LGF20H020009) and Taizhou Science and Technology Plan Project (No: 22ywb105).</p></ack><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0007"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.

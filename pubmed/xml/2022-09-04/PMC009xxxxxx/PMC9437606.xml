An I portal is then created (placement demonstrated in cutout) and gives a straight-on approach to the coracoid. Next an H portal is created directly over the coracoid process. This portal is used to remove fibrous tissue from the site of the nonunion with a radiofrequency ablator and arthroscopic shaver. A guidewire is placed on the tip if the coracoid through the I portal. A switching stick or probe, placed through the H portal, is used to stabilize the distal fragment while the k-wire is inserted. This k-wire is also used to joystick the distal fragment into anatomic position. Cannulated drill is placed over the guidewire, and then a 4.5&#x000a0;mm cannulated screw is placed.

They used the coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments as a dividing line between type I and type II fractures. Type I fractures fall proximal to the CC ligaments, and type II fractures occur distal to the CC ligaments. In their article, 53 of the fractures they examined were type I fractures, and 11 were type II fractures.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Type I fractures represent a unique injury to the shoulder and in severe situations can lead to disruption of the superior suspensory shoulder complex (SSSC). One of the key components of the SSSC is the CC ligament, and a type I fracture by its nature destabilizes the SSSC. For this reason operative fixation of type I fractures was advocated, whereas conservative management of type II fractures was recommended.</p><p id="p0020">Knapik et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> also advocate for conservative management of isolated coracoid fractures. They reviewed 19 coracoid fractures, 16 of which were managed without surgery.

Indications for operative fixation include systematic nonunion, greater than 1&#x000a0;cm displacement, or less than 1&#x000a0;cm of displacement if there is concomitant shoulder instability or disruption of the SSSC.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p id="p0030">Several methods of fixation exist for coracoid fractures, and most are performed using a standard deltopectoral approach. To our knowledge there is only a single report of arthroscopic fixation of an Ogawa type I fracture and no reported cases of arthroscopic fixation of an Ogawa type II fracture.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> This case will highlight the first reported use of arthroscopy to debride a Type II coracoid nonunion, as well as the use of arthroscopic assisted percutaneous fixation of a Type II coracoid fracture.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Patient Evaluation</title><p id="p0035">Evaluation of a patient with a coracoid fracture or nonunion begins with a full shoulder examination. It is important to assess range of motion, strength, as well as any level of tenderness to palpation over the fracture site.</p><p id="p0040">It is important to get anteroposterior (AP), Grashey, scapular Y, and axillary views to completely evaluate the coracoid. Further delineation of the fracture should be obtained by computed tomography scanning. Addition of 3-dimensional reconstruction can be very beneficial when it comes to determining the age or chronicity of a coracoid fracture. In certain situations, magnetic resonance imaging may be warranted to rule out concomitant shoulder pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging can also help with determining the acuity or chronicity of the fracture. Examples of these images are included in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> to <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Grashey view of a right shoulder.

A mechanical arm holder (Spider; Smith &#x00026; Nephew, London, UK) is placed on the Clark rail on the leaf at the head of the bed for improved arm manipulation and positioning. This allows for standing in front of the patient unimpeded by the arm holder. A 30&#x000b0; scope is used for the entirety of the case. There is no need to change to a 70&#x000b0; scope because of the use of multiple arthroscopic portals.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Arthroscopic Technique</title><p id="p0060">A standard posterior viewing portal is established, as well as an anterior portal created under direct visualization. These portals correspond roughly with the A and E portals in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>, respectively. After the anterior portal is established, an arthroscopic shaver is introduced to complete a thorough debridement of the rotator interval. This is demonstrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>. This is necessary to fully visualize the coracoid process. A combination of shaver and radiofrequency ablation is used to complete this step.<fig id="fig6"><label>Fig 6</label><caption><p>A right shoulder in a patient in the beach chair position.

Glenoid indicated by <italic>green arrow</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr6"/></fig></p><p id="p0065">Once the lateral edge of the coracoid is visualized the radiofrequency ablator can be used to remove soft tissue. This step is demonstrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>. The Coracoacromial ligament is encountered at the anterolateral aspect of the coracoid process and can be released partially for visualization but, unlike in the arthroscopic Latarjet, does not need to be fully released.<fig id="fig7"><label>Fig 7</label><caption><p>A right shoulder in a patient in the beach chair position. The lateral edge of the coracoid process is being viewed from a standard posterior portal (A portal). A standard 30&#x000b0; scope is being used. The arthroscopic ablator is inserted through a standard anterior accessory portal (E portal). The coracoid is highlighted by the <italic>red arrow</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig></p><p id="p0070">While viewing from the posterior A portal, an anterolateral portal is created (D portal). The camera is then switched to the D portal, and the ablator is moved to the E portal to begin clearing the superior surface of the coracoid. The D portal allows for clear visualization of the tip of the coracoid process and the conjoined tendon, as well as an en face view of the glenoid. Care must be taken at this time to clear soft tissue medial to the coracoid process fracture. Moving excessively medial to the coracoid process places the axillary nerve at risk. The ablator can be used to bluntly dissect medial until the axillary nerve is identified. This minimizes iatrogenic injury to the axillary nerve.</p><p id="p0075">While visualizing through the D portal, the I portal is established under direct visualization. The I portal is an anterior inferolateral portal that is roughly in line with the conjoined tendon. This portal is used for placement of a K-wire, as well as the cannulated screw. The ablator is then inserted into the I portal, and a small rent is made in the conjoined tendon at the tip of the coracoid through which the K-wire and cannulated screw will be placed. A blunt trocar is inserted through the E portal and is used to assess mobility at the fracture site.</p><p id="p0080">Using a spinal need the H portal is created under direct visualization. The H portal is directly inline and superior to the tip of the coracoid process. Once this portal is established, the ablator can be transitioned to the H portal, and a thorough debridement of the superior surface of the coracoid process is completed. It is important to debride any and all fibrous tissue that has developed at the site of the nonunion. This may require releasing a small portion of the pectoralis minor tendon depending on the location of the fracture to prevent it from being a deforming force on the coracoid. Radiofrequency ablation, the arthroscopic shaver, or a combination of the two can be used to debride the nonunion. Once all fibrous tissue is removed, the shaver or a burr is used to debride the bone edges back to fresh bleeding bone. This step is demonstrated in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>.<fig id="fig8"><label>Fig 8</label><caption><p>A right shoulder in a patient in the beach chair position. The coracoid nonunion is being visualized with the scope in an accessory anterolateral portal (D portal). The arthroscopic shaver is introduced through an accessory portal directly superior to the coracoid process (H portal). The arthroscopic shaver is being used to debride all the fibrous tissue away from the fracture site. The fibrous tissue is debrided back to fresh bleeding bone edges on the coracoid process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr8"/></fig></p><p id="p0085">A drill guide can now be introduced through the I portal and placed on the tip of the coracoid process. This step is demonstrated in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>. An arthroscopic probe can be inserted into the H portal to help stabilize and reduce the coracoid process as the K-wire is inserted. The K-wire can be driven through the center of the entire distal fragment and then used as a joystick to anatomically reduce the distal fragment to the proximal fragment. Once anatomic reduction is achieved, the K-wire can be advanced to the second cortex of the proximal coracoid. Care must be taken not to advance the K-wire too far because it can injure the suprascapular nerve within the suprascapular notch. A cannulated drill is then used to drill both the distal and proximal fragment. A 4.5&#x000a0;mm cannulated screw can be inserted over the guidewire. This step is demonstrated in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>. A blunt trocar can be inserted through the H portal to minimize coracoid rotation during screw insertion.<fig id="fig9"><label>Fig 9</label><caption><p>A right shoulder in a patient in the beach chair position. The coracoid is being viewed through an accessory anterolateral portal (D portal). The drill guide is inserted through an accessory antero-inferolateral portal (I portal). The drill guide used in this case is a Mitek Latarjet coracoid guide (Mitek, Johnson and Johnson); however, any cannulated drill guide can be used. The drill is placed at the tip of the coracoid process to allow a k-wire to be placed down the center of the coracoid process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr9"/></fig><fig id="fig10"><label>Fig 10</label><caption><p>A right shoulder in a patient in the beach chair position.

<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2"><caption><title>Video 1</title><p>Step-by-step completion of the arthroscopic fixation of a coracoid fracture. The rotator interval is cleaned out using a combination of arthroscopic shaver and radiofrequency ablators placed through the E portal and visualized from the A portal. The D portal is created (placement is highlighted in cutout). D portal is used to clear soft tissue off the lateral aspect of the coracoid and conjoined tendon. An I portal is then created (placement demonstrated in cutout) and gives a straight-on approach to the coracoid. Next an H portal is created directly over the coracoid process. This portal is used to remove fibrous tissue from the site of the nonunion with a radiofrequency ablator and arthroscopic shaver. A guidewire is placed on the tip if the coracoid through the I portal. A switching stick or probe, placed through the H portal, is used to stabilize the distal fragment while the k-wire is inserted. This k-wire is also used to joystick the distal fragment into anatomic position. Cannulated drill is placed over the guidewire, and then a 4.5&#x000a0;mm cannulated screw is placed. Final reduction and stability are checked with a switching stick.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.mp4"/></supplementary-material>

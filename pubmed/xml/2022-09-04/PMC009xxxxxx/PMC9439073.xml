While DXA provides accurate BMD measurements in vitro (eg, vertebrae in homogeneous fluid),<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> difficulties may arise, particularly in older individuals in whom factors such as vascular calcification, scoliosis, and spinal degeneration could cause diagnostic inaccuracies.

Three vertebrae with different cancellous bone densities were recorded from top to bottom, namely, V1, V2, and V3. The cancellous bone HAP content in the three vertebral bodies was 50 mg/cm<sup>3</sup>, 100 mg/cm<sup>3</sup>, and 200 mg/cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively.

We confirmed that the HAP (water) and HAP (fat) values of the same vertebra under different radiation doses were not significantly different, providing an experimental basis for future low-dose scanning. Our results also demonstrated that under different radiation doses, there was no significant difference in the RE between HAP (water), HAP (fat), and the true value, suggesting that the substance content measured by DesCT is stable under different radiation doses.</p><p>Previous studies<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> have reported that DesCT can be used to measure BMD; however, differences in the methodologies used exist between studies. We used energy spectrum imaging technology to scan the ESP and explore the accuracy of DesCT in measuring spine BMD in patients to lay the foundation for clinical application.</p><p>Material separation technology is a major feature of DesCT, and is based on the principle that the X-ray absorption characteristics of any tissue in the human body can be expressed by the other two basis materials.<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The main component of the lumbar vertebrae is HAP, which largely determines the BMD and reflects bone strength.<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The main components of ESP used in this study, namely, HAP and epoxy resin, are equivalent to HAP and water.</p><p>QCT is widely used to measure BMD in vivo.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Therefore, we compared HAP (water), HAP (fat), and HAP (average) by DesCT with BMD measured by QCT. In this study, the HAP (water) value measured by the DesCT material separation technology was lower than that of the corresponding area by QCT, which is consistent with the results of Mei et al.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The in vivo measurement of QCT BMD is affected by the vertebral body&#x02019;s fat content,<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> while the energy spectrum material separation technology uses HAP (water) as the basis material to measure BMD. However, the actual vertebral composition is complicated and includes not only HAP and water but also fat, a collagen matrix, and other substances; HAP content measured by energy spectrum material separation is also affected by other substances in the vertebra. Considering that the fat content of the bone marrow is closely related to BMD,<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> we measured HAP (fat) to evaluate BMD. Our results demonstrate that although HAP (water) and HAP (fat) measured by DesCT were significantly different from BMD values measured by QCT, there was no significant difference between BMD values and HAP (average).</p><p>The BMD values of cancellous bone measured with HAP (water), HAP (fat), and HAP (average) via the DesCT material separation method were significantly linearly correlated with BMD measured by QCT. The interclass correlation coefficient of the two measurements was significant, consistent with the results obtained by Mei et al,<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> indicating that cancellous BMD determined by the rapid kV-switching energy spectrum material separation method can be used for BMD evaluation.</p><p>Similar to our study, a study by Zhou et al<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of phantomless in vivo DesCT-based BMD quantification in comparison with QCT. However, unlike those authors, who performed linear regression analysis to measure the BMD values, we obtained the data through direct measurement, which is clinically convenient and fast, has low requirements on the measurer, and can be widely used in clinical settings. This study further grouped by BMD measured by QCT and found that HAP (average) measure by the DesCT was not significantly different from QCT in the diagnosis of osteopenia. Although the differences between DesCT and QCT were significant in the osteoporosis group, but the diagnostic consistency between the two methods was good. In the normal group HAP (average) measure by the DesCT lower than the BMD measured by QCT, which may make the DesCT more sensitive than QCT for osteopenia in the normal group. Therefore, it is appropriate to use HAP (average) to screen for osteoporosis in clinical work.</p><p>This study has certain limitations. First, when scanning the phantom for different radiation dose settings, three grades for the GSI mode were selected (low, medium, and high grade). There was no other energy grade paired. The measurement results could potentially be different if we were to use an ultra-low or ultra-high dose grade. Second, only human T12 vertebrae and L1 vertebrae were measured. Therefore, the measurement and analysis results of human T12 and L1 vertebrae still need further confirmation with other human vertebra specimens or in vivo studies. Third, there is no further classification of the population by age or sex. In future studies, it would be beneficial for the sample size to be expanded, further classified, and compared.</p><p>Thus, this phantom study confirmed the stability and good repeatability of the DesCT measurement of HAP. Moreover, the patients&#x02019; data demonstrated that DesCT can be used to predict BMD, and that HAP (average) can replace the QCT value, which requires larger sample sizes to confirm. As previous studies have shown, DesCT has many applications for chest and abdomen scanning, and has advantages over conventional CT in disease detection, disease diagnosis, and differentiation of benign and malignant tumours.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;33</xref> DesCT also has advantages in improving image quality and eliminating metal artefacts.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The diagnostic consistency between the between the HAP (average) values measured by DesCT and the BMD values measured by QCT was good. Therefore, we suggest that doctors can procure both image and BMD data in one scan with DesCT without the associated risks of additional radiation doses, which can greatly benefit the patient.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, DesCT measurement of the phantom BMD was stable and repeatable under different radiation doses. The diagnostic consistency between the DesCT and QCT was good. We demonstrated the feasibility of DesCT-based BMD assessment of the spine in a clinical setting.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s0006"><title>Data Sharing Statement</title><p>The data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0007"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Levin</surname>

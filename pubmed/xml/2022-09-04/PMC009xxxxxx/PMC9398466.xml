We herein report a case of aortogenic embolic stroke diagnosed by the presence of rich cholesterol crystals in the retrieved thrombus and review the previously reported cases. A woman in her 80s was transferred as an emergency due to consciousness disturbance, right conjugate deviation, and severe left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) and acute infarction in the territory. The MCA was recanalized by thrombectomy using an aspiration catheter and stent retriever, and the symptoms improved. Although the physiological examination did not detect the embolic source during hospitalization, pathological examination of the thrombus revealed atheroma with numerous cholesterol crystal clefts and intermixing of fibrin. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed based on the pathological results showed atheromatous lesions in the aortic arch as the embolic source. As a subsequent treatment, medications of a strong statin and an antiplatelet agent were continued, and the patient had no recurrence. The finding that the retrieved thrombus is a simple atheroma containing cholesterol crystals with poor hemocytes suggests embolism due to plaque rupture. Pathological examination of the thrombus obtained by thrombectomy is one of the useful diagnostic approaches for stroke etiology and the determination of its treatment. </p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>endovascular thrombectomy</kwd><kwd>thrombus</kwd><kwd>aortogenic embolic stroke</kwd><kwd>cholesterol crystal</kwd><kwd>pathology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cerebral infarction has a variety of pathogenesis and clinical categories and is diagnosed comprehensively by symptom, imaging, and physiological and hematological examinations.

A yellowish thrombus was retrieved in a single procedure by a combined technique using an aspiration catheter and stent retriever (<xref rid="g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). The MCA was completely recanalized (TICI 3), and the symptoms tended to improve immediately (<xref rid="g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).

A 3 mm marginal smooth isoechoic plaque at the right bifurcation of the internal carotid artery and a 1.3 mm hyperechoic plaque in the common carotid artery were detected, which were then judged to be stable plaques.

After 2 weeks, she was discharged to another hospital for rehabilitation without further recurrence.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Cholesterol crystals are commonly found in progressive atherosclerotic lesions. Lipoproteins accumulate in the arterial wall and are taken up by macrophages that then form into foam cells, which consequently form fibrous atheroma containing extracellular cholesterol. Free cholesterol in the intracellular and extracellular spaces of atherosclerotic plaques spontaneously self-organizes into metastable crystals, which then change into a plate-like structure, causing inflammatory and traumatic injury (plaque rupture).<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup><sup>)</sup></p><p>According to a report on the morphological analysis of atherosclerosis in the thoracic aorta, common carotid artery, and coronary arteries using autopsy specimens in chronological order, atheroma and necrotic core appeared in the early 40s in the aorta compared to the coronary arteries and common carotid artery and subsequently progressed and increased with age.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><sup>)</sup></p><p>The post-endovascular treatment MRI also showed embolic infarcts extending over multiple vascular territories, suggesting that a vulnerable aortic lesion could be the source even considering the possibility that it was an iatrogenic embolization caused by catheter manipulation during thrombectomy. Moreover, the pathological examination revealed a large amount of mixed fibrin components as well as cholesterol crystals by PTAH staining. This lends support to the risk that anticoagulation or fibrinolysis therapy may degrade the fibrin and induce cholesterol embolization syndrome.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup><sup>)</sup> A subsequent treatment that focuses on the administration of a strong statin that inhibit the development of atherosclerosis may be appropriate to prevent recurrence.</p><p>The histopathologic composition of the recovered thrombus and the etiology of stroke have been the subject of numerous studies. There are controversial reports that fibrin and platelets are more common in cardiogenic emboli (CE) and vice versa. In a 2017 report by Brinjikji et al., a systematic review found that the hyperdense artery sign was associated with red blood cell (RBC)-rich thrombus and higher recanalization rates, but not with the histopathological characteristics, etiology, or angiographic results.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup><sup>)</sup> In 2021, a meta-analysis of a large multicenter study of 1,350 cases revealed that large artery atherosclerosis thrombi had a higher mean RBC density and a lower platelet density than CE thrombi.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup><sup>)</sup> However, a more recent systematic review by Aliena-valero et al. that examined 134 eligible studies (97 cohort studies, 31 case reports, and 6 case series) has showed that the associations of thrombus size, structure, and composition with their etiology were inconsistent.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup><sup>)</sup></p><p>Meanwhile, there are no cohort studies examining the association between cholesterol crystals and embolic source in cerebral embolism. It is only stated on the premise that the thrombus containing them is atheroma in the studies that have assessed thrombectomy-induced wall damage, stiffness and elasticity of thrombus, or reperfusion rates.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup><sup>)</sup></p><p>In our extensive research, we found and review four case reports of the retrieved thrombus containing cholesterol crystals in cerebral embolism (as summarized <xref rid="t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup><sup>)</sup></p><table-wrap position="float" id="t001"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of previous reported cases of the retrieved thrombus with cholesterol crystals in cerebral embolism

In case 4, the large volume of red clot developed at the site of severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery and the character of the thrombi were noted to vary considerably, ranging from RBC-rich to platelet-rich. The authors speculated that some thrombi with the varied findings were formed due to secondary blood stasis after initial vessel occlusion.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup><sup>)</sup></p><p>By contrast, in case 2, case 3 and ours, diagnosed as plaque embolism from thoracic aorta, foam cells and cholesterol crystals were mainly detected with very few hemocyte component. Their thrombus was readily retrieved within a short time after the onset without multiple attempts, and no significant vessel stenosis that might trigger embolism or blood stasis was noted. A thrombus with simple atheromatous component only may represent embolism due to ruptured atheromatous plaques,<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup><sup>)</sup> suggesting the existence of vulnerable plaque lesion. In our case, the patient had the aorta with plaque of more than 4 mm in size and ulceration, and the plaque rupture was assumed to be the cause of the embolic stroke. Such complex aortic arch atherosclerosis is prevalent in ESUS patients and has been associated with atherosclerotic burden.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup><sup>)</sup></p><p>If the infarction site is also in other vascular territory and the retrieved thrombus contains a large amount of cholesterol crystals with poor hemocytes, AES should be suspected more aggressively than cardiogenic or paradoxical embolism. Recent study has shown that <sup>18</sup>F-sodium fluoride activity in the thoracic aorta on positron emission tomography is strongly associated with progressive atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke,<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup><sup>)</sup> which will be deemed useful for diagnosis of AES in the future.

Pathological examination of the thrombus obtained by thrombectomy may be a useful diagnostic approach for stroke etiology in individual cases and the determination of its treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>No funding was received for this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest Disclosure</title><p>Hidenori Oishi, a co-author, receives a donation in the form of a research fund to the endowed chair of his departments and about 1 million yen yearly from Medtronic Co., Ltd.

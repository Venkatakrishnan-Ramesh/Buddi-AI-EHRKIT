Up to 4.4% of preschoolers and 6.4% of elementary school children are reported to have asthma. Elucidating allergic factors for children with asthma is essential.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Exposure to allergens, such as house dust mites (HDM), cockroaches, pets, and pollen, triggers or even exacerbates bronchial hyperreactivity. In addition, allergic asthma is usually persistent and typically continues into adulthood as a chronic condition, cooccurring with several diseases, such as allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In recent decades, the mechanisms of allergic asthma have been extensively studied. Notably, increasing evidence indicates that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), among others, play important roles in allergic asthma.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are small noncoding RNA molecules of 18&#x02013;24 nucleotides in length, play a fundamental role in regulating gene expression by degrading mRNAs or inhibiting translation.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Due to their rich biofunctions and stability in serum, miRNAs show excellent potential to become biomarkers for the diagnosis of allergic asthma. Differentially expressed miRNAs are gradually being identified in the sputum, serum, and airway epithelium of patients with asthma and are closely related to asthma severity, asthma type, and asthma outcomes.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Despite advances in allergic asthma research, the accurate diagnosis and individualized treatment of allergic asthma still require in-depth study.</p><p>This study aimed to identify the expression profile of miRNAs in children diagnosed with allergic asthma with a clear etiology (house dust mites) using small RNA sequencing. A specific profile of miRNAs in PBMCs associated with allergic asthma in children was confirmed. Pathway enrichment analysis of targeted mRNAs of differentially expressed miRNAs revealed signalling pathways closely related to allergic asthma pathogenesis, such as the cGMP-PKG signalling pathway, cholinergic synapse, and salivary secretion.</p><p>The network analysis of the interactions between differentially expressed miRNAs and targeted mRNAs/pathways illustrated the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. Our study provides novel insights into understanding the pathogenesis of allergic asthma and illuminates some potential mechanisms of allergic asthma pathogenesis by analyzing differentially expressed miRNAs, which may be used to design novel therapeutic strategies and diagnostic biomarkers of allergic asthma.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Experimental Design</title><p>RNAs were extracted from PBMCs for high-throughput sequencing and a subsequent systematic bioinformatics analysis to explore differences in the expression profiles between healthy children and children suffering from allergic asthma.

From the results of GO analysis, the mechanisms of differentially expressed miRNAs affect the initiation and maintenance of allergic asthma in children. The analysis of biological processes (BPs) revealed that target mRNAs were enriched in transcription (DNA template), transcriptional regulation (DNA template), and signal transduction. The analysis of cellular components (CCs) implied that targeted mRNAs are localized to the cell membrane, nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane to perform their biological functions. The molecular function (MF) analysis suggested that target mRNAs are involved in metal ion binding, ATP binding, DNA binding, and RNA binding (<xref rid="f0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). On the other hand, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) mapping has been used to analyze mRNA products and functions during metabolic processes (<xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). According to KEGG classifications, we found that targeted mRNAs were significantly enriched in the cGMP-PKG signalling pathway, cholinergic synapse, and salivary secretion, among which the cGMP-PKG

Numerous researchers have established that ceRNA is a new transcriptional regulatory model whereby lncRNAs and circRNAs share the same miRNA response element (MRE) to indirectly inhibit the expression of miRNAs and weaken the interactions of miRNAs and mRNAs.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Importantly, these findings highlight the indispensable position and value for basic and translational research of miRNAs in allergic asthma.</p><p>Undeniably, the exploration of miRNAs associated with the frequent occurrence of allergic asthma in children is still in its infancy. Although the great potential of miRNAs to serve as biomarkers of airway-related has been revealed, the underlying mechanisms leading to airway hyperreactivity and the value of miRNAs as biomarkers of clinical outcomes and diagnostic biomarkers of allergic asthma, particularly in children, are enigmatic. Considerable evidence has confirmed the differential expression of miRNAs in the serum, sputum, bronchial biopsies, and bronchial epithelium of patients with asthma,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16&#x02013;18</xref> but most of these studies focused on the general definition of asthma. Similar to our findings, the expression of miRNAs was differentially altered in asthmatic mice and seasonal asthmatic mice. For example, Weidner et al<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> found that miRNAs, including miR-146a, miR-223, and miR-155, had the ability to distinguish between allergic asthma and nonallergic asthma in murine models, providing experimental evidence for miRNA involvement in allergic asthma. Additionally, the phenomenon of differential expression of miRNAs in the sera of children with seasonal allergic asthma was reported by Tiwari et al. They suggested correlations between miRNA expression and seasonal asthma symptoms: reduced let-7d-3p expression and increased asthma symptoms in the spring, and increased miR-328-3p expression and increased asthma symptoms in the autumn.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The indispensable position of an miRNA in the development and progression of allergic asthma was established based on theoretical and experimental evidence. However, more in-depth investigations of whether differentially expressed miRNAs are drivers or outcomes of allergic asthma are needed.</p><p>Here, we documented the diagnostic and therapeutic values of our selected differentially expressed miRNAs in children with allergic asthma by performing a literature review. A number of the top 50 differentially expressed miRNAs attracted our attention, including hsa-miR-487b-3p, hsa-miR-136-3p, hsa-miR-708-5p, hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-124, and hsa-miR-370-3p. According to previous reports, miR-487b-3p directly inhibits the expression of interleukin-33 (IL-33), a critical proinflammatory cytokine known to mediate allergic airway inflammation, but the finding that the expression levels of miR-487b-3p are similar between control mice and OVA-challenged wild-type mice is difficult to understand.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Our study may provide evidence that miR-487b-3p expression is reduced in the serum of patients with allergic asthma. In addition, the interest in the importance of miR-1248 in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma has been renewed. Panganiban et al<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> reported that miR-1248 expression is increased within PBMCs of patients with asthma, suggesting that miR-1248 is a positive regulator of IL-5 expression to exacerbate asthma by increasing Th2 cytokine levels. Similarly, miR-1248 has again attracted attention for its role in allergic asthma due to its significantly altered expression in our study. Notably, miR-370 was identified as a significantly upregulated miRNA in murine or cellular models of asthma, which alleviates asthma progression by inhibiting the FGF1/MAPK/STAT1 axis,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and the same expression trend was observed in our study. Meanwhile, miRNAs such as miR-150,<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> hsa-miR-381-3p,<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and hsa-miR-708-5p<xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> were also detected in studies of asthma or allergic asthma.</p><p>However, the value of differentially expressed miRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosing allergic asthma in children must be validated by conducting a large-sample study due to the limited number of subjects participating in the present study. Importantly, ceRNA is an important direction for studying the regulation of differentially expressed miRNAs. Undeniably, the mechanisms by which lncRNAs or circRNAs functioning as ceRNAs drive differentially expressed miRNAs to regulate chronic inflammation and airway hyperreactivity and whether DEM blockade might be of therapeutic value remain unclear, particularly in individuals with allergic asthma. Thus, more research is warranted to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms of differentially expressed miRNAs and ceRNAs associated with allergic asthma in children.

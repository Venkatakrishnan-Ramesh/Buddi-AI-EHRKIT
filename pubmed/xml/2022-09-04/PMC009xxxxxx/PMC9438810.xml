He was admitted with features of severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome. On the 6<sup>th</sup> day of his admission, his oxygen requirement increased to 15 L/min using a nonrebreathing facemask, and inflammatory markers such as serum ferritin 1100 mg/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 648 U/L, C-reactive protein (CRP): 77.34 mg/mL, and IL-6 215.7 pg/mL were raised. So, infusion of the first dose of IV itolizumab (1.6 mg/kg) 100 mg [Alzumab&#x02122; Biocon Ltd., Bangalore, India] was started. The patient was afebrile and his baseline parameters were heart rate (HR) 90 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 130/70 mm Hg, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) 91, and respiratory rate (RR) 34 rpm. Itolizumab 100 mg was diluted in 250 mL of 0.9% normal saline and infused at 25 mL/h for the first hour. After 10 min of the start of the infusion, we noticed mild shivering, and it was managed by applying warming blankets. After 2 hours of the start of the infusion, around 50 mL of the drug was given. The patient complained of a moderate grade of shivering with an increase in heart rate of 162 bpm, BP 145/95 mm Hg, and RR 44 rpm with rapid fall in oxygen saturation to 35% <xref rid="JOACP_675_20-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> [Panel A]. We immediately stopped the infusion and put this patient on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>): 100 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): 12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The flow-volume loop on ventilator graphics was suggestive of severe expiratory flow limitation <xref rid="JOACP_675_20-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> [Panel B], so we made a probable diagnosis of severe bronchospasm due to severe serious infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction following itolizumab infusion. However, the entire event lasted for more than 190 min, and then SpO<sub>2</sub> reached 97%, HR came to 116 bpm and BP 139/95 mm Hg, and RR was 41 rpm. <xref rid="JOACP_675_20-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> [Panel C] In clinical practice, mAbs infusion reactions have been observed to range from 12% to 15%.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] These reactions are most likely to occur during the first dosing cycle and tend to decrease in severity and frequency upon subsequent infusions. This case is believed to be the first life-threatening case of itolizumab-induced bronchospasm. There are various methods to decrease itolizumab infusion&#x02013;related reactions. They are (1) infusion should be given slowly in 5 to 6 h, (2) use premedication of hydrocortisone 100 mg i.v. and pheniramine 30 mg before the start of the infusion, (3) infusion set with an in-line filter with a pore size of 1.2 mm or less should be used, (4) drug desensitization to improve tolerance, and (5) switching to the subcutaneous (SC) route should be reconsidered. A written informed consent from the patient&#x02019;s relative was taken, and an adverse event reporting form was submitted.</p><fig position="float" id="JOACP_675_20-f001"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Panel A: Showing baseline vitals parameters and after 2 h of drug infusion (SpO<sub>2</sub> dropped from 91% to 35%).

Prolonged ventilation and difficulty in weaning warrants tracheostomy in these patients. However, tracheostomy is an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP) with a potential risk of viral exposure to healthcare workers during the procedure and post-tracheostomy care.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] There is significant controversy regarding the timing, location, and techniques of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients. Many societies recommend delayed and surgical tracheostomy to minimize aerosol generation.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] There is a paucity of evidence in the literature to clarify whether the indication and the type of tracheostomy (surgical versus percutaneous) in COVID-19 should be different from other critically ill patients.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The guidelines and protocols for the timing of tracheostomy vary across nations. European guidelines propose early tracheostomy,[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] whereas the British, North American, Singaporean, and South-African guidelines propose waiting for at least 14 days of ventilation or a COVID-19 negative test before tracheostomy.[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, all the recommendations are based on expert opinions and probable hypotheses, without any evidence.</p><p>However, in modern critical care practice, the benefits of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) cannot be overlooked.[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Early tracheotomy, defined as a procedure performed within 14 days from translaryngeal intubation, is associated with a significantly higher rate of tracheotomy but a larger number of ventilator-free days, shorter ICU stays, shorter duration of sedation, and lower long term mortality rates than late tracheotomy.[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In particular, PDT appears to be more cost-effective as it releases operating room resources and provides greater feasibility in terms of bedside capability than surgical tracheostomy.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Whereas certain institutes or units prefer to perform surgical tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients, the investigators of the current protocol believe that with certain modifications in the standard technique, PDT can be safely performed. Current investigators made an operational protocol and performed PDTs regularly in a designated COVID-19 ICU during the pandemic.</p><p>Although a series of safe and successful PDT in COVID-19 patients have been published recently,[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients who underwent PDT have not been widely reported in the literature. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed the case records of the patients who underwent PDT in our ICU. The objectives were to identify the patient characteristics, clinical outcome, timing of PDT, and procedure-related details.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>It was a retrospective cohort study.</p><p>All adult patients who underwent PDT in a designated COVID-19 ICU were included in the analysis.

The procedure was performed under real-time fibreoptic bronchoscopic guidance by Ciaglia Blue Rhino&#x000ae; Advanced Percutaneous Tracheostomy Introducer Sets. The median duration of tracheostomy was 5 (4&#x02013;7) min, and desaturation below 90% was noticed in 48.8% of patients. Tracheal puncture was performed in the first attempt in 67.5% of patients and in the second attempt in 24.4% of patients. The posterior wall of the trachea and guidewire were visible by fibreoptic bronchoscopy in all patients. False passage of guidewire was noted in one patient, and no other mechanical complications such as posterior wall puncture, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum were noted. In this cohort, 41.5% (95% CI: 27.8&#x02013;56.3) patients survived to ICU discharge. The Median (IQR) duration of ICU stay was 17 (14&#x02013;21) days, and the median duration from tracheostomy to first spontaneous breathing trial to T piece (SBT) was 4 (3&#x02013;5) days among survivors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As per World Health Organization (WHO), severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by SpO2 &#x0003c;90% and a respiratory rate of &#x0003e;30/min, while critically ill patients have added complications such as ARDS, sepsis, septic shock, or thrombosis.[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In our study, nearly all the patients were severe or critically ill at presentation, and the majority of the patients required intubation within 1 day. Early PDT performed in less than 12 days in COVID-19 has shown to reduce the requirement of PEEP and FiO2, need for sedation causing prompt awakening and improved mobility, ventilator days, and ICU length of stay.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This, in turn, may enhance the availability of ICU beds, which becomes crucial in the midst of a pandemic and resource shortage. In our study, PDT was considered in daily clinical rounds from day 7 of mechanical ventilation if the patient continued to require control mode ventilation with PEEP &#x0003e;8 cm H2O and FiO2 &#x0003e;0.5. The median duration of mechanical ventilation on the day of PDT was 10 days, and 41.5% of the patients finally survived to ICU discharge. Another large series of 270 COVID-19 patients suggest similar timing of PDT (mean: 10.6 days).[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] However, most of the patients were still critical on control mode ventilation on the day of PDT (compliance: 26 mL/cm H2O and PaO2/FiO2: 155 mm Hg) and thus required a median of 4 days to undergo first T piece trial after PDT.</p><p>Though early PDT has been shown to have beneficial outcomes in the weaning process, it is recognized as an aerosol-generating procedure with the risk of viral infection to health care professionals.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Aerosolization of secretions can be minimized by executing the procedure under intentional and controlled apneic conditions with muscle paralysis.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Pre-procedure USG scanning of the neck helps in identifying pre-tracheal vessels and has the potential to reduce complications.[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] As per our protocol, we used both apnea and pre-procedure USG scanning for all patients. Apnea during the procedure was carried out by switching the ventilator to standby mode before and during any disconnection or deflation of the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff. The average duration of PDT was only 5 min. Despite this, nearly half of the patients had SpO2 &#x0003c;90% with the lowest SpO2 record of 85%, which reflects the severity of the disease in our cohort. However, all the desaturation episodes were transient with rapid recovery of oxygenation. Although all the procedures were performed under bronchoscopic guidance, one patient had a false passage. However, it was promptly detected and trans-laryngeal intubation was performed. Subsequently, PDT was done at a later setting.</p><p>We did not repeat RT-PCR for the patients before the procedure, and the evidence show that repeat RT-PCR testing and waiting for the patient to turn RT-PCR negative is not necessary.[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This appears to be a reasonable approach as none of the health care professionals performing the PDT developed symptomatic COVID-19, although asymptomatic spread cannot be ruled out. A new PDT set was used every time and no part was reused. USG probes were covered with disposable drapes and transparent dressing and were disinfected with low-level disinfectants such as soap water after every use, and the bronchoscope was disinfected with glutaraldehyde solution after every use.[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Retrospective nature was the main limitation of the study. Therefore, details of various parameters such as post-tracheostomy sedation requirement and ventilator weaning could not be documented.</p><p>To conclude, this descriptive study demonstrates the feasibility, implementation, and apparent safety of the PDT protocol developed at our institution.</p><sec><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author">

This effect cannot be explained by the known inhibitory activity of PA against 5- and 12-lipoxygenases. The aim was therefore to search for mechanisms for the anti-proliferative activity of PA. Two cancer cell lines of different origin, both sensitive to anti-proliferative effects of PA, were selected for this study, T-47D from breast cancer and AsPC-1 from pancreatic cancer. Morphological changes were assessed by transmission electron microscopy, HPLC coupled with TOF spectrometry was used for metabolomics, mitochondrial function was measured using the Agilent Seahorse XFp Real-time ATP assay and glucose/lactate levels by radiometry. Levels of glutathione, NADP/NADPH and reactive oxygen species [ROS] were measured by luminescence. Following exposure to PA both cell lines showed structural changes in mitochondria that were in line with
a measured reduction in oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolysis. These changes were more marked in T-47D, which had poorer mitochondrial function at baseline. PA was processed and expelled from the cells via the mercapturic pathway, which consumes glutathione. Nevertheless, glutathione levels were increased after 24 hours of exposure to PA, implying enhanced synthesis. Redox balance was not much affected and ROS levels were not increased. We conclude that PA is metabolically processed and expelled from cells, leading indirectly to increased glutathione levels with minimal effects on redox balance. The most marked effect was on mitochondrial structure and metabolic function implying that effects of PA may depend on mitochondrial fitness.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Protolichesterinic acid</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd><italic>Cetraria islandica</italic></kwd><kwd>Parmeliaceae</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>University of Iceland Research Fund</funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>
New drugs can be developed by one of two main approaches; by synthesizing tailor-made compounds to fit a proposed drug target or by screening existing compounds for a desired activity. In the latter case, the mode of action is often unknown. The aliphatic

<xref rid="RF0251-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
. PA was previously known to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase
<xref rid="RF0251-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
and subsequently shown to also inhibit 12-lipoxygenase
<xref rid="RF0251-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
. At that time, it had been
proposed that 5- and 12-lipoxygenases (LOX) promoted carcinogenesis and cancer progression
<xref rid="RF0251-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
. We found that PA could indeed inhibit the activity of 5- and 12 LOX in cancer cells but this required concentrations that were much higher than those needed for anti-proliferative effects. This implies that the anti-proliferative activity of PA is not mediated by inhibition of 5- and 12 LOX
<xref rid="RF0251-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
. The structural similarity between PA and C75, a known inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (FASN) suggested another possible mode of action. Our results indicated that PA affects FASN activity in breast cancer cells that overexpress this enzyme, but not in another breast cancer cell line that does not overexpress FASN
<xref rid="RF0251-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
. Furthermore, PA affected signalling through the ERK 1/2 and AKT pathways, but these effects were context-dependent and secondary

Having thus failed to identify a basic effect of PA on cells we were prompted to search for other mechanisms and effects on cellular function. PA was shown in a screening study several years ago to have inhibitory activity against HIV reverse transcriptase
<xref rid="RF0251-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
. One frequently reported off-target effect of HIV RT inhibitors is mitochondrial toxicity, mediated by inhibition of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase &#x003b3;
<xref rid="RF0251-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
. In addition, our preliminary transmission electron-microscopic studies had suggested that PA might induce morphological changes in mitochondria. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to explore the effects of PA on mitochondrial structure and function, using a combined approach of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), mass spectrometry, and specific tests for effects on energy metabolism, radical oxygen species (ROS) and redox status.

Two cell lines were selected for the current study based on previous results. Both are sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of PA with almost the same IC

, but there were indications that they responded differently, as AsPC-1 showed less reduction in the S-phase fraction of the cell cycle. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the two cell types had different mitochondrial morphologies in cells treated with solvent control (see
<xref rid="FIF0251-2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x02009;2</xref>
). In AsPC-1, most mitochondria were long and slender, whereas they were short and broad in T-47D. PA induced changes in both cell lines. After exposure of T-47D to PA mitochondria appeared shorter and swollen, many had lost their inner structure, and cristae were fragmented. The effect of
PA on AsPC-1 was less marked, but in PA-treated cells short and broad mitochondria were clearly more prominent than in cells exposed only to solvent.

Having observed morphological changes in mitochondria upon treatment with PA we tested for effects on energy metabolism. Measurements of glucose uptake and lactate secretion in spent medium after 24 hours was indicative of lowered glycolytic rate, although these changes were not statistically significant (Supplementary
<bold>Fig.&#x02009;1S</bold>
). To enhance the sensitivity of measurements and more accurately determine changes in metabolic rate, we performed metabolic flux analysis using the Seahorse technology (
<xref rid="FIF0251-3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x02009;3</xref>
). When cells were exposed to PA for 24 hours before the analysis, a clear effect was observed in both cell lines with reduced oxygen consumption and increased acidification. Comparison of untreated controls indicates that oxidative phosphorylation was already lower, and acid-producing glycolysis higher in T-47D than AsPC-1, shown by the less marked effect of adding oligomycin (uncoupling ATP production from oxygen uptake). When response was
monitored during addition of PA the presence of PA appeared to interfere with the action oligomycin (
<xref rid="FIF0251-3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x02009;3&#x0200a;c,&#x0200a;g</xref>
). Nevertheless, rapid acidification occurred in T-47D, but not AsPC-1, which might imply already poorer mitochondrial function in T-47D and therefore greater sensitivity (
<xref rid="FIF0251-3" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x02009;3&#x0200a;d,&#x0200a;h</xref>
). The differences observed in pre-treated vs. titrated response suggest that PA has not fully imparted its metabolic effect within the 100-minute timeframe of the seahorse titration assay.

To search for general metabolic effects of PA, a metabolomic screen of intracellular metabolites following PA treatment was performed. The results revealed that PA itself is processed through the mercapturic pathway, yielding glutathione conjugates that are further metabolized into cystenyl-glycine conjugates and finally cysteine conjugates (
<xref rid="FIF0251-4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x02009;4</xref>
). The same compounds were detected in the extracellular media indicating their excretion from the cell (Supplementary

At the same time, the total levels of glutathione were elevated in both cell lines, implying enhanced synthesis; see
<xref rid="FIF0251-4" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x02009;4</xref>
. The measured increase in levels of oxidized glutathione was less marked and not significant. Other significant metabolic changes detected in the screen were a decrease in glutamate levels and increased levels of proline. These two changes are linked, since proline can be derived from glutamate in a biosynthetic process requiring NAD[P]H

. Minor changes were observed in choline lipids, 20&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;50% increase in levels of lysophspatidyl choline, and 10&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;60% increase in carnitine. These changes were greater in T-47D and could be related to cell death, which was more marked in this cell line (Supplementary
<bold>Fig.&#x02009;3S</bold>
).
</p><p>
Having found that glutathione is utilized in metabolic processing of PA, we sought to confirm how PA affected redox balance. The effect on glutathione levels was investigated further at different time points, using an enzymatic assay. The significant increase in total glutathione levels was confirmed in both cell lines after 24 hours of exposure (42% and 57% in AsPC-1 and T-47D. respectively), and the effect was already evident in AsPC-1 after 6 hours (37%). Levels of oxidized glutathione were not affected after 6 hours but elevated in both cell lines after 24 hours (31% and 28% in AsPC-1 and T-47D. respectively) (

The increased levels of glutathione were reflected in reduced levels of NADPH (to approximately 80% in both cell lines at 6 and 24&#x02009;h;
<xref rid="FIF0251-5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x02009;5</xref>
), which is required for reduction of oxidized glutathione to regenerate the reduced form. The levels of NADP+ were also reduced and therefore the ratio NADPH/NADP+ was not significantly altered.
</p><p>
PA did not induce a rise in reactive oxygen species (ROS). A small but significant reduction was observed in AsPC-1 after 24&#x000a0;hours when a marked response was seen in the positive control with menadione (Supplementary
<bold>Fig.&#x02009;4S</bold>
). Taken together, the results confirm changes to glutathione but the overall redox balance appeared not to be much affected.
</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study has revealed how protolichesterinic acid is metabolically processed and conjugated through the mercapturic pathway. The only other significant finding from the metabolic screen was increased production of proline from glutamate. The consumption of glutathione in the conjugation stimulated synthesis of glutathione, resulting in significantly raised levels. Redox balance was not much affected, and ROS levels were not increased. These findings were the same in both cell lines tested. The two cell lines showed different mitochondrial morphology and function at base line and also differed in the effects observed on mitochondria and energy metabolism following exposure to PA, with T-47D having poorer mitochondrial function at baseline and showing more markedly reduced function in response to PA. Taken together, PA therefore seems to have two main effects on cellular metabolism. Glutathione levels are increased following conjugation that expels PA from the cell. The
overall effect on redox balance is minimal. Mitochondrial structure and function are affected, with a reduction in oxidative phosphorylation and increased glycolysis with reduced flux through the TCA cycle, directing glutamate to alternative pathways.</p><p>
The chemical structure of PA makes it a candidate for metabolic processing by conjugation to glutathione by Michael addition
<xref rid="RF0251-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
. Following the first step of conjugation with glutathione, further processing takes place extracellularly. The compound is thus inactivated and expelled from the cell. As the conjugation consumes glutathione, it might be expected that its levels would decline. This was indeed the case in the study of Punganuru et al. on goniothalamin
<xref rid="RF0251-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
that is processed in the same way. In contrast, our study showed increased levels of glutathione in PA-treated cells, indicating stimulated synthesis. The biosynthesis of glutathione subunits is regulated by the transcription factor Nrf2
<xref rid="RF0251-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
. Interestingly, derivatives of PA have been reported to activate Nrf2
<xref rid="RF0251-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
.
</p><p>
Despite the redox balance (i.e., ratios of NADPH/NADP+ and GSH/GSSG and ROS levels) being relatively unaffected and consistent with the findings of Brisdelli et al.
<xref rid="RF0251-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
, a clear increase in intracellular glutamate and proline was observed following PA treatment. Proline is generated from glutamate in enzymatically catalysed reactions that are dependent upon NADPH. As the NADPH levels were lowered, although redox balance was relatively unaffected, this indicates that a change in glutamate levels drives the increase in intracellular proline. Thus, our data imply that enhanced GSH synthesis could lead to enhanced flux via the GSH synthesis pathway, thus resulting in increased glutamate levels and proline overflow. Indeed, the mercapturic pathway stimulates enhanced GSH synthesis via Nrf2
<xref rid="RF0251-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
transcriptional activation of glutamate cysteine ligase, the rate limiting enzyme of GSH synthesis. The increase in GSH/glutamate
and proline might therefore be explained via Nrf2 activation. Quantitatively, however, given shutdown of oxidative phosphorylation after 24&#x02009;h, reduced flux within the TCA cycle and a build-up of TCA cycle intermediates and their precursors (i.e., glutamate) is a more likely explanation of increased levels of glutamate rather than enhanced GSH synthesis per se. Glutamate is then directed to other pathways including GSH and proline synthesis. Albeit consistent with current understanding of the mechanism of anaplerotic fuelling of the TCA cycle, a more detailed flux analysis incorporating isotopically labelled nutrient precursors would be required to confirm these flux hypotheses. Nevertheless, considering the seahorse flux analysis, 24&#x02009;h treatment of PA clearly results in a shutdown of oxidative phosphorylation.

<xref rid="RF0251-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
. Altered mitochondrial function can drive tumor growth, mitochondria may be affected by oncogenic mutations, and they respond to metabolic stress. Mitochondria are therefore considered potential targets for cancer therapy

. Mitochondrial function and glucose metabolism vary between cancer types, as shown by differences in uptake of labelled glucose in PET scanning

,&#x0200a;
<xref rid="RF0251-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
. Long, slender mitochondria are associated with a high rate of oxidative phosphorylation, but shorter mitochondria have been linked to reduced rate
<xref rid="RF0251-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
. Damage to the inner
membrane structure leads to failure of oxidative phosphorylation and reduced flux through the TCA cycle. The morphological differences observed between the two cell lines and PA-treated vs. control cells are therefore in line with the observed metabolic changes. Thus, T-47D had shorter mitochondria than AsPC-1 at baseline and lower rate of oxidative phosphorylation and following exposure to PA both cell lines showed morphological changes that are associated with the measured decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and reduced flux through the TCA cycle.

. The current study shows how PA is metabolically processed and expelled from the cell and indicates that the final cellular response to PA depends on the metabolic state and mitochondrial function of the cell. The ability of PA to inhibit proliferation of several different types of cancer cells makes it a promising candidate for further drug development. Such further studies should take into consideration that the response will be context-dependent and that cancer cells with reduced mitochondrial respiration might be particularly susceptible.

Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATTC) through LGC Promochem. AsPC-1 (pancreatic carcinoma cell line) and T-47D (breast ductal carcinoma cell line) were grown adherent. Both cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 tissue culture medium (GIBCO), containing penicillin (50&#x02009;IU/mL) and streptomycin (50&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL) (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured with fetal bovine serum ([FBS, GIBCOTM) to a final concentration of 10%, and T-47D cells with an addition of 0.01&#x02009;mg/mL insulin (Sigma).

The medium was removed, and cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde (Ted Pella, Inc.) in 0.1&#x02009;M Cacodylate buffer (pH&#x02009;7.4, J.&#x0200a;B. EM Services Inc.) for 20 minutes. The fixative was removed, and cells washed in 0.1&#x02009;M Cacodylate buffer twice for 3 minutes. Coverslips were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (J.&#x0200a;B. EM Services Inc.) in 0.1&#x02009;M Cacodylate buffer for 1&#x000a0;hour, followed by two 3-minute washes with 0.1&#x02009;M Cacodylate buffer. Cells were dehydrated in a series of ethanol: once with 70% ethanol (Gamla Ap&#x000f3;teki&#x000f0;) for 1 minute, once with 96% ethanol for 1 minute and twice with absolute ethanol for 1 minute. Each coverslip was then dipped in acetone for a few seconds and placed on an aluminium dish (Sigma-Aldrich). A drop of resin (Spurr Resin &#x02013; Ted
Pella, Inc.) was immediately poured on top of the coverslip to cover the cells. A gelatin capsule was filled with resin and inverted on top of the cells to create a block. Samples were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature to allow the resin to infiltrate into the cells. Blocks were then transferred to a 70&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C oven and baked overnight. After cooling, resin blocks were separated from coverslips by dipping them for few seconds into liquid nitrogen. Blocks were trimmed with trimming tool (Leica EM Trim 2) and ultra-thin (100&#x02009;nm) sections cut with a diamond knife (45&#x000b0; Diatome) on an Ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC7) and placed on copper grids (Ted Pella, Inc.). Sections on grids were imaged using a JEM-1400PLUS PL Transmission Electron Microscope.

Cells were treated with 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL PA and appropriate controls for 24 hours. Supernatant media were collected, and the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Thirty microliters of an isotopically labelled internal standard mixture were added to each well, followed by 1&#x02009;mL of ice-cold 80% methanol. The cells were dislodged with a cell scraper, and the cell extracts were collected into Eppendorf tubes. An additional 0.5&#x02009;mL of 80% methanol was added to each well, and the resulting solutions, with any remaining cell debris, were combined with the previous extracts. The cell extracts were centrifuged (20&#x0200a;817&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;g, 4&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C) for 15 minutes to separate the supernatant from the precipitate.

Intra- and extracellular samples were analysed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography [HILIC] coupled with time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (Synapt G2, Waters, UK) using a previously described method
<xref rid="RF0251-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
. Each sample was measured both in positive and negative ionization mode. The mass spectrometer (MS) was operated using a capillary voltage of 1.5&#x02009;kV, sampling cone voltage of 30&#x02009;V, and extraction cone voltage of 4&#x02009;V. The chromatographic separation was achieved by using an Acquity BEH amide 1.7&#x02009;&#x000b5;m column (2.1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150&#x02009;mm; Waters), a flow rate of 0.4&#x02009;mL/min, column temperature of 45&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C, and an injection volume of 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;L. Mobile phase A consisted of ACN containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of H

O containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The following elution gradient was used: 0&#x000a0;minutes 99% A, 6 minutes 40% A, 8 minutes 60% A, 8.5 minutes 99% A, and 14 minutes 99% A. Quadrupole-TOF tandem mass
spectrometry was used to analyze selected ions in both positive and negative ionization modes using the same chromatographic conditions and mass spectrometer configurations described above. The raw data files were converted to netCDF files using the software Databridge 1.0 (Waters, UK). The R package XCMS
<xref rid="RF0251-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
was used for automated feature detection and retention time alignment using the Centwave and Obiwrap algorithms, respectively. Metabolites were annotated by comparing m/z and retention times to an in-house library. The identified metabolites were normalized by dividing the chromatographic peak area of each metabolite with the peak area of a proper internal standard.

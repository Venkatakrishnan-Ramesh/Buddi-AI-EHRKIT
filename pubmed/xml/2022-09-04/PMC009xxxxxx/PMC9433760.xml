Despite their similar socioeconomic statuses, Hong Kong SAR, China encountered a higher case fatality ratio (CFR) accompanied by an overwhelmed medical system compared to Singapore. This study collected and compared the CFRs, vaccination coverage, infection rate, and medical resources occupancy rates from the two places. The vaccine coverage rates and CFRs in 52 Omicron variant dominated countries and regions were also collected and multiple linear regressions were used to explore associations. The random forest (RF) method was additionally used to estimate the importance of factors contributing to CFRs. The CFR in Hong Kong SAR, China was larger than in Singapore (0.53% <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 0.06%), especially for people &#x02265;70 years (4.46% <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 0.48%). Correspondingly, the vaccine coverage was lower in Hong Kong SAR, China than in Singapore (full vaccine coverage for total population: 76.15% <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 92.00%; for people &#x02265;70 years: 56.82% <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 95.00%). Based on the data from Omicron variant dominated countries and regions, a negative association between vaccine coverage and CFR was observed. The RF model indicated that full vaccination and &#x02265;1 dose vaccination coverages were the top two contributing factors to CFR. These findings call on people without complete coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations, especially the elderly, to get any type of accessible vaccine, which could save lives.</p><p>Since the emergence of Omicron variant, due to its heightened transmissibility, the whole world has been suffering a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). As finance and trade centers with high international connectivity, Hong Kong SAR, China and Singapore have been experiencing a considerable increase in COVID-19 cases since January 2022. According to the Government of Hong Kong SAR, China, the epidemic was overwhelming the medical system with a relatively high CFR (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), while Singapore seemed to manage its epidemic within the capacity of its medical system contributing to a lower CFR (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). As we know, Hong Kong SAR, China and Singapore share many similar characteristics, such as developed economy, freeport international trade, and a similar population density. However, it is unclear why there is such a stark difference in CFR between the two locations. This study aims to explore this important issue, which could provide significant implications for China to develop and adjust future COVID-19 prevention strategies.</p><p>Hong Kong SAR, China had been applying the zero-COVID policy using strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as border quarantine, social distancing, and mask wearing, and achieved low cases during the first four waves of epidemic. Unfortunately, several infected flight staff did not obey the quarantine rule and entered the community, which was the suspected origin of the Omicron variant epidemic in Hong Kong SAR, China. Because of the superior transmissibility of Omicron variant, the delayed identification, and the control of all infected people, the epidemic rapidly expanded. Together with low vaccination coverage among the elderly, the imperfect tiered diagnosis, and treatment strategy at the early stage, more severe cases may occur and a few patients with mild symptoms may occupy the hospital beds, which lead to overwhelmed medical systems.</p><p>Since the emergence of the first case of COVID-19 in January 2020 in Singapore, its containment strategy had been applied until August 2021, when 78% of its population had been vaccinated with at least one dose. Since then, Singapore has continued to promote COVID-19 vaccination and tried to transition to &#x0201c;co-existence with virus&#x0201d; strategy by gradually lifting NPI restrictions. Singapore has also been optimizing the tiered diagnosis and treatment strategy, which effectively relieved the pressures on the medical system.</p><p>CFRs, vaccination coverage, infection rate, medical resources occupancy rates for COVID-19, and other comparative variables, including age structure, the number of swab tests, and prevalence of chronic diseases were obtained and calculated from the Government of the Hong Kong SAR, China and Singapore. The detailed source websites were presented in the footnotes of tables and figures.</p><p>To investigate the effects of vaccination coverage after controlling for confounding factors, we collected the data of 52 Omicron dominated countries and regions (Omicron proportion &#x02265;90%) from Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/). Nine explanatory variables, including full vaccination, &#x02265;1 dose, booster vaccination, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, population density, hospital beds per 1,000 people, human development index, proportion of people aged 70 and older, and cardiovascular mortality per 100,000 people were collected. One dependent variable (CFR) was collected. The detailed definitions of these variables are presented in <ext-link xlink:href="SupplementaryTableS1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link> (available in <ext-link xlink:href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn" ext-link-type="uri">http://weekly.chinacdc.cn</ext-link>). Due to the 28-day efficacy assessment period (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), the proportion of people with at least one dose, with full vaccination, with booster vaccination before February 7, 2022 were collected and then averaged for analysis.</p><p>Multiple linear regression models were employed to explore the effects of vaccination coverage (full vaccination, &#x02265;1 dose, and booster vaccination) on CFR separately, after controlling for potential confounding variables. In addition, a random forest (RF) regression model was used to qualitatively assess the feature importance of nine explanatory variables contributing to CFR. RF regression analysis, a tree-based machine learning algorithm, works well with multicollinearity and nonlinear problems between predictors and makes decisions by constructing a multitude of decision trees (5,000 trees in this study) for training the data included in a model (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Predictions for each variable are aggregated across all trees and percentage increase in mean square error (%IncMSE) is calculated, which indicates how much the model accuracy decreases if that variable is omitted.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.0.5, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A two-sided <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 represented statistically significant.</p><p><xref rid="Table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that from December 31, 2021 to March 22, 2022, the CFR of COVID-19 in Hong Kong SAR, China (0.58%; age standardization: 0.53%) was much larger than in Singapore (0.05%; age standardization: 0.06%). The CFRs increased with the rise of age in both Hong Kong SAR, China and Singapore, and in most age groups, CFRs were higher in Hong Kong SAR, China than in Singapore, especially for people &#x02265;70 years.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="Table1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>The comparison of CFR and vaccination coverage in Hong Kong SAR, China and Singapore, by age group &#x02014; December 31, 2021 to March 22, 2022.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="3" align="center" valign="middle" colspan="1">

52 Omicron variant dominated countries/regions and conducted multiple linear regressions. After adjusting for GDP per capita, proportion of people aged 70 and older, population density, hospital beds per 1,000 people, human development index, and cardiovascular mortality per 100,000 people, we found that a higher coverage of &#x02265;1 dose vaccination, full vaccination, and booster vaccination was all negatively associated with lower CFRs (<ext-link xlink:href="SupplementaryTableS2" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table S2</ext-link>, available in <ext-link xlink:href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn" ext-link-type="uri">http://weekly.chinacdc.cn</ext-link>). Moreover, full vaccination and &#x02265;1 dose vaccination coverages were the top two contributing factors to CFR (<xref rid="Figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="Figure1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The importance rank of contribution variables to CFR using a RF model.</p></caption><abstract abstract-type="note"><p>Note: Full vaccination refers to people who received all doses prescribed by the initial vaccination protocol (commonly 2 doses and sometimes 3 doses, depending on the definition by the corresponding countries) per 100 people in the total population of the country or region; &#x02265;1 dose refers to people who received at least 1 dose vaccination per 100 people in the total population of the country or region. </p><p>Booster vaccination refers to people with doses administered beyond the number prescribed by the initial vaccination protocol (commonly 3 doses and sometimes 4 doses, depending on the definition by the corresponding countries or regions) per 100 people in the total population of the country or region. </p><p>The detailed information of other variables is presented in <ext-link xlink:href="SupplementaryTableS1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table S1</ext-link> (available in <ext-link xlink:href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn" ext-link-type="uri">http://weekly.chinacdc.cn</ext-link>). </p><p>Abbreviation: CFR=case fatality ratio; RF=random forest regression model; %IncMSE=percentage increase in mean square error.</p></abstract><graphic xlink:href="ccdcw-4-30-649-1" position="float"/></fig><sec id="s01"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The CFR in Hong Kong SAR, China during the 5th wave of COVID-19 is much higher than in Singapore, which could be attributed to the relatively low vaccination coverage, especially in elderly populations in Hong Kong SAR, China.</p><p>A systematic review indicated that age was the strongest predictor of infection&#x02013;fatality ratio (IFR) during the pre-vaccine period (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The age-specific IFR during the pre-vaccine period formed a J shape. A series of reasons, like immunosenescence, underlying diseases, and age-related damage could explain the higher IFR in the elderly (<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Fortunately, vaccination, especially booster vaccination, has been proved effective in reducing COVID-19 related deaths for the elderly (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). We also observed that the CFRs in fully vaccinated and booster vaccinated people were lower than in non-fully vaccinated people in Hong Kong SAR, China and Singapore. This difference should also be interpreted with the consideration of the &#x0201c;healthy vaccinee effect.&#x0201d; That is people with better health conditions are more likely to adhere to recommended vaccination, which may underestimate the CFR of vaccinated people.</p><p>In this study, after adjusting for confounding variables in the countries with a proportion of Omicron variant more than 90%, we also observed that &#x02265;1 dose, full vaccination, and booster vaccination were all effective at reducing CFR. Unexpectedly, the effect and the importance of boosters were lower than the other two vaccination statuses, which may be explained by the low booster vaccine coverage in elderly populations. After the initial booster vaccination, young people could have lower vaccination hesitancy than the older adults and comprise a larger proportion of people vaccinated with a booster dose. Together with the lower mortality risk of young people, the real effect of booster vaccine coverage (normally higher than the coverage of full vaccination) will not emerge until more people, especially older adults, receive booster vaccines. In addition, a large observational study in Hong Kong SAR, China indicated that receiving two doses of mRNA vaccine (vaccine effectiveness: 89.3%) and inactivated vaccine (vaccine effectiveness: 69.9%) could all achieve good effectiveness against COVID-19 related severe diseases and deaths in the elderly (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). This study also indicated that receiving three doses of both mRNA and inactivated vaccine could offer superior effectiveness than two doses (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The real-world evidence in Hong Kong SAR, China indicates that the elderly should get any type of accessible vaccine whenever possible.</p><p>Outside of vaccination status, the following factors may contribute to a higher CFR in Hong Kong SAR, China than in Singapore. First, Hong Kong SAR, China has a higher proportion of people aged 70 and older (12.10%) than Singapore (7.30%) (<ext-link xlink:href="SupplementaryFigureS1" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>, available in <ext-link xlink:href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn" ext-link-type="uri">http://weekly.chinacdc.cn</ext-link>). Second, the prevalence of chronic diseases in Hong Kong SAR, China is higher than in Singapore (<ext-link xlink:href="SupplementaryTableS3" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>, available in <ext-link xlink:href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn" ext-link-type="uri">http://weekly.chinacdc.cn</ext-link>). The prevalence of obesity is 29.9% in Hong Kong SAR, China and only 8.7% in Singapore. The prevalence of hyperlipidaemia and hypertension is also higher in Hong Kong SAR, China than in Singapore (hyperlipidaemia: 49.5% <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 33.6%, hypertension: 27.7% <italic toggle="yes">vs.</italic> 21.5%). Third, in Singapore, a total of 279,450 cases of COVID-19 have been reported as of December 31, 2021. On the contrary, Hong Kong SAR, China has only 12,649 reported cases before 2022, which makes the infection rate in Hong Kong SAR, China (0.20%) before 2022 lower than that in Singapore (4.80%). Fourth, the number of COVID-19 infections was higher in Singapore than in Hong Kong SAR, China before late February, but the proportion of hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients was higher in Hong Kong SAR, China than in Singapore since mid-February (<ext-link xlink:href="SupplementaryFigureS2" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure S2</ext-link>, available in <ext-link xlink:href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn" ext-link-type="uri">http://weekly.chinacdc.cn</ext-link>), which could be attributed to the imperfect tiered diagnosis and treatment strategy during the early Omicron epidemic in Hong Kong SAR, China. A few patients without severe symptoms occupied hospital beds, which led to an overwhelmed medical system unable to treat patients with severe illness and contributed to a higher CFR. Finally, the average daily number of swab tests (including polymerase chain reaction and rapid antigen test) of COVID-19 in Hong Kong SAR, China was 22.5 tests per 1,000 people (January to March 2022), while in Singapore it was 37.8 tests per 1,000 people (December 31, 2021 to March 14, 2022) (<ext-link xlink:href="SupplementaryTableS4" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Table S4</ext-link>, available in <ext-link xlink:href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn" ext-link-type="uri">http://weekly.chinacdc.cn</ext-link>). In conclusion, this comparison between Hong Kong SAR, China and Singapore indicates that vaccination has had good efficacy in preventing deaths from COVID-19. This real-world evidence calls on non-vaccinated, non-fully-vaccinated and non-booster-vaccinated people, especially the elderly, to get any type of accessible vaccine, which could save lives.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><note><p>Ritchie H, Mathieu E, Rod&#x000e9;s-Guirao L, Appel C, Giattino C, Ortiz-Ospina E, et al.

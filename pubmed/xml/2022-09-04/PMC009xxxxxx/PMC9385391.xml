The Baerveldt implant (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA) consists of a silicone tube connected to a flexible barium impregnated 250 mm<sup>2</sup> or 350 mm silicone end-plate.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> These non-valved implants require a temporary restriction of aqueous flow by internal and/or external tube ligation until encapsulation around the end plate has occurred. This maneuver reduces the risk of early postoperative hypotony. The internal ligation suture can then be removed in order to achieve target intraocular pressure (IOP).</p><p>The use of a 3-0 or 5-0 nylon braided Supramid (S. Jackson Inc., Alexandria, VA, USA) inserted in the tube's lumen with or without external ligation has been described to effectively control the IOP.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> There is a lack of knowledge regarding the time to internal ligation suture removal following Baerveldt tube (BVT) implantation and the postoperative effect on IOP.</p><p>This paper presents the 12-months outcomes following the removal of 3-0 Supramid internal ligation suture from a series of patients following 350 mm<sup>2</sup> BVT surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>M<sc>aterials and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><p>This study was a prospective, consecutive, non-comparative case series. Data was collected at the Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. Formal ethics approval was not needed, although this study adheres to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and local clinical governance approval for data collection was obtained.</p><p>The series included 24 eyes of 24 consecutive glaucoma patients in whom a 350 mm<sup>2</sup> BVT (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA) had been implanted over a period of 4 years between March 2014 and July 2018.</p><p>All tubes were checked for patency by injecting basic saline solution (BSS) through a Rycroft cannula at the plate's insertion of the tube. Patency was confirmed when BSS was observed at the other end of the tube. All tubes were internally ligated using a 3-0 Supramid (S. Jackson Inc., Alexandria, VA, USA) suture. The internal ligation occupied approximately 50% of the tube's length and the portion outside the tube's end plate was appropriately trimmed and sutured to the sclera approximately 1 cm away from the silicone tube using 10-0 nylon suture. Additionally, an external 10-0 nylon ligation suture was placed around the tube, 1&#x02013;2 mm from the end plate to temporarily stop aqueous outflow onto the endplate. A 2 mm relieving or venting incision (Sherwood slit) was performed with a 20G corneal/scleral knife 1.3 mm V-Lance (Alcon Laboratories Inc., Geneva, Switzerland) 1 mm anterior to external ligation suture to control the initial postoperative IOP. All the tubes were then covered with a human sclera donor patch graft.</p><p>Postoperatively, if the IOP was deemed clinically suboptimal the argon-laser suture lysis of the external ligation suture was performed at week 3 or 4, when the Sherwood slit had closed. This was performed with Pascal 532nm photocoagulator green argon laser (Topcon Corp., Tokyo 174-8580, Japan) and Blumenthal suture lysis lens (Volk Optical Inc., 7893 Enterprise Drive, Mentor, United States). The setting used were 200 mW &#x000d7; 0.1 seconds and 100 &#x003bc;m laser spot's diameter.</p><p>The internal 3-0 Supramid suture was removed in the operating theater when the IOP was considered clinically suboptimal, but not for at least 4 weeks following BVT surgery in order to allow end-plate encapsulation. All procedures were performed by either the consultant ophthalmic surgeon (PA) or the senior glaucoma fellow. After topical anesthesia with tetracaine hydrochloride 1% and local antisepsis with povidone iodine 5%, the conjunctiva was dissected down to sclera besides the Supramid and the suture exposed. The suture was then pulled out of the tube while checking for any signs of intraoperative hypotony (i.e., anterior chamber shallowing and/or eyeball softening) or extrusion of the tip of the silicone tube from the anterior chamber. The conjunctival wound was then sutured with a 10-0 nylon suture. Postoperative G. Chloramphenicol 1% minims QDS was administered for 7 days and all glaucoma medication was stopped. At each postoperative clinic visit, glaucoma medications were potentially reintroduced according to the IOP.</p><p>Data collection included patient age, gender, glaucoma diagnosis and IOP, and number of glaucoma medications before 3-0 Supramid removal. Following stent removal, the IOP and number of medications were collected at each follow-up visit including day 1 and months 1, 3, 6, and 12. Patients who failed to attend follow-up visit in the reporting windows proposed by the World Glaucoma Association (WGA) Guidelines were excluded from this study.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>The primary outcome measures were IOP reduction and the number of glaucoma medications at 12 months postoperatively.

Valved GDDs, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV), have a theoretical advantage of restricting aqueous outflow thus minimizing hypotony. It consists of two silicone membranes that close below an IOP of 8&#x02013;10 mm Hg, thus regulating aqueous outflow. However, non-valved GDDs, and in particular the BVT, have been shown to be more effective in lowering IOP compared to the AGV but with a higher rate of postoperative hypotony.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> These non-valved GDDs rely on fibrovascular encapsulation of the end plate to provide enough resistance to aqueous outflow in order to prevent hypotony. Encapsulation can take 4&#x02013;6 weeks to develop and hence in the interim, flow restriction with either an internal ligation suture or external ligation suture, or both is required.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>On the contrary, ensuring an early postoperative outflow rate in the normal intraocular pressure range can be achieved by performing venting slits, following insertion of 3-0 Supramid. This could prevent too high IOP in the early postoperative period while allowing for encapsulation at the tube's plate.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>In our case series, all tubes were flow tested before insertion and they all resulted in patent. Given the variation in manufacturing conditions, flow testing all glaucoma drainage devices before insertion is of paramount importance in order to avoid the risk of intraoperative complications.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> All 350 mm<sup>2</sup> BVTs were internally ligated with a 3-0 Supramid suture as well as externally ligated with a 10-0 nylon suture, which was then suture lysed after 3&#x02013;4 weeks if the IOP was suboptimal. The Supramid internal ligation suture was then fully removed after a minimum of 4 weeks for further IOP lowering if clinically indicated.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report 12-month outcomes of internal 3-0 Supramid suture removal following 350 mm BVT surgery. At 12 months we report a 46% decrease in IOP and 32% reduction in number of antiglaucoma medications. The final mean IOP was 15.2 &#x000b1; 5.3 mm Hg, similar to the 3 years IOP outcome in the Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) trial reported as 13.0 &#x000b1; 4.9 mm Hg.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> A significant proportion of the patients in this series had moderate to advanced glaucoma and hence required adjunctive antiglaucoma medication following Supramid removal; the mean being 1.3 &#x000b1; 0.9 at 12 months. This compares similarly to the 12 months outcomes in the TVT study where the mean number of medications in the Baerveldt group was 1.3 &#x000b1; 1.3, and explains why only 4 eyes of 24 (16.6%) had a complete success for an IOP &#x02264; 21 mm Hg in our study. We also identified a strong correlation between the IOP before the internal ligation suture being removed and percentage drop in IOP following its removal. Patients with high-flow glaucoma in which the IOP was &#x0003e;30 mm Hg before Supramid removal had a greater percentage drop in IOP, as can be seen in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. The &#x0201c;high-flow&#x0201d; aqueous in these patients can partially overcome the fibrovascular scarring at the end plate and hence earlier Supramid removal should not be considered in these patients, to mitigate the risk of hypotony. The time to Supramid removal was not correlated with percentage drop in IOP (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) and suggests that sufficient fibrovascular resistance has developed at the end plate at 4&#x02013;6 weeks following BVT surgery, and that any further resistance which may develop after that time point does not hinder the success of Supramid removal.</p><p>The complications rate was relatively low. Two patients had hypotony, although there were no related clinical signs, nor vision loss and there was no need for any surgical reintervention. Only one patient had to be brought back to theater for anterior vitrectomy due to vitreous in the anterior chamber.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is the limited sample size. Further subgroup analysis with glaucoma etiology, alternative internal ligation suture removal analysis as well as longer term follow-up will provide further insight into outcome measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>C<sc>onclusion</sc></title><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the removal of the internal ligation suture following BVT surgery can significantly reduce the IOP at 12 months with a smaller medication index. Higher preoperative pressures lead to greater percentage reductions in IOP and hence these patients could be at higher risk of hypotony. A proactive postoperative management regime following BVT surgery is needed to ensure the best possible outcome is achieved.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"

The academic and training schedule of the medical residents in the last year was also disrupted. Since we are in the early phase of the second peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is time to reconsider the causes of stress in anesthesia residents and methods to mitigate them. In this non-systematic review, authors have included articles from PubMed, Medline, and Google scholar with keywords &#x0201c;identify strategies&#x0201d; &#x0201c;preventing and treating psychological disorders,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;medical students&#x0201d; from year 2010 onwards were included. Apart from these keywords, we have included the coping strategies and early psychiatric consultation methods. This review article aims at early identification, workplace environment changes, and implementation of early coping strategies in anesthesia residents during this second peak of COVID-19.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>burnout</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>post-traumatic stress disorder</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In December 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) hit Wuhan, China and in no time, it was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. The challenges faced by anesthesia residents during last one year were substantially greater than those encountered in their normal work. Being in the forefront, it is natural to relate to fear as they understand the spread better.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Challenges range from negative emotions, depletion of personal protection equipment, lack of specific drugs, and feelings of being inadequately supported in workplace add to the mental burden of the health care workers.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Now, with a better understanding of the COVID-19 and its medical problems, it is very important to identify psychological signs and symptoms and mitigate them at the earliest.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In this non-systematic review, authors have included articles from PubMed, Medline, and Google scholar with keywords &#x0201c;identify strategies&#x0201d; &#x0201c;preventing and treating psychological disorders,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;medical students&#x0201d; from year 2010 onwards. The article also includes coping strategies and early psychiatric consultation. Implementation of these suggested mitigation strategies may help residents and senior members of anesthesia for early identification, workplace environment changes, and coping strategies to support residents during this early phase of second peak of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec><title>Challenges Faced by Anesthesia Residents and Possible Causes Due to of COVID-19 Pandemic</title><sec><title>Mental health of residents [<xref rid="JOACP_104_21-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>]</title><fig position="float" id="JOACP_104_21-f001"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Stepwise approach to deal with mental stress-related issues</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-38-3-g001" position="float"/></fig><p>The pandemic all of a sudden produced an undue pressure over the health care workers, especially the anesthesia residents, due to the high risk of contacting COVID-19 infection during tracheal intubation and ventilatory care.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On average, the prevalence of depressive symptoms among medical students has been reported to be 27.2% (9.3&#x02013;55.9%) and suicidal ideation in up to 11.1% (7.4&#x02013;24.2%) during medical school.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Suicidal attempts were reported higher in students reporting either 1-2 stressful events including multiracial students, having sexual minorities like bisexual or transgender.[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] One of the major triggering factors for suicidal attempt found was inter-personal relationship conflicts. The other triggering factors were mental illness in the form of delusions, hallucinations, and lack of improvement despite medications.[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] An individualized web-based screening approach is a promising strategy to identify students at high risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors during their academic career.[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Medical institutions should assign a tutor or a senior faculty so that the medical students can raise their mental health issues through a proper channel. Depressive disorder is considered as just one among them. Several other conditions like anxiety, burnout and related issues are notified through studies by the medical students. Hence, even though the students are aware of their condition, the number of students seeking help is minimal and early identification is helpful to tackle this condition. Studies report a 6-staged processed model, i.e. from stage 0 to 5. This stage model starts from prevention phase to re-integration phase and the students can enter any of the phase according to their mental health status.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, up to 50% of healthcare workers experienced posttraumatic stress (PTSS).[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] PTSS has been observed in up to 7% of 285 residents in the acute phase of the study and was expected to increase with the progress of the pandemic.[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In a systematic review, authors reported that organizational and social support, clear communication, and developing a sense of control were protective factors in mitigating adverse mental health outcomes among health-care workers during epidemic.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hence, identifying and empathizing with residents can reduce the stress and to some extent the miscalculated severe cases of mental disease due to stress and burnout [<xref rid="JOACP_104_21-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="JOACP_104_21-t001"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Challenges faced by anesthesia residents and possible causes due to of COVID-19 pandemic</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Challenges of Anesthesia residents</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Possible causes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mental health of residents</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High-risk of contacting COVID-19 infection <break/>Prevalence of depressive symptoms <break/>Multifactorial causes for suicidal thoughts <break/>Anxiety, burnout and related issues</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Effect of pandemic on academics and training</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Increased average number of working hours per week for residents due to work in both COVID and non-COVID areas. <break/>Diminishing experience gained by the trainee and opportunity to be signed off for a workplace-based assessment. <break/>Reduced clinical experience, caseload, and sub-specialty experience <break/>Evaluation and grading: Cancelled educational activities, postponed examinations. <break/>Academic conferences and paper presentations: Paper presentations and research publications are reduced and only online options are available.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Measure psychological and mental stress among residents</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Depression anxiety stress scale (DASS) <break/>The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) <break/>General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12 <break/>Sense of Coherence (SOC)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Effect of pandemic on academics and training</title><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Working hours: The anesthesia residents are being subjected to work in both COVID and non-COVID areas. During COVID duty, hours are being shortened to decrease the risk of exposure but in non-COVID area duty areas, the timings have been increased to restrict the number of people working to reduce many teams coming in contact.[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Skill and training opportunities: Anesthesia residents are exposed to aerosol-generating procedures like bag and mask ventilation, tracheal intubation, suctioning, and percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. However, nebulization in COVID areas is not permitted and closed system suctioning is practiced to reduce aerosol generation. Video laryngoscope is not available in all areas for tracheal intubation. Moreover, to maintain safety, the most experienced anesthesiologist performs the procedure leading to reduced opportunities for recently entered anesthesia residents for training. Residents report that reduced caseload, sub-specialty experience, and supervised procedures in non COVID are impairing their learning and hands-on training. Online teaching and training are a somewhat poor substitute for simulators and supervised procedures performed on patients.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The facility of simulators is not easily available in all training centers.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Evaluation and grading: Cancelled educational activities, postponed examinations, and altered rotations threaten progression through training. Online tools have been used for subjective assessment of the knowledge of residents. The delay/postponement leads to anxiety among the residents as they must undergo extensions of training period and financial commitment.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>Academic conferences and paper presentations: Medical meetings and conferences are considered as a part of curriculum in medical training program. Unfortunately, the pandemic is stressing physical and social distancing; hence, we have to rely on recorded lectures and webinars to get updated. Paper presentations and research publications have come into a halt due to the acute health crisis. Therefore, the quality of the training period is affected which is adding up to the mental stress to the residents.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p></list-item></list>

This helps in measuring anxiety, depression, stress, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) independently. It consists of 7 items per subscale and each subscale with a score ranging from 0 to 3. The sum is made by adding up the scores of each subscale and multiplying it with the factor of 2. The total DASS score ranges from 0&#x02013;120 and the DASS subscale score ranges from 0&#x02013;42.

Strategies like &#x0201c;group therapy&#x0201d; are likely to be beneficial for those who are highly stressed due to the working environment. Group therapy helps an individual to acknowledge that it is not he/she alone who is having any psychological problem and that there are others like him/her. In addition, while in such a therapy, the participants are able to exchange ideas with each other, including sharing effective coping strategies.[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Coping strategies included respecting one&#x02019;s limits, setting priorities, avoid comparisons, and involving leisure activities.[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Trainer-trainee teaching and e-learning:</italic> A multimodal approach can be used for the well-being of the physician as well as the medical trainee in this pandemic era of physical and social distancing [<xref rid="JOACP_104_21-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>].

It was reported that 67% of medical students produced fewer symptoms of stress at the end of course; 76% adopted new coping strategies; and 90% considered that this learning activity was useful for identifying stressors and sharing them with colleagues. These types of courses should be included to allow students to express their subjectivity and interact with colleagues, and prophylactic actions should be introduced to alleviate distress inherent in the process of medical education.[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p></list-item></list>

The development, implementation, and uptake of vaccines against COVID-19 is critical to disease prevention and control of the pandemic. The success of a vaccine relies on both effectiveness and population-wide uptake <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A vital element in determining the potential uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is the public's overall acceptance and confidence in vaccines, which may be impacted by public health messaging, or misinformation, regarding the spread of the virus and safety of novel vaccine <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been increased awareness of the vaccine development process and of the importance of vaccines for controlling infectious diseases, which may impact COVID-19 vaccine uptake, but also uptake of other vaccines, such as the seasonal influenza vaccine. In Canada, a seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended for everyone six months of age and over <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and is available every fall (from September to November) prior to the historical annual start of the influenza season in the northern hemisphere. In British Columbia (BC), the seasonal influenza vaccine is covered by the provincial medical service plan for many priority populations and delivered through public health and family health care clinics. Eligible individuals not included on the priority population list have been able to receive seasonal influenza vaccine for purchase at most pharmacies, however, for the 2021&#x02013;2022 seasonal influenza vaccine program, all eligible individuals are provided the influenza vaccine free of charge <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In addition, BC requires all healthcare workers to be immunized against influenza annually, or else they are required to wear a mask within all healthcare facilities for the duration of influenza season. Despite wide availability of seasonal influenza vaccine, only 42&#x000a0;% of Canadians 18&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years of age received the vaccine in 2019&#x02013;2020, which was similar to the previous 2018/2019&#x000a0;year <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Investigating the relationship between intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and future seasonal influenza vaccine uptake, while considering changes in the perceived value of vaccines over the course of the pandemic, will help to inform government and public health immunization programs for ongoing COVID-19, seasonal influenza, and future COVID-19 booster vaccination campaigns <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">The objectives of this analysis were to: 1) assess the relationship between intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and intention to receive a seasonal influenza vaccine, 2) estimate if there was a change in the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by time over the course of the pandemic, and 3) explore retrospective changes in the perceived value of vaccines pre-pandemic compared to during the pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Methods</title><p id="p0025">The COVID-19 Rapid Evidence Study of a Provincial Population Based Cohort for Gender and Sex (RESPPONSE), was a population-based study aimed at measuring the prevalence of COVID-19 and the pandemic impacts based on sex and gender, led by the investigators at Women&#x02019;s Health Research Institute.

Given booster COVID-19 vaccine doses are now being recommended <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, with the potential for future seasonal doses similar to seasonal influenza vaccines, there is an opportunity to leverage vaccine intention to encourage uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the seasonal influenza vaccine <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, with the potential for safe and effective concomitant vaccine delivery of seasonal vaccines in the future <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p id="p0120">The overall reported intention to receive a future seasonal influenza vaccine (69.0&#x000a0;%), is a marked increase from 55&#x000a0;% that said they regularly receive influenza vaccine, and a significant increase from the estimated uptake rate of 42&#x000a0;% for the seasonal influenza vaccine just prior to the pandemic in Canada (from the 2019&#x02013;2020 Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Coverage Survey), however, is still below the national target levels of 80&#x000a0;% <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It is important to note that in BC there is a requirement for healthcare workers to be immunized against influenza yearly, otherwise, they are required to wear a mask within all healthcare facilities for the duration of the influenza season.

We found that historical receipt of influenza vaccine was also associated with intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, with a graduated relationship based on the frequency of past influenza vaccine receipt. However, once we controlled for sociodemographic factors and other vaccine-intention variables that were previously found to be significant <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, in addition to intention to receive a future seasonal influenza vaccine, we found a non-significant difference in COVID-19 vaccine intention for those who regularly receive the seasonal influenza vaccine compared to those who infrequently received, or have not received the influenza vaccine in the last five years.</p><p id="p0130">Sociodemographic factors and other vaccine intention predictors identified in previous analyses of COVID-19 vaccine intention remained significantly associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Previously, we found intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was associated with being male, being an essential worker, having more than a high school education, and identifying as a visible minority. After consideration for intention to receive influenza vaccine, change in intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine over time, and retrospective change in the perceived value of vaccines, significant group differences remained based on sex and occupation. Overall, older participants (&#x0003e;60&#x000a0;years of age) were more likely to intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, although after adjustment, age was not a strong predictor of COVID-19 vaccine intention.</p><p id="p0135">Over 80&#x000a0;% of study participants indicated they intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, with the intention to vaccinate increasing over time, with was observed as a significant non-linear relationship between COVID-19 vaccine intention and date of participation. This non-linear relationship may be explained by contextual differences during the pandemic, including changing public health restrictions throughout the province in response to cases counts, global trends in COVID-19, emerging variants, rapid development of vaccine candidates <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, and uncertainty regarding vaccine availability. After multiple announcements from Health Canada in mid-November regarding the impending approval of COVID-19 vaccines, the first COVID-19 vaccine received interim use approval on December 9th, 2020 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The release of vaccine product information and clinical trial data, which demonstrated effectiveness and safety, may have been a factor in the observed increase in intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine over the study period. Another Canadian-wide survey, which examined COVID-19 vaccine intention at the beginning of COVID-19 vaccine rollout, reported that only 9&#x000a0;% of respondents indicated that would not receive a COVID-19 vaccine <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, indicating intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine may have continued to increase as COVID-19 vaccine rollout commenced. In contrast, vaccine hesitancy toward a COVID-19 vaccine, measured during the same period in another Canadian population, was lowest at the beginning of the pandemic, and increased throughout the summer and fall of 2020, before experiencing a sharp decline in vaccine hesitancy in November 2020 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In BC, as COVID-19 vaccine programs continue, reported vaccine receipt has outpaced initial estimated vaccine intention, with&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;90&#x000a0;% of eligible adolescents (12&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;years of age) and adults having received at least 1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine, prior to the pediatric (5&#x02013;11yearsold) COVID-19 vaccine approval announcement in November 2021 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Continued monitoring of vaccine intention and uptake over time will be critical to informing public health messaging and targeting vaccine outreach efforts, as information about long-term vaccine effectiveness, immunity, and safety may continue to impact COVID-19 vaccine intentions and uptake in future.</p><p id="p0140">Vaccine hesitancy has been identified as one of the top threats to global human health <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Vaccine hesitancy or acceptance is a spectrum, with one end being vaccine refusers, who are estimated to comprise a small minority (2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;%) of the population, which is consistent with our findings. We found those who were less vaccine hesitant, as measured by increased confidence in vaccines and lower perceived risk of vaccines, were more likely to intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We also explored if the overall perceived value of vaccines changed for participants due to the pandemic. We found that 9.0&#x000a0;% of the participants retrospectively reported a positive change in their perceived value of vaccines, and 84.0&#x000a0;% reported a sustained positive perceived value of vaccines from before to during the pandemic. Compared to those who held a sustained negative perceived value of vaccines, those with a positive change or a sustained positive perceived value of vaccines, were significantly more likely to intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, even after adjustment for key sociodemographic variables.</p><p id="p0145">The antecedents of vaccine hesitancy and acceptance have been theoretically modelled as the &#x0201c;3Cs&#x0201d; by Sage Working Group in 2012, and include confidence, convenience, and complacency, with an extended model adding the components of collective responsibility and calculation <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The positive change in the perceived value of vaccines during the pandemic may be explained by factors related to a change in complacency (previously not perceiving vaccine preventable diseases as high-risk). We also found a small percentage (2.1&#x000a0;%) of respondents reported a negative change in their perceived value of vaccines, which may be related to factors of confidence (due to a new vaccine) or calculation (the need for extensive information searching). This exploratory analysis of the change in the perceived value of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests a need for further study of the impact of the pandemic on overall perceptions of vaccines. Given that the majority of respondents reported positive attitude towards the vaccines, there is a potential opportunity to leverage the perceived benefits of vaccines overall to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake, in both those who intend to receive a seasonal influenza vaccine and those who do not. However, recent concerns have arisen about the potential impact of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance on the uptake of other vaccines, notably the seasonal influenza vaccine in countries with varied COVID-19 vaccine uptake <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Continuing to monitor the relationship between uptake and intention to receive COVID-19, and seasonal influenza vaccines will help to inform future public health immunization policy and programs.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Limitations</title><p id="p0150">This study has some limitations to consider. The first limitation is the potential for selection bias based on participants being selected from pre-existing research cohorts; it is possible that these participants are more research-minded and less vaccine hesitant. Therefore, they are more likely to receive vaccines or intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, as the survey was recruited for and delivered online, the sample may be missing responses from individuals with limited Internet access. Our study participants are also predominately women and identify as a non-visible minority, which limits the generalizability of our findings to the overall population in BC.</p><p id="p0155">We may also have some misclassification of self-reported influenza vaccine history, however by grouping vaccine receipt into the three categories we aimed to minimize the impact of recall bias for specific doses received in the last 5&#x000a0;years. The impact of the pandemic on the perceived value of vaccines was measured using a crude examination of a participant&#x02019;s reported perceived value of vaccines at two time points: pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. However, recall biased may have influenced this measure given participants were asked to retrospectively report their perceived value of vaccines pre-pandemic.</p><p id="p0160">The period of time when the survey was administered plays a crucial role in interpreting the findings. The recruitment occurred between August 2020 and March 2021, with the majority of participants completing the survey prior to the vaccine approval announcements, and before the press releases regarding the safety of vaccines. Survey responses received after the approval of the COVID-19 vaccines showed more willingness to receive vaccines among participants, potentially due media coverage and release of vaccine product information, which represented a shift from a conceptualization of a vaccine to the actualization of a vaccine. It is also important to note that in the second half of the study period increased public health control measures came into effect as COVID-19 rates began to increase. In regards to study timing, we did not measure vaccine intentions at the time of information release regarding vaccine safety signals for rare potential side effects, which may have also impacted intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The dynamic landscape of the pandemic, and vaccine development, illustrates the need for continued monitoring of vaccine intentions and ultimately uptake of vaccine overtime.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0165">Our analysis found that overall COVID-19 vaccine intention was&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;80&#x000a0;%, and that intention to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine is associated with intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, which is an important relationship to explore for implementation and planning of COVID-19 booster doses. We found an increase in intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after public announcements of vaccine approval, which highlights the importance of ongoing monitoring of vaccine uptake, and acceptability, as information on vaccine developments continue to emerge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0170">The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: [<bold>MS</bold> is supported via salary awards from the <funding-source id="gp070"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100016163</institution-id><institution>BC Children&#x02019;s Hospital Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source>, the Canadian Child Health Clinician Scientist Program, and the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research. <bold>MS</bold> has been an investigator on projects funded by GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi-Pasteur, Seqirus, Symvivo and VBI Vaccines.

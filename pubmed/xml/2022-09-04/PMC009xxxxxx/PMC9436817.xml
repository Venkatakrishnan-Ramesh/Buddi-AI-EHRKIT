The imbalance between injury and repair is thus a common feature for thrombus formation caused by both plaque rupture and endothelial erosion.

The chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. Analysis of variance with Dunnett post hoc test for multiple pairwise comparisons was used to compare more than 2 groups. Correlation coefficients between continuous variables were calculated using the Spearman rank test. Multivariable linear regression models with results presented as regression coefficient (&#x003b2;) with 95%&#x000a0;CI were used to adjust for baseline covariates when evaluating the correlations of HGF/soluble (s)TRAIL receptor-2 and HGF/caspase-8 ratios&#x000a0;with age, sex, diabetes, current smoking, body mass&#x000a0;index, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, fasting glucose, triglycerides, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure included as independent variables. The associations among HGF, HGF/sTRAIL receptor-2, and HGF/caspase-8 tertiles and time to the respective first cardiovascular event during follow-up was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the HR with 95%&#x000a0;CI after adjustment for baseline covariates (age, sex, current smoking, diabetes, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, and systolic blood pressure). To correct for the potential effect of mortality (all-cause) on the outcomes, we also performed competing risks regression according to Fine and Gray proportional subhazards model.

Autocrine and/or paracrine HGF stimulation is also important for the ability of these cells to activate repair responses including cell migration and proliferation. Interestingly, HUVECs demonstrated a clearer dose response to HGF in the migration assay (in&#x000a0;vitro scratch injury) than in assays also reflecting cell proliferation, possibly indicating the involvement of different signal pathways. 2) The ability of SMCs to secrete HGF is substantially greater than that of ECs but both cell types can respond to autocrine and/or paracrine HGF stimulation. 3) Autocrine and/or paracrine HGF stimulation is important for the ability of ECs to express other endothelial mitogens such as VEGF-A and PlGF, suggesting that HGF, autocrine and/or paracrine, is a key regulator of endothelial repair. 4) HGF activates the expression of collagen genes in human arterial SMCs, and human plaques with a high HGF content are enriched in collagen and elastin. The HGF content in plaques that have caused an acute cerebrovascular event is lower than in plaques that have remained asymptomatic. 5) Both ECs and SMCs respond with increased HGF expression in response to stress. These observations imply that HGF expressed by stressed vascular cells plays a role in protection against cell death, promotion of tissue repair processes, and maintaining plaque stability. The ability of HGF to stimulate growth and migration of ECs and SMCs has been shown before, but the observation that in human ECs and SMCs this largely is dependent on autocrine and/or paracrine stimulation is novel.</p><p id="p0135">An important question is whether the association between high levels of HGF in circulation and an increased risk of cardiovascular events can be consistent with a cardiovascular protective role of HGF. One possible explanation to this apparent paradox could be that elevation of circulating HGF levels occurs because of release of HGF from stressed vascular cells activating repair responses. In this case, the association between HGF and cardiovascular risk would be explained by the factors that cause vascular damage rather than by a pathogenic role of HGF. The observations that plasma HGF correlates with presence of cardiovascular risk factors known to cause vascular injury and that most of the associations of HGF with risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death are lost when controlling for these risk factors is well in line with this possibility. Moreover, plasma HGF correlated strongly with the plasma levels of sTRAIL receptor -2 and caspase-8. The former is released from cells that have received a signal to initiate apoptotic cell death through activation of so-called death receptors on the cell surface.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> Caspase-8 is an intracellular mediator of death receptor&#x02013;activated cells, but it is not released from the cells until they start to disintegrate. Both sTRAIL receptor-2 and caspase-8 thus serve as markers of cellular stress, but caspase-8 is likely to represent a marker of a more advanced stage of cell injury than the sTRAIL receptor-2 is. Against this background, we postulated that a weak ability to respond to cellular stress with increased expression of HGF results in an impaired tissue repair response and that in the vasculature this may lead to an increased risk of acute cardiovascular events. In the present study we found that subjects with a low HGF/caspace-8 ratio had increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Moreover, these associations remained statistically significant when controlling for major cardiovascular risk factors and death by other causes. A low ability to respond to cellular stress with increased HGF expression as assessed by the HGF/sTRAIL receptor-2 was also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but this association only remained significant for cardiovascular death when controlling for major cardiovascular risk factors and death by other causes. It was also associated with more severe coronary and carotid artery disease. Collectively, these observations suggest that a low ability to respond with increased expression of HGF during conditions with systemic cellular stress is associated with an increased risk for development of atherosclerosis, plaque vulnerability, and acute cardiovascular events. It will be important to identify the factors responsible for a decreased ability to express HGF in response to cellular stress. The present observations suggest that it may be the result of high age and exposure to cardiovascular risk factors causing an exhaustion of vascular repair responses.</p><p id="p0140">The idea that HGF has a protective function in the cardiovascular system is not new, but the focus has been on protection of ischemic myocardium and angiogenesis in ischemic tissues rather than on arterial repair.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Cardiomyocytes express HGF in response to ischemia/reperfusion,<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> and HGF becomes elevated within a few hours in patients with acute myocardial infarction.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> HGF protects cardiomyocytes from apoptosis in an autocrine or paracrine manner by blocking apoptotic signal pathways<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> as well as the excessive autophagy that can be activated by oxygen radicals.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> The angiogenic properties of HGF are also considered to be of importance for the formation of new vessels in ischemic tissues.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> The question of whether the protective effects of HGF on the cardiovascular system also extend to reducing the risk for development of myocardial infarction and stroke has gained less attention. Using a similar in&#x000a0;vitro scratch injury as applied in our study, McKinnon et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> showed that rat SMCs that migrated into the wound began to express c-Met and responded to HGF with increased migration. HGF was also shown to promote carotid re-endothelization after a superficial injury to the endothelial layer of rat carotids.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Although these findings suggested a role of HGF in arterial repair, this notion was questioned by epidemiological studies reporting that high circulating levels of HGF are associated with more severe atherosclerosis and an increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> This association was confirmed also in our study, but we also present evidence that this association represents activation of a repair response to systemic organ stress and that a weak ability to mount such a response increases the risk of cardiovascular events. It could also be argued that the antifibrotic effects of HGF, which are mediated by inhibition of TGF-&#x003b2;<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and stimulation of MMP expression,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> could contribute to plaque vulnerability. However, HGF in atherosclerotic plaques correlated strongly with the plaque content of both collagen and elastin contents. Plaque HGF also showed a stronger correlation to the plaque content of MMP inhibitor tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2, than to MMP-2 and MMP-3. Moreover, HGF was found to stimulate the expression of collagen genes in HCASMCs in an autocrine manner and/or a paracrine manner. These observations do not support an antifibrotic function of HGF in human atherosclerotic plaques, but rather they are in line with a profibrotic plaque-stabilizing effect. Another possibility could be that the angiogenic effects of HGF could contribute to in-growth of vessels from the adventitia increasing the risk for intraplaque hemorrhage. However, as there was no correlation between the plaque levels of HGF and the red blood cell marker glycophorin A this seems less likely.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="p0145">The analyses of biomarkers in the MDC study were based on baseline levels only, and we have no information on variation in levels during the follow-up period. The clinical biomarker data only provide information about associations and do not provide evidence of causality. However, a strength of the present study is the use of experimental models that can help to understand the pathophysiological processes behind these associations. The clinical validity of the biomarkers used to assess cellular stress (eg, circulating sTRAIL receptor-2 and caspase-8) remains to be confirmed. Cell culture studies have shown that they are released from cells following activation of apoptosis, but it remains unknown whether other processes may also be involved in their release into the circulation. We did not observe any association between treatment with different medications and the plaque content of HGF in our study. Because statin treatment is known to increase the viability carotid plaque cells,<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> it could be anticipated that statins would be associated with less vascular cell stress and hence a lower protective HGF response. However, because 87.5% of the patients in our cohort were treated with statins it is likely that the present study did not have sufficient power to identify such an effect if one exists.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0150">The present study provides evidence for a protective role of HGF in CVD and shows that subjects with a low ability to express HGF in response to cellular stress have an increased risk for development of cardiovascular events. Therapies that mimic HGF or stimulate the expression of HGF may have the potential to provide additional protection to subjects with residual risk on current preventive treatments.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><label>Perspectives</label><p id="p0155"><bold>COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE</bold>: Most acute ischemic cardiovascular events are caused by destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. The integrity of these plaques depends on the balance between the injury caused by risk factors and the ability of the vascular wall to repair this injury. Patients receiving state-of-the-art risk factor intervention remain at an increased risk of recurrent events. The present study shows that this residual risk may be caused by a reduced ability of the vascular wall to express repair factors such as HGF.</p><p id="p0160"><bold>TRANSITIONAL OUTLOOK</bold>: Identification of novel targets for intervention is needed to further reduce the risk of recurrent events in subjects with ischemic CVD. One possibility that has gained considerable attention during recent years is anti-inflammatory therapy, but increased risk of infections remains a limitation with this approach. The present observations suggest that stimulating the expression of and/or mimicking the effects of vascular repair factors such as HGF represent an alternative approach.</p></boxed-text></p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Funding Support and Author Disclosures</title><p id="p0165">The work was supported by the Swedish Society for Medical Research, Emil and Wera Cornell Foundation, Hjelt Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Foundation for International Cooperation in Research and Higher Education, Crafoord Foundation, the Swedish Medical Society, Diabetes Foundation, Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation, Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation, Albert P&#x000e5;hlssons Foundation, Sk&#x000e5;ne University Hospital (SUS) Foundations and funds, Lund University Infrastructure grant &#x0201c;Malm&#x000f6; Population-based Cohorts&#x0201d; (STYR 2019/2046), and Lund University Diabetes Center (Swedish Research Council&#x02013;Strategic Research Area Excellence of Diabetes Research in Sweden (Exodiab) grant number 2009-1039 and the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research grant number IRC15-006), National Natural Science Foundation of China grant 82120108004 (Dr Liang) and 82100479 (Dr Chen).

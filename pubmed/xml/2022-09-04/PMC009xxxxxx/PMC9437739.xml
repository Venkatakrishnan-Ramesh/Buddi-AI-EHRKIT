Study stage 2 objectives were to engage stakeholders in evaluating these recommendations and analyse likely influences on access to the support identified.</p><sec><title>Design</title><p>A two-stage, multimethod cross-sectional study was conducted from a postpositivist perspective. Stage 1 included an international online survey of people&#x02019;s experiences of illness, particularly COVID-19, in isolation (n=675&#x02009;full responses). Stage 2 involved a further online survey (n=43), two tweetchats treated as large online focus groups (n=60&#x02009;and n=27 people tweeting), two smaller focus groups (both n=4) and one interview (both using MS teams).</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Stage 1 had an international emphasis, although 87% of respondents were living in the UK.

Diagnosis is usually prompted by key symptoms, including cough, fever and fatigue and common tests are real-time reverse transcripterase PCR and lateral flow assay.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The pandemic has had fundamental impacts on society worldwide, including the need to socially distance and isolate from other people for varied periods of time. The pandemic context has affected people&#x02019;s experiences of illness in various ways, which must be explored, along with their perceptions of support needs.</p><p>COVID-19 has increased ill health in several ways. First, enormous numbers of people worldwide have contracted COVID-19 and experienced more and less severe symptoms. People with the most severe symptoms were often treated in hospital wards and critical/intensive care units (ICUs).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Evidence indicates that people have multiple support needs after experiencing a period of critical care, due to &#x02018;post-ICU syndrome&#x02019;.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Many people had highly distressing experiences of COVID-19 while at home or other accommodation. Other people were &#x02018;shielding&#x02019;&#x02014;socially isolating due to higher risk of experiencing life-threatening symptoms of the virus. Frequently this was due to an existing or new long-term health condition which may have worsened due to negative impacts of the pandemic on provision of routine health interventions, lifestyle behaviours and mental health.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Longer-term impacts of COVID-19 have now been identified. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated that in March 2021 around 10% of people in the UK who had experienced COVID-19 were experiencing &#x02018;Long Covid&#x02019;.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This is a term now commonly used to describe ongoing COVID-19 symptoms and impacts. The ONS found that around 18% of people self-reporting Long Covid felt that it significantly limited their day-to-day activities, posing a further public health challenge due to risk of developing further non-communicable health conditions.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The National Institute for Health Research has progressed successive dynamic reviews focusing on Long Covid in 2020 and 2021.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> They found multiple body systems to be affected and suggested that Long Covid may be involve several different syndromes, possibly present at the same time.</p><p>A review of evidence relating to epidemics and health emergencies over recent years highlighted the risk of a &#x02018;postpandemic double burden of disease&#x02019; due to these ongoing impacts.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> At a time when people&#x02019;s support needs have been changing so much and so fast, this study aimed to:</p><p>Study stage 1</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Explore people&#x02019;s experiences of illness due to COVID-19 while feeling socially isolated or socially isolating.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identify perceptions of what people felt would support their recovery.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Synthesise the insights into recommendations for supporting people after COVID-19.</p></list-item></list><p>Study stage 2</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Engage stakeholders in evaluating these recommendations and analysing likely influences on access to the support identified.</p></list-item></list><sec id="s1-1"><title>Patient and public involvement</title><p>At an early stage of the project we contacted a person who had recently experienced COVID-19 and invited her to be a member of the research team (KS&#x02014;coauthor). She provided valuable insights into the generation of all project materials, survey length and clarity, interpretation of analysis and development of the report. During study stage 1, we were contacted by members of a developing peer support group called &#x02018;Long Covid Support&#x02019; (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.longcovid.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.longcovid.org/</ext-link>). We involved them as we moved forward, developing a constructive collaboration with them and a peer support and campaigning group that developed in affiliation with them&#x02014;&#x02018;Long Covid Scotland&#x02019; (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.longcovid.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.longcovid.org/</ext-link>).

The survey was created using Qualtrics Online Survey Software (2020 Qualtrics&#x02014;licence for use held by the Higher Education Institution). It was designed to focus on the specific study aims and included two validated questionnaires (described later). The survey was piloted within the research team and then with ten potential participants to ensure its usability. Some improvements were made to its format to enable easier completion on a mobile phone. Once final, the survey was circulated through research team networks and promoted extensively using social media (eg, using our Twitter handle @SupportAfterCovidStudy). The survey was designed for all people aged 18 or over internationally, who could respond in English, irrespective of whether or not they experienced illness or social isolation. The study aimed to recruit as large a number of people as possible, ideally over 500 in order to ensure that people who had experienced COVID-19 in isolation were represented. No sample calculation was conducted; instead, the aim was to promote the survey widely to ensure wide participation within the short timescale. People saw an email, tweet, or post online with a brief invitation to view the study webpage (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.cpcpr.org/COVID-19" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.cpcpr.org/COVID-19</ext-link>) which held further information about the study. Advice was provided that if recalling experiences of illness while feeling isolated would cause unmanageable discomfort or distress, it would be best not to take part in the survey. The information explained that people could close the survey at any time and their data would not be analysed, but once they clicked on &#x02018;submit&#x02019;, data could not be extracted due to anonymous completion. They were informed that the survey would take 15&#x02013;20&#x02009;min to complete. If people felt that they met the criteria and were willing to participate, they clicked on the web link to the survey in Qualtrics, which implied consent. The survey questions are available online at: <ext-link xlink:href="https://26205d15-9a75-4aa4-b2d2-185aee599a78.usrfiles.com/ugd/26205d_377147626804489d92c2aec43e3a6bd4.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://26205d15-9a75-4aa4-b2d2-185aee599a78.usrfiles.com/ugd/26205d_377147626804489d92c2aec43e3a6bd4.pdf</ext-link></p><p>First, participants were asked about specific demographic characteristics and any existing physical and mental health conditions. The next questions asked if they had felt isolated and if they had, they were asked if they had experienced illness during this time. When designing the survey we focused on perception of illness, as this should be differentiated from disease.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Those who responded &#x02018;yes&#x02019; were asked if they thought this was due to COVID-19. Where someone did, they were asked for more detail about their experiences, including timing, support received and recovery. People who did not feel they had recovered were asked about the nature and impacts of their ongoing symptoms. Participants completed the validated 20-item Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and the 6-item version of the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Data from these questionnaires will be reported in depth elsewhere with treatment of missing data. Finally, all survey respondents were asked if they felt that they needed any help to support their health and well-being, with a space provided for open responses. This was the final question and all responses from this section were included in descriptive categorisation of responses as people had completed and submitted the survey. People were thanked and given further guidance on how to access support if completing the survey had led to unexpected distress. We asked people if they would be willing to be followed up in 6&#x02009;months, reported elsewhere.</p><p>Data from study stage 1 were imported into R-studio (V.1.3.1093) running R (V.4.0.3) for further organisation and advanced statistical analyses. Primarily descriptive analysis was used to develop draft recommendations about what services and/or interventions people may need to support them after having COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Study stage 2: stakeholder consultation (UK focused) on draft recommendations and access to support</title><p>A stakeholder consultation focused on finding out if the draft recommendations were appropriate, clear and sufficient, as well as gaining insights into access to support. It was important to find different ways of engaging remotely with people with diverse experiences and expertise relating to COVID-19, for example, people who had experienced COVID-19, who had family or friends who experienced COVID-19, who were involved in providing, designing or funding services for people affected by the pandemic, or in relevant policy. All participants were expected to be aged 18 or over and able to respond in English. The aim was to achieve as much participation as possible within the tight timescales of the study (approximately 3&#x02009;weeks for stage 2 data collection). Three strategies were used:</p><p>Stakeholder survey: a second online survey using Qualtrics asked for the person&#x02019;s role and degree of agreement with each recommendation in turn (5-point Likert scale: strongly disagree&#x02014;strongly agree). For each recommendation, an open question asked for the person&#x02019;s thoughts on access to the service/strategy/intervention. Participants were asked if anything was missing in the draft recommendations. Participants could also email the Principal Investigator directly if preferred. As for the first survey, the survey was promoted through research networks and social media. Survey questions can be viewed at: <ext-link xlink:href="https://26205d15-9a75-4aa4-b2d2-185aee599a78.usrfiles.com/ugd/26205d_a9882a2c2cd0455994c302becd90a682.pdf" ext-link-type="uri">https://26205d15-9a75-4aa4-b2d2-185aee599a78.usrfiles.com/ugd/26205d_a9882a2c2cd0455994c302becd90a682.pdf</ext-link>. Descriptive analysis of the results focused on frequencies of agreement with each recommendation and categorisation of open responses to questions about access to support.</p><p>Tweetchats with professional online communities: Numerous professions have online communities which meet on a regular basis for scheduled 1-hour discussions on specific topics. Two tweetchats were held as large online focus groups:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>In collaboration with WeCommunities.org (28 September 2020, including member communities such as nurses, mental health nurses, allied health professionals and healthcare managers).</p></list-item><list-item><p>With physiotalk.co.uk (5 October 2020: physiotherapy-focused online community).</p></list-item></list><p>Both tweetchats were carried out as large online focus groups, with information on the study, the draft recommendations and the key discussion questions uploaded to the appropriate websites 2&#x02009;weeks before the chat. Tweets were sent out in this period and during the tweetchat to remind people that this chat would be analysed for the Support After COVID-19 Study. Participants were informed that if they wanted their tweet(s) to be removed from analysis they could contact the researchers in the 2&#x02009;weeks following the chat to request this. Full chat information and transcripts can be found at: <ext-link xlink:href="http://wecommunities.org/tweet-chats/chat-details/5589" ext-link-type="uri">http://wecommunities.org/tweet-chats/chat-details/5589</ext-link>, and <ext-link xlink:href="https://physiotalk.co.uk/2020/09/19/support-after-covid-physiotalk-mon-5th-october/" ext-link-type="uri">https://physiotalk.co.uk/2020/09/19/support-after-covid-physiotalk-mon-5th-october/</ext-link>.</p><p>The questions and polls are provided in <xref rid="SP1" ref-type="supplementary-material">online supplemental file 1</xref>.

</p></supplementary-material><p>Online focus group discussions and individual interviews: In order to address a lack of diversity in responses to the first survey and emergence of Long Covid we carried out further qualitative data collection. The Scottish campaigning arm of LongCovid.org (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.longcovid.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.longcovid.org/</ext-link>) forwarded our email inviting their members to participate in focus groups, resulting in two separate online focus groups with four people (all women) in each. Study information was sent to the distribution list of the Third Sector Research Forum in Scotland (<ext-link xlink:href="https://evaluationsupportscotland.org.uk/tsrf/" ext-link-type="uri">https://evaluationsupportscotland.org.uk/tsrf/</ext-link>). This has member organisations that work with people who may be under-represented when it comes to research and who may experience quite specific influences on their access to support. One person agreed to participate, representing people living on low incomes. Focus groups and the interview were carried out using Blackboard Collaborate and recorded with flexible use of a topic guide. The topics focused on people&#x02019;s experiences relating to COVID-19, views on the draft recommendations (clarifications and additions), access to support, experiences that the participants would have liked to be different and key messages for people making decisions about supporting people during this time. Thematic categorisation of responses was undertaken from a postpositivist perspective.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p><xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> summarises participant numbers in study stages 1 and 2.

Although 35% of those with COVID-19 felt they had recovered, this had taken an average of over 5&#x02009;weeks.

This study has found greater prevalence of Long Covid among those who have had COVID-19 than the Office for National Statistics: approximately 20%, compared with 10%.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> This may relate to a response bias in the current study, with people more likely to respond where they have specific interest in the topic. The first study stage was a cross-sectional survey promoted by social media. Potentially related to different preferences for use of social media, participants lacked diversity, with greater participation of women and with under-representation of seldom-heard groups. It is also important to note that a large proportion of respondents were from the UK, despite international distribution of the survey. We chose to honour the respondents by including all usable data, and we were interested in perceived support needs as more universally experienced&#x02014;what people felt that they needed rather than what they had received. It is possible, however, that people may not have expressed a &#x02018;support need&#x02019; if it was being met; this may have led to differences in response from people experiencing different health systems and public health measures as regional differences exist.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Recommendations for support were based most heavily on people&#x02019;s responses to open questions, with closed questions providing further descriptive information about what people had experienced. The open questions required people to type their thoughts into the online survey tool, which could feel cumbersome or time consuming to some. Despite this, numerous very detailed responses were provided. This study was carried out at a time of rapid change and learning in relation to experiences of COVID-19. The iterative study stages and expedited ethical review enabled response to some of the changes and learning from the first stage. As a result, perspectives from people with Long Covid were explored through focus groups. The recruitment strategy for this sub-study did not focus on women, however, only women responded to the invitation. A further study could be carried out that focused on recruiting men, however, it may be necessary to use a different recruitment strategy. Additional strategies in the study also enabled some learning about seldom-heard groups, although this did not include people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. It was unexpected that none of the study stage 1 participants had been admitted to the ICU. This may be because the introductory survey information emphasised that the person should only participate if they felt that it would not be unduly distressing. It does, however, affect generalisability.</p><p>This study findings align with those of the second National Institute for Health Research dynamic review<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and Office for National Statistics data<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> in relation to the debilitating impacts of Long Covid on people&#x02019;s family and working lives. with similar findings in relation to one of the most prevalent ongoing symptoms being fatigue and a variety of other reported symptoms demonstrating involvement of different body systems. Findings are also aligned in finding Long COVID-19 to be prevalent in people of working age and who were not hospitalised due to COVID-19. It is important to note that the Office for National Statistics and National Institute for Health Research dynamic reviews highlight disproportionate impacts on people living on lower incomes and from minority groups.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> The current study adds rich insights from varied stakeholders into both support needs and aspects of policy and service design that are important to address in order to ensure people can access such support.</p><p>It is evident that long-term effects of COVID-19 are highly prevalent and people have substantial support needs. The prevalence of people living with Long Covid will keep increasing and will have substantial economic impacts due to the severity of impact in many cases and the ages of many people affected. The highly varied presentation and lack of knowledge in relation to Long Covid pose barriers to recovery. These issues intersect with lack of availability and further barriers to accessing individual services, making it exhausting for people who are ill to navigate service pathways. There was some consensus among different stakeholders that for such a new health condition, with such complexity and need for knowledge development, a &#x02018;one-stop shop&#x02019; would be most beneficial, providing support from multiple health professions, social services and vocational rehabilitation. Such support would also help people navigate other systems with potential to impact on their abilities to focus on and benefit from rehabilitation, such as seeking financial support. It was clear that need for support varies greatly, and it makes sense that the insights learnt through a focused service are then disseminated to people who need less intense help, for example, through websites and telephone helplines. This would enable specialist resources to be more focused on people who need them. Stakeholders commented on the erosion of trust in relation to health-related messages, with people experiencing feelings of abandonment that impact negatively on their mental health. It is crucial to seek ways to regain credibility and clarity. People are having very different experiences of seeking help and access to support depending on their income, type of employment, culture, experience of existing health conditions and journeys relating to COVID-19. Services must carefully consider barriers to access in their design to ensure that they do not inadvertently exacerbate health inequalities. Policy development should ensure communication between sectors such as health and social care, the third sector, workplace and employment, with careful consideration of how policies intersect.</p><p>Over 200 participants from stage 1 consented to being contacted after 6&#x02009;months in order to explore their experiences longitudinally through a follow-up survey and qualitative interviews. This will be reported elsewhere. There is much to learn from existing literature and practice experience that relate to the management of chronic fatigue and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome / Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME), and to supporting people after critical illness. Evaluation of telehealth strategies in supporting people is crucial, hopefully enabling more intense and/or in-person intervention to be made more accessible to those with greatest need. Parallel research and development are needed, however, in relation to solutions for people who are not able to use online or digital solutions for various reasons. Specific areas that emerged as requiring research and development include: impacts of COVID-19 on mental health, cognition and cardiorespiratory symptoms; its illness trajectory, relapse triggers, interventions and return to work strategies. All should meaningfully involve people with lived experience. Specifically designed research is needed that engages meaningfully with people who are seldom heard, including people from different Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. As the field develops, it may be appropriate to conduct an expert consensus study that includes people with lived experience, focusing on optimal support strategies. The area has also progressed through the development of vaccines and there is a need for further research into vaccine hesitancy&#x02014;the extent of which differs regionally.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This two-stage, multimethod study used online quantitative and qualitative tools to describe explore people&#x02019;s experiences of illness due to COVID-19 while feeling socially isolated or socially isolating and to develop recommendations for supporting people after COVID-19. This study found around one in five people who have had COVID-19 to be experiencing enduring symptoms and challenges. Fatigue and varied &#x02018;other&#x02019; symptoms were most prevalent and also had most substantial negative impacts. Recommendations were made that support access to progressive intensity and specialism of support, addressing access barriers that might inadvertently increase health inequalities. Multidisciplinary collaboration and learning are crucial, including the person with COVID-19 and/or Long Covid in planning and decision-making throughout. This field is at an early stage, with much further research needed. One area that might easily be neglected is how to support people who are vulnerable and seldom-heard, particularly people who are living on low incomes and who are from minority groups.</p><supplementary-material id="SP6" position="float" content-type="local-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056568.supp6</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p>

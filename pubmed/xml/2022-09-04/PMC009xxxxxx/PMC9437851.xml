Most deaths are sudden and occur secondary to the occlusion of coronary arteries resulting in a rapid decrease in cellular oxygen levels. Acute hypoxia is proarrhythmic, leading to disordered electrical signals, conduction block, and uncoordinated beating of the myocardium. Although acute hypoxia is recognized to perturb the electrophysiology of heart muscle, the mechanistic basis for the effect has remained elusive, hampering the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Here, we show that acute hypoxia activates the redox-sensitive SUMO pathway in cardiomyocytes, causing rapid inhibition of the inward-rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel, Kir2.1. We find that SUMOylation decreases the activation of Kir2.1 channels by the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>). These data provide a mechanistic basis for the proarrhythmic effects of acute hypoxia and offer a framework for understanding the central role of PIP<sub>2</sub> in mediating the sequelae of hypoxia and SUMOylation in cardiovascular disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Acute hypoxia inhibits the inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> current, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> in cardiomyocytes</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015">Hypoxic inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> results from rapid SUMOylation of Kir2.1 channels</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020">SUMOylation decreases the potency and efficacy of PIP<sub>2</sub> to activate Kir2.1 channels</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025">An exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> analog opposes hypoxic inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> and Kir2.1 channels</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0025"><p>Biological sciences; Molecular biology; Cell biology</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Subject areas</title><kwd>Biological sciences</kwd><kwd>Molecular biology</kwd><kwd>Cell biology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p id="misc0010">Published: September 16, 2022</p></notes></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0050">The heart has the highest basal oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) consumption per unit mass of any organ in the body and is exquisitely dependent on aerobic metabolism to maintain regular contractility and pumping throughout life.

Although acute myocardial hypoxia has been the subject of intense investigation since the early 1900s, the mechanistic basis for hypoxia-induced arrhythmia is unresolved (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Austen et&#x000a0;al., 1963</xref>).</p><p id="p0055">We recently reported that SUMOylation is upregulated in response to acute hypoxia, mediating a rapid increase in the excitability of neurons and iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Plant et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). SUMOylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification pathway that controls the activity of multiple transcription factors and a growing cadre of extranuclear target proteins (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Henley et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). SUMOs are ubiquitin-like proteins that require a stepwise enzymatic pathway to operate. Following ATP-dependent activation, SUMOs attach to the E2-ligase Ubc9 via a thiol-linkage, rendering the pathway responsive to the redox status of the cell (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Ubc9 then mediates the conjugation of SUMO-subunits to the &#x003b5;-amino group of specific lysine residues localized to the second position of the canonical SUMOylation motif, &#x003a8;-K-X-E/D, on a target protein. SUMOylation is readily reversed by the action of SENP deSUMOylases that cleave the isopeptide bond between SUMO and the target protein. Thus, despite covalent linkage to target proteins, SUMOylation is highly dynamic and labile (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hay, 2005</xref>). This facet of SUMOylation is commonly observed with ion channels, where the activity of the SUMO-pathway has been shown to increase cellular excitability via the suppression of K<sub>2P</sub> or K<sub>V</sub> channels, or by augmenting the activity of Na<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Plant et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0060">The inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> current <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> stabilizes the resting membrane potential of ventricular cardiomyocytes and shapes both the initial depolarization and final repolarization of the cardiac action potential (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dhamoon and Jalife, 2005</xref>). <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> is passed predominantly by the classical inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir2.1, with contributions from Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Zaritsky et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>).

To accomplish this, we developed an optogenetic tool that allows spatiotemporal control of SENP1 recruitment to the plasma-membrane based on a robust platform that allows control of the membrane localization of proteins of interest (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gada et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Idevall-Hagren et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ningoo et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Xu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, we fused SENP1 to the photolyase homology domain of cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) and co-expressed this construct with the transcription factor cryptochrome-interacting basic-helix-loop-helix N-terminal fragment (CIBN), which localizes to the plasma membrane via a CAAX motif.

K50 is conserved among Kir channels and in Kir2.1 is located in the third, &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; position of the SUMO-motif. Therefore, SUMOylation of Kir2.1 is expected to occur irrespective of mutations that would alter the biochemical character of the residue at this position. Consistent with this prediction, FRET and TEVC experiments showed that Kir2.1-K50A, K50Q, and K50R channels are all subject to SUMO-regulation (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures&#x000a0;S1</xref>D&#x02013;S1F).</p><p id="p0095">Next, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recording to study the functional effects of hypoxia and SUMOylation on Kir2 channels heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells.

SUMOylation occurs within minutes of the onset of hypoxia and inhibits Kir2.1 channel function, consistent with the induction of cardiac arrhythmia in hypoxic or anoxic myocardium (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sattler et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>) and prior studies in heterologous cells, neurons, and iPS-derived cardiomyocytes, (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Plant et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) a cardiac model system that does not express <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> under standard culture conditions (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Goversen et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). A direct role of SUMOylation in the hypoxia-induced inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> is supported by multiple lines of evidence. Thus, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> is insensitive to hypoxia in RVCMs studied with SENP1 in the pipette and hypoxic inhibition of the current is reversed by the action of light-activated CRY2-SENP1. <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> is also insensitive to hypoxia in Kir2.1<sup>kd</sup>-CMs. These findings are recapitulated in our PLA study which further supports that SUMOylation is specific to Kir2.1 and is not observed at Kir2.2 or Kir2.3 channels. SUMOylation of Kir2.1, but not Kir2.2 or 2.3 channel subunits is consistent with our analysis of the SUMO-consensus motif which shows that although all&#x000a0;three channels share the first three residues of this sequence, only Kir2.1 has an acidic residue in the fourth position. Intriguingly, when we substituted the asparagine residue in the fourth position of Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 with an aspartic acid we observed SUMO-regulation of channel activity (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>). This finding indicates that it is the lack of the full-canonical consensus SUMO binding site in Kir2.2 and Kir2.3 channels rather than the machinery required to transduce the effects of SUMOylation within the channel that mediates the interplay between the post-translational modification and PIP<sub>2</sub>. Lysine 49 is located on the N-terminus of Kir2.1, in close proximity to the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding pocket identified by experimentation and captured in the atomic resolution structure of Kir2.2 (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rohacs et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Although Lysine 49 is not predicted to interact directly with PIP<sub>2</sub>, we speculate that SUMOylation at this residue interferes with interactions between Kir2.1 and PIP<sub>2</sub> that are required for channel function. Given the close proximity between Lysine 49 and residues that interact with PIP<sub>2</sub> (including Lysine 50), the mechanism is likely to be via allosteric modulation of the electrostatic character of the phospholipid binding site.</p><p id="p0145">In addition to the myocardium, Kir2.1 channels are also expressed in skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, bone, immune cells, and diffusely in the cerebral cortex (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hibino et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), raising the tantalizing possibility that hypoxia-induced SUMOylation plays a more global role in pathophysiology. In contrast, we expect that this mode of regulation would not be observed in cells that predominantly express Kir2.2 or Kir2.3 channels, such as aortic endothelial cells, and neurons in the forebrain, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Cui et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Of note, Kir2.1 channels are often expressed with other Kir2 family subunits leading to the formation of, at least some, heteromeric channels (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Preisig-Muller et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Although the SUMO-sensitivity of these complexes is unclear, we speculate that a degree of channel inhibition would occur with a single SUMO-sensitive subunit incorporated into a Kir2 heterotetramer. Thus, we have previously observed that a single SUMOylated K2P1 subunit is sufficient to block the activity of K2P heterodimers in heterologous cells and cerebellar granule neurons and that a single SUMO-sensitive Kv-subunit is sufficient to convey changes in the biophysical properties of Kv2.1, Kv7.1 and <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ks</italic></sub> channels (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Plant et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Although the SUMO-stoichiometry required to impact the activity of Kir2 channels remains the subject of ongoing investigation, our studies with Kir2.1<sup>kd</sup>-CMs suggests that at least &#x0223c;27% of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> is formed by channels that do not contain SUMO-sensitive Kir2.1 subunits.</p><p id="p0150">We have previously shown that acute hypoxia elicits rapid deployment of SUMO1 to Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in cerebellar granule neurons and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels in iPS-derived cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Plant et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Although the mechanisms that underlie this behavior remain unresolved, it is apparent that the machinery that supports the redistribution of SUMO is conserved and responsive to acute hypoxic challenges across multiple types of cells, including the RVCMs and HEK293T cells, studied here. Given the rapid nature of the hypoxia-response, it is possible that the mobilized pool of SUMO1 is preconjugated to Ubc9; however, we have also previously found evidence for the localization of Ubc9 at the membrane of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, CHO-K1 cells, and hippocampal neurons (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Plant et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Rajan et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). In common with our study of acute hypoxic challenge, multiple reports have recognized that SUMOs redistribute in cells on exposure to other stressors, including osmotic shock, heat shock, nutrient starvation, and forced gene overexpression, resulting in changes in gene regulation, protein function, and stability (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chymkowitch et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Sramko et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Together these findings suggest that the mechanisms that mediate acute hypoxic SUMOylation of Kir2.1 are conserved.</p><p id="p0155">Although SUMOylation regulates the activity of several classes of membrane protein, including K<sub>V</sub>, K<sub>2P</sub>,&#x000a0;Na<sub>V</sub>, TRP, and ligand-gated channels, the mechanism by which SUMO alters the function of its target proteins has not been elucidated (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Benson et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kruse et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Martin et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Plant et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Here, we present multiple lines of evidence to support the conclusion that SUMOylation inhibits Kir2.1 by interfering with channel activation by PIP<sub>2</sub>. First, the EC<sub>50</sub> value for diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> activation of Kir2.1 is right shifted by SUMOylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>). Second, the effectiveness of CRY2-5&#x02032;ptase to diminish Kir2.1 activity is increased when Kir2.1 is SUMOylated and decreased by SENP1, consistent with an increase in the lability of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>). Third, the influence of co-expressed SUMO1 on 5&#x02032;ptase function is not observed in Kir2.1-K49Q, -K49R, or -D51N channels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;4</xref> and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>), nor does it impact the EC<sub>50</sub> of diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> on Kir2.1-K50R channels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>). Similarly, a single point mutation renders Kir2.2 and 2.3 SUMO-sensitive, suggesting that mechanisms that mediate the functional interaction between SUMO1 and PIP<sub>2</sub> are conserved in the Kir2 channel family (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>). Finally, the hypoxic inhibition of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> and heterologous Kir2.1 channels is reduced, in a concentration-dependent manner, by exogenous diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>).</p><p id="p0160">Although we report a SUMO-dependent decrease in the efficacy and potency of diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> to activate Kir2.1, our data do not determine if SUMOylation changes the affinity between PIP<sub>2</sub> and the channel. Indeed, the potency of diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> we report here (3.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) is &#x0223c;7-times greater than the affinity of purified Kir2.1 and a soluble, fluorescent variable of PIP<sub>2</sub> (450&#x000a0;nM) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Cabanos et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Functional studies of Kir2.1, considered with the perspective of structural determinations of PIP<sub>2</sub> binding to the closely related Kir2.2 channel (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), have revealed that not all residues required to coordinate PIP<sub>2</sub> impact its efficacy to activate the channel (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Donaldson et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lopes et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Rohacs et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Soom et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Xie et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). The structure of the Kir2.2-PIP<sub>2</sub> complex shows the channel in its closed state; therefore, the apparent dichotomy between structural and functional studies might reflect changes in channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity that occur as the channel visits distinct conformations during gating. Thus, further structure-guided electrophysiological and biochemical studies are required to qualify if SUMOylation acts directly to cause less avid binding of PIP<sub>2</sub>, displacement of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the binding pocket, disruption of the electrostatic action of PIP<sub>2</sub> on channel gating, or a change in the activity of other regulatory mechanisms that are not identified in this study. Similarly, whether other SUMO-modified ion channels work by altering interactions with PIP<sub>2</sub> remains to be tested.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="p0165">The data reported in this study are obtained from cultured RVCMs, and heterologous expression of relevant proteins in HEK293T cells or <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes. Some limits of this work include that the cardiomyocytes are studied <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> and not within the context of the myocardium, where they would also be exposed to exogenous physiological signals and homeostatic processes. In addition, we study all the cells at room temperature which is expected to slow the kinetics of the interactions under investigation compared to their <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> rates, including SUMOylation and deSUMOylation. Although Kir2.1 is highly dependent on PIP<sub>2</sub> for its activity our optogenetic assessment of SUMO-dependent changes in channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> interactions is, like prior work in the field, correlative based on function and is not a measure of direct binding affinity. However, these data, in concert with our macropatch study, show that SUMOylation reduced the potency and efficacy of PIP<sub>2</sub> to activate Kir2.1 channels. Finally, although <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K1</italic></sub> was studied using quasi-physiological buffers, the channel was isolated by voltage protocols and drugs that preclude the activation of Ca<sub>V</sub> and Na<sub>V</sub> channels. We have previously shown that the cardiac sodium channel, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, is SUMOylated in response to acute hypoxia (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Plant et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).

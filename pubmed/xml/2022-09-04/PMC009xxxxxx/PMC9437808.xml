To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to utilize cf-mRNA RNA-Seq to evaluate therapeutic responses in a well-characterized pre-clinical model. We sequenced a total of 174 plasma samples from mice that were treated with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and/or a JAK inhibitor at various time points. We show that cf-mRNA profiling displayed a temporal pattern of systemic immune responses elicited by LPS and dysregulation of associated pathways.

Although inflammation is crucial for protecting the body from harmful stimuli and initiating the healing process, chronic inflammation has been recognized to contribute to multiple non-infectious diseases including type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer.<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Therefore, inflammation has become a key target for drug development in multiple diseases.

For study 1, total of 38 animals were used. These animals were randomly assigned into treatment groups. The animals were treated with LPS (3 mg/kg body weight: VetOne) (time&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0). LPS was administered through intraperitoneal injection. Formulations were prepared by diluting LPS in sterile saline solution, and by combining AZD1480 (a JAK2 inhibitor) (30mg/kg body weight; Thermo Fisher) in 0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1% Tween-80, with the pH adjusted to 3.0 for AZD1480. Blood was collected from the mice via cardiac puncture at 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours post LPS administration, and control animals treated with vehicle. For the administration of AZD1480, two doses of AZD1480 were administered orally, 1 hour prior to and 3 hours post LPS administration. Animals used for the study 1 are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Although there was no prior study examining the effects of cf-mRNA dysregulation in mice, we chose animals per time point to be approximately 5 animals, based on a previous mouse study where the protein levels of an inflammatory target was measured in both blood and liver following LPS stimulation.<xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> In addition, a resource equation approach of sample size calculation<xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> indicated that the minimum sample size for study 1 to be 3 per group.</p><p id="para0014">For study 2, animals were treated with LPS (3 mg/kg body weight: VetOne and diluted in saline) (time&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0) via intraperitoneal injection and blood and selected organs were collected 4 24, 42 and 78 hours post LPS administration.

The evaluation of the gene-expression pattern in cf-mRNA showed induction of cytokine transcripts, as early as 2 hours after the LPS treatment, followed by a subsequent regression of cytokine transcripts 8 hours after the treatment (Supplementary Figure 2). We then compared the cf-mRNA transcriptome of untreated and LPS treated animals (4-hour post LSP treatment) and identified 750 differentially expressed cf-mRNA transcripts (476 upregulated and 274 downregulated, FDR &#x0003c; 0.05 was used as the cut-off criterion).

IPA pathway analysis of the individual clusters showed that these gene components are enriched in distinct biological processes and pathways (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>d and Supplementary Table 5).

The expression levels of Component 1 transcripts showed a substantial increase following LPS treatment with the highest expression level observed at 4-hours post LPS time point (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>e). Subsequently, the Component 1 transcripts declined and returned to the basal levels by 48 hours. The response we observed for this cluster is consistent to that of cytokine response.

AZD1480 is a JAK inhibitor which is known to preferentially inhibit JAK2.

Studies have begun to appear that attempt to delineate the major vesicle and particle contributors of extracellular RNA.<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Further, while non-invasive molecular biomarkers can be developed using both hypothesis dependent or hypothesis independent strategies, the present study focused on genes that are biologically relevant.</p><p id="para0038">The key limitations of the study include insufficient tissue matched plasma samples for early time points and the limited organs that were assessed. Increased time points with matched tissue samples following LPS stimulation would have allowed us to better evaluate the time delays between the molecular changes occurring in the tissue and corresponding changes that are reflected in the plasma.</p><p id="para0039">In summary, we used a mouse preclinical model to demonstrate the utility of cf-mRNA for comprehensive systemic and organ-specific transcriptomic profiling of LPS induced and JAK inhibitor modulated inflammatory and immune responses. Gruner and McManus systematic review of the evidence for extracellular RNA function in health and disease includes intercellular communication and sensors of homeostatic disruption but note the value of more definitive experimentation.<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50</sup></xref> The identification of new subclasses of extracellular complexes with extracelluar RNA cargo and heterogeneity of size and density of each subclass provide challenges that the NIH-funded Phase 2 of Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium hopes to address.<xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr"><sup>51</sup></xref> Our data highlight the potential of cf-mRNA profiling for the evaluation of drug efficacy and safety and may inform various steps of drug development and clinical trials including target engagement, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic assessment and toxicological examination.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><title>Contributors</title><p id="para0040">AI, AA, APK and ST performed the experiments.

These neoplasms mostly occur in adults between the ages of 30 and 70 whereas only &#x0003c;5% of chordomas occur in patients younger than the age of 20.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref></sup> Thus, chordomas in the pediatric population are even more rare and infrequent. When they do occur, they are found to mostly be located within the sacrococcygeal region (&#x0223c;50%), skull base (25%&#x02013;39%), and spinal column (15%).<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In children specifically, they are most likely to occur intracranially and arise from the skull base, preferentially affecting the clivus, the spinal-occipital synchondrosis of the clivus, and the sella turcica.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>Initial symptoms of a chordoma often include progressive cranial nerve deficits that worsen over time. However, in children it often manifests with vague nonspecific complaints that can delay diagnosis of the disease until the tumor becomes large.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This aspect of the disease makes achieving gross total resection difficult because the tumor is often diagnosed only after it is found to encroach on nearby critical neurovascular structures in addition to extending into the nearby craniocervical junction.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>The standard of care for this disease is initial gross total resection if feasible. This often requires a multistaged anterior and posterior approach that consists of endoscopic tumor debulking and a secondary open microscopic skull base approach tailored to the residual lesion.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Achieving a gross total resection early in the disease process is paramount for optimizing long-term progression-free survival of the disease when coupled with stereotactic proton beam radiotherapy.<sup><xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Histopathology and immunochemistry can further assist in differentiating chordomas into conventional/myxoid, chondroid, and undifferentiated, which can be used to better stratify different progression-free survival outcomes.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>In the pediatric population, gross total resection can be even more difficult to achieve because the tumor often extends to the craniocervical junction infiltrating the occipital condyles, atlas, and axis. This often necessitates removal of these structures during multiple stages of surgery.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Removal of these structures, however, can potentially cause instability of the craniocervical junction. Thus, occipito-cervical fusion (OCF) can be performed to minimize morbidity of this resulting instability that may occur especially in the presence of spinal cord compression. Currently, evidence is limited to case reports of OCF after clival chordoma resection in the pediatric population, with no definitive guidelines provided.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Therefore, the authors describe the case of a 3-year-old male patient with a clival chordoma with extension to the craniocervical junction who underwent resection using a multistaged surgical approach. He additionally underwent OCF with a good postoperative outcome.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Illustrative Case</title><sec><title>History and Examination</title><p>A 3-year-old boy presented with weakness of the left upper (3/5 proximally; 2/5 distally) and lower extremities (4/5) with no discernable cranial nerve deficits, dysmetria, or changes in reflexes. In addition, sensation to light touch was intact and the patient had a negative Hoffman and Babinski with no clonus at the ankle. Subsequent imaging demonstrated a clival mass causing mass effect upon the medulla and high cervical spinal cord with severe chronic spinal cord compression associated with mild edema within the spinal cord. The tumor extended to the craniocervical junction involving the anterior arch of C1 and the odontoid (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). This resulted in chronic high cervical spinal cord compression. A chordoma was suspected, and a treatment plan was devised to provide spinal cord decompression, optimal resection of the lesion, and stabilization of the occipital-cervical junction.</p><fig position="float" id="f1"><label>FIG. 1.</label><caption><p>Initial imaging of the patient&#x02019;s lesion.

This included resection of the inferior third of the tumor-invaded clivus as well as the entirety of the odontoid process. Given that this approach did not provide ideal access to the anterolateral tumor burden at the skull base and high cervical canal, a second stage surgery was planned the following day while the patient remained intubated and sedated (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). As a second stage, the patient underwent a left-sided far lateral craniotomy and cervical laminectomy for resection of the ventrolateral tumor at the skull base and anterolateral to the spinal cord. Given the destabilization of the craniocervical junction resulting from the anterior resection, an instrumented fusion was performed from the occiput to C3 for stabilization (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). This was performed in parallel with the far lateral craniotomy immediately after the resection portion of the surgery (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2C</xref>, <xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>, and <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Intraoperative neuromonitoring showed absent bilateral upper and lower extremity motor evoked potentials (MEPs) at baseline that did not change with either surgical procedure. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) did improve after the first surgery with a return of right upper extremity SSEPs, after initially being absent, that was stable after the second operation.</p><fig position="float" id="f2"><label>FIG. 2.</label><caption><p>Imaging after debulking and occipito-cervical fusion surgery.

He also developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and placement of a gastrostomy tube. However, he began to make excellent improvements in rehabilitation with good recovery of strength and dexterity and was discharged after 3 weeks. At his 4-week follow-up, his motor weakness and respiratory failure were completely resolved with full strength throughout (ASIA E), which was improved from his initial presentation (ASIA B). His 12-week follow-up was also unremarkable.</p><p>The etiology of his transient quadriplegia is somewhat unclear, as is the timing of his loss of function relative to the first or second surgery since he was intubated and sedated between the two interventions, which were 1 day apart. It was hypothesized to be a result of either the decompression itself and sudden re-expansion of the spinal cord after chronic compression or from a traumatic injury of the spinal cord with movement from instability prior to OCF.</p><p>Postoperative imaging showed a small amount of residual tumor within the anterolateral skull base adjacent to the medulla at the clivus near the superolateral resection cavity. The proximity of the lesion to the brainstem prohibited full-dose radiation therapy. As a result, approximately 3 months after the patient&#x02019;s initial surgery, a left-sided far-lateral craniotomy for reresection of the residual mass and debulking was performed to achieve separation prior to starting proton therapy. This surgery was performed without complication (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Observations</title><p>Chordomas are inherently lytic and intimately involved with osseous structures necessitating extensive bone removal to achieve aggressive resection, which can affect the stability of the occipito-cervical junction when this region is involved by tumor. Given this aspect, surgical stabilization is an important consideration in planning surgical treatment of clival chordomas that extend into the atlantoaxial spine.</p><p>The stability of the articulation between the occiput and C1 relies on the odontoid as well as the cup-shaped configuration and the fibrous capsule of the occipito-atlantal joint. The anterior atlanto-occipital membrane, the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane, the tectorial membrane, the alar ligaments, the cruciform ligaments and the apical ligaments all contribute to the stability of the occipito-atlantal joint.<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Consequently, any surgical approach that alters or affects these stabilizers or their insertions can introduce instability. Preoperative destruction of the occipital condyle by invasive disease or extensive operative condylectomy during resection can also contribute to instability.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>As a result, in any procedure requiring extensive resection of pathology involving the craniocervical junction, the overarching questions are: what approaches should be taken to achieve the goals of surgical resection and what is the appropriate timing of surgical stabilization such as OCF? Although the indications for internal fixation in children are similar to those for adults, the data concerning techniques, complications, and outcomes of spinal instrumentation are mainly derived from either congenital anomalies or pediatric trauma cases in previous retrospective series.<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;15</xref></sup> Decision making around OCF in the context of tumor surgery, such as in chordoma of the skull base, is not well established in children at this time.</p><p>Therefore, the authors examined all published literature to date on skull base chordomas that extend to the craniocervical junction in the pediatric population. The authors also assessed the clinical outcome and timing of OCF in these cases. Only a few case reports were found describing outcomes both with OCF (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and without OCF (<xref rid="t2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><table-wrap position="float" id="t1"><label>TABLE 1.</label><caption><p>Review of pediatric studies of clival chordoma with OCF</p></caption><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center">Authors &#x00026; Year</th><th align="center">Age, Sex</th><th align="center">Preoperative Symptoms</th><th align="center">Approach</th><th align="center">Timing of Fusion</th><th align="center">Fusion Levels</th><th align="center">Reason for Fusion</th><th align="center">Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Joyce et al., 2020<sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup><hr/></td><td align="center">15, F<hr/></td><td align="center">Nasal obstruction, dysphagia, 8&#x02013;10 pounds weight loss, left tongue deviation<hr/></td><td align="center">Left extreme lateral transodontoid approach<hr/></td><td align="center">In a second operation after initial resection<hr/></td><td align="center">OCF, unspecified<hr/></td><td align="center">Transodontoid approach<hr/></td><td align="center">At 2 months, improvement of cranial neuropathies, tolerate oral intake<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Eco et al., 2019<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup><hr/></td><td align="center">5, M<hr/></td><td align="center">Right shoulder pain<hr/></td><td align="center">Far lateral approach<hr/></td><td align="center">During the initial resection surgery<hr/></td><td align="center">O-C2<hr/></td><td align="center">Arch of C1 resection<hr/></td><td align="center">Neurologically intact at 42 months with stable oncological status<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Neil et al., 2016<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></td><td align="center">8, F</td><td align="center">1 week of progressive upper extremity weakness, 1 year history of neck pain</td><td align="center">Multistaged: endonasal, endoscopic and microscopic transclival approach, left and right far-lateral approaches with occipital cervical fusion</td><td align="center">During left far lateral approach (second surgery)</td><td align="center">O-C4</td><td align="center">Unspecified</td><td align="center">Good clinical outcome</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>OCF = occipito-cervical fusion.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="t2"><label>TABLE 2.</label><caption><p>Review of pediatric studies of clival chordomas extending to the atlantoaxial spine without OCF</p></caption><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left">Authors &#x00026; Year</th><th align="center">n</th><th align="center">Age Range</th><th align="center">Approach</th><th align="center">Outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Habrand et al., 2016<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup><hr/></td><td align="center">1<hr/></td><td align="center">9 years old<hr/></td><td align="center">Two subsequent and successful approaches, otherwise unspecified<hr/></td><td align="center">No postoperative morbidity<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Tsitouras et al., 2016<sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">10 years old</td><td align="center">TSO-TSP</td><td align="center">Died of disease 38 months after surgery</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>TSO = transoral; TSP = transpalatal; TSM = transmandibular.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Overall, pediatric cases of OCF appear largely tolerated as evidenced by previous case reports of patients undergoing OCF in addition to chordoma resection. In terms of timing, OCF can be conducted before or after tumor resection.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Advantages of performing OCF before, or at the same time as tumor resection include limiting potential postoperative morbidity or spinal cord injury that may result from instability resulting from resection of the chordoma and involved osseous structures.<sup><xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> One retrospective study of adult patients found that OCF after clival chordoma resection was associated with complications such as wound dehiscence, encephalitis, and cardiac arrest, which has been associated with mortality. When an OCF was performed as a first stage with tumor resection to follow, there were no reported significant complications. When OCF occurs during the initial surgery, there appears to be less destabilization of the cervical spine, which decreases the likelihood of spinal cord trauma.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>Disadvantages of performing OCF before or at the same time as the tumor resection include the placement of metallic material such as rods, screws and cages which pose additional challenges to particle therapy both at the time of simulation and at the time of treatment. It limits radiotherapy by multiple beam-angle restrictions and altering particle pathways.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In addition, early OCF can make it more difficult to achieve gross total resection due to limitation in head positioning and narrowing of potential surgical pathways. There is a further concern in patients with early onset chordomas, which are often associated with craniovertebral abnormalities. Consequently, it may be better to wait for when the bones have had a chance to elongate and mature before performing any permanent stabilization. Instrumentation is also found to be associated with inhibiting growth of the cervical spine in up to one-third of patients receiving cervical fusion in patients &#x0003c;16 years old.<sup><xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> To counter these disadvantages, an alternative option would include managing patients semiconservatively with external fixation and support.<sup><xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> In these instances, second step surgery after the initial chordoma resection can be planned if conservative management fails, and the patients remain symptomatic or at risk; however, these devices also carry their own set of practical challenges and morbidities.</p></sec><sec><title>Lessons</title><p>In pediatric patients with clival chordomas involving the craniocervical junction with concern for postoperative instability, OCF before or at the same time as the initial tumor resection surgery appears to allow for minimal postoperative morbidity. In most cases, performing an OCF first did not interfere with achieving maximal safe resection; however, this decision must be made on a case-by-case basis. In cases in which OCF is not immediately feasible due to concerns of the inability to achieve gross total resection or concerns of inhibiting radiotherapy, an alternative option includes managing patients semiconservatively with external fixation and secondary surgery later in time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Disclosures</title><p>The authors report no conflict of interest concerning the materials or methods used in this study or the findings specified in this paper.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conception and design: Loya, Liu, Gonda, Levy.

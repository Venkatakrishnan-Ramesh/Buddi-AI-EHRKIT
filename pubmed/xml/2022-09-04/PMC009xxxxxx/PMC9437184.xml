</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Intravitreal anti&#x02013;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A therapy is the standard of care for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The anti-VEGF agent ranibizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody antigen-binding fragment that inhibits all isoforms of VEGF-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ranibizumab intravitreal injections for the treatment of nAMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] have been well characterized.</p><p id="Par8">After intravitreal injection, ranibizumab demonstrates a phenomenon referred to as &#x0201c;flip-flop kinetics&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For most drug classes, the absorption rate exceeds the elimination rate; however, flip-flop kinetics describes the reverse scenario: kinetics in which the absorption rate is significantly slower than the systemic elimination rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For ranibizumab, absorption from the vitreous to the systemic circulation is significantly slower than the systemic elimination rate (ocular and systemic half-lives [t<sub>1/2</sub>] are observed to be&#x02009;~&#x02009;9&#x000a0;days and 2&#x000a0;h, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This results in a depot effect, where the vitreous acts as a depot that slowly releases ranibizumab into systemic circulation, where it is quickly eliminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Because the ocular clearance is the rate-limiting step, the serum PK profile directly reflects the ocular PK profile, with serum concentrations being an estimated 90,000 times lower than vitreous concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. From dosing to 30&#x000a0;days after monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg injections, serum ranibizumab concentrations range from 0.069 to 2.9&#x000a0;ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Population PK analysis of ranibizumab administered via intravitreal injection has found renal impairment status to have a statistically significant, but clinically insignificant, effect on systemic elimination of ranibizumab, with a patient&#x02019;s creatinine clearance explaining 10.5% of interindividual variability in ranibizumab systemic clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">In clinical trials of ranibizumab in which patients received monthly intravitreal injections, the serum PK profile consisted of peaks and troughs, with highest concentrations soon after the bolus dose and lowest concentrations before the next dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Within clinical trials, maximal efficacy outcomes with anti-VEGF therapy appear to be achieved with consistent treatment at regular intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In clinical practice, such outcomes have proven challenging to achieve because patients are, on average, treated less frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], resulting in poorer vision outcomes compared with clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">The Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS) is a long-acting drug delivery system that consists of a permanent, indwelling refillable implant designed to provide continuous delivery of a customized formulation of ranibizumab into the vitreous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and maintain therapeutic drug concentrations in the vitreous for extended durations. The PDS implant can be refilled in the clinic using a specially designed refill-exchange needle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The refill-exchange procedure ensures a near-total fluid exchange by simultaneously withdrawing the depleted drug remaining in the implant and injecting full-concentration drug. Based on in vitro characterization, a small percentage (~&#x02009;1&#x02013;2.5%) of the reservoir volume of 20 &#x000b5;l is released through the release control element into the vitreous during the refill-exchange procedure. Ranibizumab release from the PDS implant into the vitreous is mediated by passive diffusion across a porous titanium release control element specifically designed for ranibizumab. In vitro studies have shown that ranibizumab release from the PDS implant is a function of concentration in the implant and decays exponentially over time, following Fick&#x02019;s law (data on file). Long-term stability evaluation demonstrated that ranibizumab did not show a difference in VEGF-blocking activity after incubation at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with sodium azide and polysorbate 20 for 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The completed phase 2 Ladder trial (NCT02510794) evaluated the efficacy, safety, and PK of the PDS in patients with nAMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Patients were randomized to receive one of three doses of ranibizumab via the PDS or monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The primary endpoint was median time to first criteria-defined implant refill, which was 8.7, 13.0, and 15.8&#x000a0;months for all patients in the PDS 10&#x000a0;mg/ml, PDS 40&#x000a0;mg/ml, and PDS 100&#x000a0;mg/ml arms, respectively, as assessed at the end of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. At months 6 and 12 after implant insertion, almost 80% and 60% of patients in the PDS 100&#x000a0;mg/ml arm, respectively, did not require refill-exchange procedures based on trial criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Because the ranibizumab release rate from the implant is slow relative to both the ocular and systemic elimination rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the serum PK profiles reflect the implant release. Preplanned PK analyses were conducted as part of the Ladder trial to characterize the PK profile of ranibizumab delivered through the PDS in patients with nAMD and are reported herein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p id="Par13">Full details of the Ladder trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02510794) have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Briefly, Ladder was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active treatment-controlled, dose-ranging study of the PDS for nAMD conducted at 49 sites in the USA. The trial adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation E6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and with applicable local, state, and federal laws. All trial sites received institutional review board approval before trial initiation, and all patients provided written informed consent before enrollment.</p><p id="Par14">Patients were aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;years and had anti-VEGF-responsive nAMD in the study eye diagnosed within the 9&#x000a0;months before screening. Patients had to have received&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 injections, but not more than 9 injections, with any anti-VEGF agent in the study eye. The previous injections could have been any anti-VEGF agent; however, the final injection before initiation of study treatment was ranibizumab. Patients were not excluded if they had nAMD in the fellow eye and were permitted to receive ranibizumab treatment, or another anti-VEGF therapy if clinically indicated, in that eye throughout the trial. Fellow eye treatment was not recommended within 7&#x000a0;days of the study eye scheduled visit.</p><p id="Par15">Patients were assigned randomly 3:3:3:2 to treatment with the PDS filled with ranibizumab 10&#x000a0;mg/ml, 40&#x000a0;mg/ml, or 100&#x000a0;mg/ml formulations or to treatment with monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg injections (Lucentis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA). The PK results described here do not include patients in the oral antithrombotic substudy, which included a separate trial population of 11 patients treated in the PDS 100&#x000a0;mg/ml arm.</p><p id="Par16">For PDS patients, implant refills were performed on a pro re nata basis according to predefined criteria.

In the PDS arms, serum samples for PK analysis were collected at randomization;&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;60&#x000a0;min after implant insertion; 1, 7, and 14&#x000a0;days after implant insertion; at each monthly study visit; and 1 and 7&#x000a0;days after each refill. Optional aqueous humor samples were collected from patients in the PDS arms before or immediately after implant refill and at 7&#x000a0;days after refill. In the monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg injection arm, serum trough concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub>) samples were taken pre dose at randomization; months 1, 3, 6, and 9; and the final study visit.</p><p id="Par19">Serum ranibizumab concentrations in all patients and aqueous humor ranibizumab concentrations in PDS-treated patients were measured using two validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], with lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 15&#x000a0;pg/ml for serum and 20,000&#x000a0;pg/ml for aqueous. The two assays were designed and optimized to have different quantitative ranges to better suit the range of ranibizumab concentrations expected to be found in those two compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Briefly, serum samples were incubated overnight with a mouse monoclonal anti-ranibizumab&#x02013;VEGF complex antibody (MARA) and biotinylated VEGF; MARA&#x02013;ranibizumab&#x02013;biotinylated VEGF complexes were then captured on streptavidin-coated plates; finally, complexes were detected enzymatically using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse antibody with colorimetric detection. For the aqueous samples, ELISA plates were coated with recombinant human VEGF, blocked with a bovine serum albumin buffer, and incubated with aqueous samples diluted to the assay minimum required dilution of 1/100 in sample diluent. After washing, plates were incubated for 2&#x000a0;h with a solution of F(ab')2 fragment goat antihuman immunoglobulin G F(ab')2 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After washing, tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate was added to the plate to develop color.</p><p id="Par20">Analyses were conducted in the full study population and in the PK-evaluable population. The purpose of the analysis within the PK-evaluable population was to characterize the PK of the PDS, and thus it excluded patients whose serum and aqueous samples would not solely reflect ranibizumab release from the PDS implant. The purpose of the analysis within the full study population was to describe ranibizumab exposure in all treated patients in the study. The PK-evaluable population consisted of patients in the PDS arms only and excluded patients who received intravitreal ranibizumab injections in the fellow eye during the Ladder trial, supplemental intravitreal ranibizumab injections, or previous intravitreal injections with bevacizumab in either eye within 9&#x000a0;months before randomization. Patients who received supplemental intravitreal ranibizumab injections during Ladder were not included in the PK-evaluable population. Patients with previous intravitreal injections of bevacizumab were excluded because the ranibizumab ELISA also detects bevacizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Bevacizumab has a t<sub>1/2</sub> for systemic elimination of around 19&#x000a0;days and therefore may remain detectable in the systemic circulation for months after the last injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Patients who received previous intravitreal aflibercept injections were not excluded from the PK-evaluable population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Endpoints and Analyses</title><p id="Par21">The prespecified endpoints for the PK analysis of the Ladder trial included the observed maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) and selected postdose serum concentrations immediately after implantation and all subsequent refills, <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> before refills, and observed serum concentrations over time without refills in the PDS arms. Additional PK parameters, including area under the serum concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>0-inf</sub>; calculated using the linear-up, log-down trapezoidal rule), time to <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>), <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub>, and <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, were estimated after implantation and at subsequent refills using standard noncompartmental analysis with Phoenix WinNonlin software, version 6.4 (Cetera, L.P., Princeton, NJ, USA). For mean serum concentration-time profiles, if more than one-third of values for a given arm and sampling time point were below the LLOQ, no value was reported. The geometric mean was used to summarize serum PK data when patients were grouped based on the same time since dosing, because it is reasonable to assume the data are log-normally distributed, as typical for PK data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, when summarizing data based on time on study, when patients were at different times relative to most recent refill, median was used to summarize serum PK data because a log-normal distribution can no longer be assumed.</p><p id="Par22">A population PK model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] was used to predict serum concentrations in the monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg group.

In addition, PDS 100&#x000a0;mg/ml continued to release ranibizumab through at least month 16, after which time, the serum concentration approached the LLOQ. Additionally, within each PDS arm, the serum PK profiles of ranibizumab were consistent after initial implantation and multiple refills. The PK-evaluable population was thoughtfully defined to exclude patients with confounding factors for the serum PK measurements that impact assessment of the PDS implant release. Many of the patients in the full study population were not eligible for the PK-evaluable population.</p><p id="Par32">Extensive serum sampling was employed in all patients, providing a robust data set (5790 samples) for characterization of the PDS serum PK profile for ranibizumab. The PK profile of the full study population independent of time to refill in combination with the clinical outcome data demonstrate that PDS 100&#x000a0;mg/ml was able to deliver ranibizumab at levels that resulted in efficacious ocular ranibizumab concentrations for an extended period of time. The serum concentrations with PDS 100&#x000a0;mg/ml were within the range predicted for monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg, the dose approved for the treatment of nAMD, based on data from previous clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. PDS 100&#x000a0;mg/ml PK serum concentrations were also consistently higher than the <italic>C</italic><sub>trough</sub> values observed in the Ladder monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg arm until month 9, when PK sampling stopped in this arm. These results support the durability of the treatment effects observed with the PDS in the Ladder trial. At the median first time to refill of 15.8&#x000a0;months in the PDS 100&#x000a0;mg/ml arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], ranibizumab was still being released from the PDS implant, as supported by the measurable serum ranibizumab concentrations at month 16 in this arm.</p><p id="Par33">In clinical trials using intravitreal ranibizumab injections, there is variability in how frequently patients need treatment to maintain vision or anatomical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This variability may be driven by a variety of patient and disease state factors, of which PK variability is only one component. Therefore, the ongoing ranibizumab concentrations needed to maintain clinical efficacy in an individual patient and in an individual eye likely vary. Although systemic suppression of VEGF was not measured in this study, the serum ranibizumab concentrations with the PDS were maintained below the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg injections, which have been shown to have a minimal impact on plasma-free VEGF levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, serum ranibizumab concentrations with the PDS were below the concentrations (11,000&#x02013;27,000&#x000a0;pg/ml) thought to be necessary to inhibit VEGF biological activity by half [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for intravitreal ranibizumab 2.0&#x000a0;mg injections was the highest intravitreal dose of ranibizumab clinically demonstrated to be well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Aqueous humor PK concentrations for ranibizumab with the PDS were consistent with the serum PK concentrations and consistent with flip-flop kinetics. However, it should be noted that collection of aqueous humor samples was optional in the Ladder trial and not all sites or patients contributed samples; in addition, aqueous humor samples were collected at a limited number of time points (i.e., limited longitudinal data), and the samples that were collected were at different times across patients due to the variable timing of refill in each patient. Thus, the PK data from the aqueous humor are not as thorough as the presented serum data.</p><p id="Par35">There are several considerations for the current study. The length of time on study, timing of refills, and number of refills each patient received were variable, resulting in more limited PK assessment at later time points and after more refills. Because patients who received supplemental intravitreal ranibizumab injections were excluded from the PK-evaluable population and lower ranibizumab concentrations could have been the reason these patients met the lack of clinical efficacy criteria to require supplemental intravitreal ranibizumab injections, the observed concentrations in the PK-evaluable population may be affected by a selection bias. Furthermore, characterization of ranibizumab release at later times in the lower-dose arms was limited by the assay sensitivity. Finally, additional analyses and future studies will continue to build our understanding of the relationship between drug concentrations and clinical response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">In conclusion, the PK profile of the PDS is consistent with the durability and clinical efficacy outcomes observed in the Ladder trial. PDS 100&#x000a0;mg/ml continuously releases ranibizumab through at least month 16, with serum PK profiles that are consistent after implantation and multiple refills.

Many participants shared concerns about perceived lack of information about COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy. There were differences within each ethnic group, with factors such as occupation and perceived health status influencing intention to accept a vaccine once made available. Across ethnic groups, participants believed that public contact occupations, older adults and vulnerable groups should be prioritised for vaccination. Perceived risk, social influences, occupation, age, comorbidities and engagement with healthcare influenced participants&#x02019; intentions to accept vaccination once available. All Jewish FG participants intended to accept, while all Traveller FG participants indicated they probably would not.</p><p>Facilitators to COVID-19 vaccine uptake across ethnic groups included: desire to return to normality and protect health and well-being; perceived higher risk of infection; evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy; vaccine availability and accessibility.</p><p>COVID-19 information sources were influenced by social factors and included: friends and family; media and news outlets; research literature; and culture and religion. Participants across most different ethnic groups were concerned about misinformation or had negative attitudes towards the media.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>During vaccination rollout, including boosters, commissioners and providers should provide accurate information, authentic community outreach and use appropriate channels to disseminate information and counter misinformation. Adopting a context-specific approach to vaccine resources, interventions and policies and empowering communities has potential to increase trust in the programme.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>QUALITATIVE RESEARCH</kwd><kwd>Infection control</kwd><kwd>Public health</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source>

Many were concerned about perceived lack of information about COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy. Mistrust in government advice and recommendations was identified as the greatest potential barrier to vaccine acceptability. This was due to perceptions of the government&#x02019;s handling of the pandemic, perceived unclear messaging and frequently changing guidance at various stages of the pandemic which resulted in confusion. Disengagement with pharmaceuticals, medicine and healthcare services was a barrier to vaccine uptake which was mainly due to mistrust. A few participants had negative views around vaccination imposed by their relatives. A minority of participants stated that they would definitely not accept the vaccine, which was primarily due to being opposed to vaccines in general.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Facilitators for vaccination</title><p>There was general agreement across ethnic minority and white British groups on preferred places to receive the vaccine, including community healthcare settings and settings perceived as low risk, for example, a space with less people. Many stated that they would accept the vaccine either to enable return to &#x02018;normal&#x02019; life, continue working, or protect themselves and others due to existing health conditions.

This has been found in several other studies of the general population, healthcare workers, immunocompromised and parents.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 31 39</xref> Easy access will be important to facilitate vaccination uptake for those with risk due to occupation or comorbidity.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Our study and others certainly indicated that many would prefer a local, low-risk community healthcare setting with convenience of booking appointments.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 40 41</xref> However, at the time of our data collection, access to vaccines was not a tangible issue as they had not yet been approved. The importance of differentiating between vaccine hesitancy, which has less variation in different ethnic groups,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> and undervaccination related to environmental context and access has been raised by others.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35 43</xref> Locally appropriate outreach settings are needed with flexible appointments to overcome vaccine access issues. Migrants with precarious immigration status suggested walk-in centres in trusted locations such as foodbanks, community centres and charities would facilitate vaccine access and uptake.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Additionally, allowing vaccination without documentation or general practice registration should be considered and publicised to facilitate equitable access, for example, for the estimated 600&#x02009;000 undocumented migrants living in the UK,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> the homeless and other vulnerable populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Sources of COVID-19 information</title><p>Identifying sources of COVID-19 information could help inform intervention development and dissemination of vaccination messaging (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>). In our study, concerns about misinformation were raised across ethnic groups.

To avoid exclusion of typically under-represented groups, recruitment involved approaching charities that aim to empower and advocate for ethnic minority communities and improve their access to services. Qualitative research aims to gain as many different views as possible from the population studied. Therefore, it is not necessarily representative of the whole population, which would require a large survey. Our study specifically aimed to gain a range of views across different ethnic groups. Selection bias could have occurred, as those with a greater interest in COVID-19 may have volunteered. Furthermore, we did not reach every ethnic minority group in the UK.</p><p>Data collection was June&#x02013;October 2020 before COVID-19 vaccines were licensed. Attitudes to vaccines are highly responsive to current information around a COVID-19 vaccine, current state of the pandemic and perceived risk. Data collection was prior to much of the intervention work, putting the attitudes and intentions expressed in this study in a context of minimal community engagement and support. This captures a baseline snapshot of attitudes, providing the option to explore and assess the impact of such interventions.</p><p>Most data collection was undertaken in English, possibly excluding sectors of the population who may access COVID-19 information through different sources due to language. Similar themes were identified from the English FGs and Punjabi interviews, with exception of some religious views, indicating consistency of results. Much of the data collection and analysis was conducted by white British researchers which could have impacted interpretation of findings; however, FGs and interviews were held remotely which may have reduced this and acquiescence bias. The facilitator ensured that all participants were asked questions and prompted to speak. The first five FGs included a range of ethnicities while others mainly comprised participants of the same ethnicity. Both FG types yielded similar data, however.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Implications for clinicians and policymakers</title><p>Interventions and policies must be appropriate and effective for diverse populations where vaccine acceptability and uptake are low, to reduce inequalities and increase vaccine equity. This study&#x02019;s findings have local and national implications for clinicians and policymakers (<xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">table 4</xref>) which fall under three overarching areas: providing information that addresses specific concerns of communities; authentic community outreach; and using the right channels to disseminate credible information and counteract misinformation.

Surveillance should continue to monitor vaccination uptake, with both quantitative and qualitative studies to explore the needs of diverse ethnic groups and any ongoing disparities in uptake and whether they continue to be related to concerns in vaccine safety, perception of COVID-19 risk, trust, information sources or access.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e302"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2022-060992.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="d64e303"><caption><title>Author's

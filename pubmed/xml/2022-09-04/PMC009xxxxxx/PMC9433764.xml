Zhuhai CDC promptly carried out large-scale population screening in three nearby counties. A total of 4 COVID-19 cases were found in Nanping County. 34 cases were screened from close contacts, and 2 cases were reported from close contacts in other cities of Guangdong Province. The 20 cases were sequenced by Guangdong CDC and identified as the variant of concern (VOC)/Omicron variant BA.1. Since January 14, Zhuhai has carried out 8 rounds of nucleic acid screening for COVID-19 in the county where the cases occurred. Four large-scale nucleic acid screening tests for COVID-19 were conducted across the city, and no new community cases were reported after January 15.</p><p>In a total of 38 Omicron cases, 76% were mild (26/38) or asymptomatic (3/38) cases and 24% were moderate (9/38) cases; 79% of the mild or asymptomatic (23/29) cases completed more than 2 doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine; 83% of cases under the age of 15 were mild (15/18) and 70% of adult cases were mild or asymptomatic (14/20). There was no significant difference between the 2 age groups (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05).The main symptoms were cough (49%, 17/35), fever (29%, 10/35), and dry pharynx (23%, 8/35). Pulmonary inflammation was found on computed tomography in 16% (6/38) of cases, 17% (3/18) in children and 15% (3/20) in adults.</p><p>The outbreak occurred in a cluster of work and study places and families (<xref rid="Figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The first case (a 34-years-old female) who worked in Company C developed symptoms on January 8, 2022. Her husband was a yacht harbor driver, her daughter was studying in Primary School B, and her son attended Kindergarten A, all of whom developed symptoms on January 11, 2022.</p><fig position="float" id="Figure1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The transmission characteristics and transmission chain of an outbreak of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in Zhuhai City, Guangdong Province, China, 2022.

In Figure 1C, the red dotted line indicated <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>t</sub>=1, below which sustained transmission was unlikely so long as intervention measures were sustained, indicating that the outbreak was under control. The &#x0201c;R0&#x0201d; package of R software (version 3.6.0, R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) was used for the data analysis. Through gamma distribution fitting, the &#x0201c;EpiEstim&#x0201d; package was used to estimate the <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>t</sub> since January 12. <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>0</sub> represents the basic reproduction number; <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>t</sub> represents the effective reproduction number.</p><p>Abbreviation: COVID-19=coronavirus disease 2019.</p></abstract><graphic xlink:href="ccdcw-4-30-669-1" position="float"/></fig><p>We identified the outbreak was caused by family cluster cases spreading to kindergartens, elementary schools, and companies, then successively causing 7 families to have cluster cases (<xref rid="Figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The family secondary attack rate is 15.8%.</p><p>This outbreak has produced five generations of cases. The intergenerational time interval was calculated using the time interval of case onset, mean=3.37 days, standard deviations=1.70 days. The basic reproduction number (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>0</sub>) from January 8 to 21 was calculated (maximum likelihood method) as 1.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.8, 2.0). On January 13, the effective reproduction number was (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>t</sub>)=5.5 at the highest, then decreased rapidly to <italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sub>t</sub>&#x0003c;1 after January 19 (<xref rid="Figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>In the mainland of China, the first imported Omicron cases were found in Tianjin in December 2021 (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Zhuhai had had no local COVID-19 cases since February 4, 2020. The first infected case had never left Zhuhai within one month before onset.</p><p>Company C mainly undertakes the customized production of foreign dentures and dental membranes. The goods were imported by express delivery from Europe and America. The first case occurred in a customer service employee. She occasionally helped pick up goods in the receiving area without protection (without masks and gloves) from January 1 to 11, 2022.</p><p>On January 16, 670 environmental samples were collected from Company C, and 6 single gene positive samples were detected, of which 5 positive samples were from the working area of cases as well as their colleagues without disease, and 1 positive sample was from the inner packaging of imported molds on the first floor.</p><p>After cases were found in adjacent cities, Zhuhai rapidly carried out large-scale population screening in three nearby counties. Early detection and isolation has played a key role in containing this Omicron outbreak (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). If the outbreak in kindergartens and primary schools had not been blocked in time, it could easily have spread through the community and caused an epidemic.</p><p>There was no strong evidence to show that materials other than cold chain food were the infection source (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). We suspected foreign dentures and dental membranes were possible sources of infection by epidemiological investigation, and more studies will be conducted in the future.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author">Tan ZL, Chen ZX, Yu AP, Li XY, Feng YN, Zhao X, et al</person-group><article-title>The first two imported cases of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant-Tianjin municipality, China, December 13, 2021</article-title><source>China CDC Wkly</source><year>2022</year><volume>4</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>76</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.46234/ccdcw2021.266</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">35186373</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><label>2</label><note><p>Yang W, Shaman J.

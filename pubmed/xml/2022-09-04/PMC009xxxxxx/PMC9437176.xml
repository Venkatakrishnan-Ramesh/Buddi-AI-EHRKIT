</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par6">Uveitis is a group of inflammatory disorders that accounts for 5&#x02013;10% of worldwide visual impairment, largely affecting working-age individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is important to determine the degree of inflammation for appropriate treatment and to monitor the response to therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Traditionally, the standardized method of grading uveitic disease activity is based on non-invasive clinical findings such as anterior chamber cell and flare, vitreous cells, and vitreous haze developed by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the heterogeneity of vitreous haze and limited photographic views of the ocular fundus could hinder the precise assessment of ocular inflammation. Meanwhile, it is limited for assessment if the haze is mild, in particular, scoring 0.5 or 1 on the ordinal scale (4 being the maximum) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Other clinical signs of disease activity include decreased visual acuity, macular edema, and findings on fluorescein angiography (FA) such as vascular leakage and nonperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Visual acuity is not that sensitive to the improvement of inflammation. In the clinic, we routinely obtain ultra-widefield FA to assess vascular leakage in patients with uveitis, which primarily develops from the far periphery and then progresses to the mid periphery and macula with increasing vitreous cells. After treatment, the vascular leakage regressed to the far periphery. On the basis of our observation and previous studies, inadequate control of occult retinal vasculitis may lead to the inability to wean off immunomodulatory therapy, and long-term complications resulting in poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Though rare, FA could have potential side effects due to dye injection. The invasive nature of FA and the need for frequent monitoring of inflammation for proper management prompted us to find non-invasive alternative modalities of FA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">We have often observed concurrent retinal thickening in patients with a varying degree of FA leakage. A prior study reported retinal thickening in acute anterior uveitis without FA information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Whether the retinal thickening is associated with the FA leakage and whether it changes in response to therapy are not comprehensively understood. On the basis of this background, we conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the potential of the OCT metrics as a non-invasive alternative to FA for monitoring the inflammatory activity in uveitis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient Selection</title><p id="Par11">This single-center prospective study was carried out in Xiamen Eye Center between March 2019 and July 2021. Patients are included under three criteria: diagnosed with noninfectious intermediate or pan uveitis; presented vascular leakage at their initial visit; and were imaged with concurrent wide-field fluorescein angiography (FA) and OCT. The diagnosis of intermediate uveitis and pan uveitis is based on the SUN working group.</p><p id="Par12">The workup to determine etiologies of the uveitis was performed, including tuberculosis skin test, serological tests for human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis, and radiological chest examination. Human leukocyte antigen B27, rheumatoid factor, anti-nucleotide antigen, and angiotensin-converting enzyme were determined in intermediate uveitis. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging was performed in patients with neurologic symptoms.</p><p id="Par13">The presence of significant media opacities (corneal band-keratopathy, cataract, and dense vitreous haze) that resulted in poor imaging quality preventing adequate assessment of angiographic leakage and the acquisition of OCT-derived macular metrics were excluded. Eyes with comorbidities such as diabetic maculopathy, high myopia, epi-retinal membrane formation, and macular atrophy associated with prolonged inflammation were also excluded, as were eyes with infectious uveitis and choroiditis. Furthermore, eyes that did not have either leakage scores or OCT measurements at baseline were excluded from the statistical analysis.</p><p id="Par14">All subjects underwent a complete ophthalmic evaluation, including best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit-lamp examination, and dilated fundus examination for assessment of vitreous haze; and then &#x000a0;ultra-widefiled FA and concurrent spectral-domain OCT imaging. BCVA was evaluated by Snellen electronic chart (NIDEK RT 5100) and then converted to logMAR (logarithmic minimum angle of resolution) for statistical analysis. Vitreous haze was categorized as absent (none/trace) or present (&#x02265;&#x02009;1+). Other variables collected include age, gender, systemic treatment, and local enhanced therapy.</p><p id="Par15">Patients included had consented to take part in the study.

Vascular leakage was defined as increasing hyperfluorescence of retinal capillaries in the late-phase angiogram [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One mid- to late-phase image (at 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min) and a late-phase image (at 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;min) were chosen for grading retinal vascular leakage. Vascular leakage was localized by its distance from the macula (mid-periphery is anterior to arcades and posterior to the equator, far-periphery is anterior to the equator) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and by quadrants centered on the macula such that eight zones were created [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Within each zone, a value of 0 was assigned if no leakage was identified, 0.5 if leakage was identified in less than half of the zone, and 1 if leakage occurred in greater than half of the zone. Vortex veins, the landmarks of the equator, are visible when setting the UWF color images on the red channel (635&#x000a0;mm) on the Optos Viewer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

OCT image analysis was performed using Heidelberg Eye Explorer Software (V.1.7.0.0., Heidelberg Engineering). Segmentation lines for the internal limiting membrane and Bruch&#x02019;s membrane were determined automatically on volume scan, and retina thickness maps were produced.

By contrast, macular volume in 6-mm circle explained much larger variations, i.e., 56.2%, in leakage scores, and it gave a better model fit with smaller AIC and deviance values.</p><p id="Par30">Noteworthy, macular volume in the 3-mm circle also demonstrated a positive association with the leakage (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and it explained 45.8% of the variation in leakage scores. It was shown in the analyses of variance that the GLMM model with macular volume in the 3-mm circle was better than the model with CST (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), but less optimal in the model with macular volume in the 6-mm circle (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). This indicates that macular volume in the 6-mm circle may be a better predictor of vascular leakage scores (see Supplementary Material).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Correlation of Clinical Findings with FA Leakages</title><p id="Par31">We assessed the relationship between vitreous haze and FA leakage scores using a GLMM model with a binomial link. The leakage was found to be positively associated with the presence of vitreous haze (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), accounting for inter-eye correlation and within-patient correlation over time. Eyes with one-unit increase in leakage score were more than two times as likely to have vitreous haze present, after adjusting for time of measurement, VA, age, gender, and whether it had local treatment or not (OR 2.69, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).</p><p id="Par32">Furthermore, ROC analysis was performed on the basis of the prediction outcome of vitreous haze using leakage scores from the GLMM model, which showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 0.91 (95% Delong&#x02019;s CI 0.88&#x02013;0.93) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

Neither age (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.906) nor gender (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.216) was associated with the leakage scores.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">Although clinical examination is commonly used for monitoring the severity of inflammation in patients with uveitis, it is not a sensitive parameter for treatment adjustment in patients with mild (none/trace) vitreous haze. FA leakage, which is often present in intermediate uveitis and pan uveitis such as Beh&#x000e7;et disease, was found to be correlated with macular edema and decreased on enhanced therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. At the uveitis endpoint workshop sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Eye Institute (NEI) held in 2015 in Holland, retinal vascular leakage was proposed to be regarded as a fundamental sign of inflammation in addition to anterior chamber cells and vitreous haze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Our study demonstrated that FA leakage was a predictor or precursor of vitreous haze. In patients with uveitis and no or trace of vitreous haze, the inflammation of the vasculitis may be underestimated if not performing FA examination.</p><p id="Par35">One of the major drawbacks of the FA is its invasive nature. As an alternative modality, OCT angiography (OCTA) has already produced a better understanding of retinal vascular disease in a non-invasive manner. However, OCTA is unable to detect leakage from retinal blood vessels&#x000a0;and capillaries, which is the hallmark of vascular inflammation in uveitis&#x000a0;and demonstrate&#x000a0;the&#x000a0;breakdown of inner blood-barrier.</p><p id="Par36">In this cohort of patients with uveitis imaged with serial FA, we demonstrated that vascular leakage varied over time in concert with OCT metrics. MV increased during active vascular leakage and decreased with regression of leakage and can serve as a surrogate for FA leakage.</p><p id="Par37">A significant finding in our study was that the MV in the 6-mm circle had a stronger association with vascular leakage (accounting for 57% of the variation), compared to MV in the 3-mm circle (45.8% of the variation) and CST (39.5% of the variation). Actually, CST was defined as average thickness within the 1-mm fovea of the macula. It is postulated that patients with active vascular leakage could have a diffuse spongy appearance of the retina, resulting in increased macular volume without noticeable changes in macular thickness. The minor changes in macular volume detected using tracked retinal thickness map analysis on OCT were mainly attributed to the retinal fluid alteration. Thus, retinal fluid changes on OCT may imply vascular leakage.</p><p id="Par38">OCT MV is not an absolute proxy for FA, especially for the initial diagnosis of retinal vascular leakage. In our clinic practice, OCT volume scans were performed on follow-up visits. In the cases of increased MV, FA can be obtained to confirm vascular leakage and evaluate the severity of leakage. On initial visits, the non-invasive OCT volume scans may detect increased vascular leakage and therefore the inflammatory activity, which may have otherwise gone unnoticed (e.g., in the absence of increased vitreous cell or haze or OCT findings). We found that the qualitative changes in color topography (yellow, orange, and red in the thickness map) are helpful and easy to obtain in clinical practice (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">Compared with FA, the described method of using OCT volume scans to monitor vascular leakage has several limitations. Long-standing inflammatory macular thickening would result in macular atrophy or formation of epiretinal membrane, which were major confounding factors to MV. Epiretinal membrane is common in uveitis, with a prevalence of 48% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, this method could not be generalized to subjects with a prolonged duration of uveitis. There is another limitation of this study. The scoring system of FA only reflects the area of leakage but does not consider the intensity of leakage. At the same time, it is subjective by graders, which may comprise the reliability of our study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">In summary, we conducted a longitudinal study on patients with intermediate and pan uveitis who were imaged with ultra-wide field FA and OCT. Our study suggests that OCT measurements, especially MV in the 6-mm circle, can be an alternative or implemention for quantitative measurement of active vascular leakage in patients with uveitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40123_2022_558_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary file1 (PDF 456 KB)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par41">No funding or sponsorship was received for this study.

Its extraordinarily high market price as an aphrodisiac, and pressure in the natural habitats due to overharvesting and climate change, have attracted local and global media attentions. Despite the wide media coverage on various social and environmental aspects of the caterpillar fungus, a consolidated analysis of the news and featured articles about the different dimensions of the caterpillar fungus is lacking. In this paper, we assess how the Nepalese print media have portrayed the social, economic, governance, and biological dimensions of caterpillar fungus conservation and management. We conducted a thematic analysis of newspaper articles published for fourteen years from 2008&#x02013;2021 in seven national daily newspapers in Nepal. We used an inductive method to extract the keywords from the printed newspapers, resulting in 3,777 keywords from 681 news items belonging to eight thematic areas. Based on the similarities and differences in the keywords, the news items were categorized into eight themes: impacts of caterpillar fungus harvesting (28% news coverage), trade of caterpillar fungus (16%), general information about the fungus (15%), harvesting of the fungus (14%), governance mechanisms (14%), challenges to the harvesters (6%), policy gaps (4%), and institutional and policy responses (3%). We found that Nepalese media highlighted the socio-economic and environmental impacts of caterpillar fungus harvesting but presented less information about the government response to its conservation, gaps in knowledge and governance mechanisms necessary to conserve the fungus. The thematic analysis of media reporting can help in devising long term conservation and management policies of the caterpillar fungus, particularly focussing on the issues frequently reported by the national media.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Caterpillar fungus, Conservation, Nepal, Newspaper, Media, Thematic analysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Caterpillar fungus</kwd><kwd>Conservation</kwd><kwd>Nepal</kwd><kwd>Newspaper</kwd><kwd>Media</kwd><kwd>Thematic analysis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Ecosystem services, also called nature's contribution to people, are the goods and services provided by the natural world for human wellbeing.

These studies have highlighted the significant contribution caterpillar fungus makes to household income, the increasing trade and demand in recent times, the emergence of community-based institutions for caterpillar fungus management, conflicting tenure of the caterpillar fungus habitats, and anthropogenic pressure in its natural habitats.</p><p id="p0020">Interestingly, annual income from caterpillar fungus in <italic>Darchula</italic> district, Nepal, is higher than the district's annual budget (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Pouliot et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Winkler (2008)</xref> claimed that caterpillar fungus trade accounted for USD 225 million of the Tibetan autonomous region's GDP in 2004 (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Winkler, 2008</xref>).

News media are also a platform for analysis of critical environmental issues such as lack of regulation and legislation, and strategies for environmental protection (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kushwaha, 2015</xref>). The issues raised by media help to inform decision and policymakers on challenges and controversies concerning the environment (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Thompson-saud et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). However, failure of the media to accurately frame information and content may be problematic when covering environmental and scientific topics (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Boykoff and Boykoff, 2007</xref>). Media coverage that is either too alarmist or optimistic may enhance ignorance, build despair, monger fear, and create negative attitudes among the public towards environmental concerns (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Johns and Jacquet, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bombieri et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">In recent years, there has been increased analysis of media content and how the media frames news on environmental issues.

The way in which environmental issues are framed can be critical for their interpretation. For example, news coverage on the largest ivory destruction in history at Kenya in 2016 was portrayed by some media as a positive conservation action, while others reported it as harming elephant conservation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Braczkowski et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). News media can also be biased. For example, when covering predator attacks on humans, the media can provoke fear rather than provide insights into the cause of the attacks and possible remedies (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bombieri et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, thematic analysis of the media content can help inform how the media plays a role in prioritizing issues which, in turn, shapes public perceptions.</p><p id="p0045">The investigation of media coverage of caterpillar fungus harvesting provides an opportunity to better understand public perceptions of the socio-economic and biophysical implications of caterpillar fungus harvesting and trade.

We analyse how social, economic, governance, and biological dimensions of caterpillar fungus have been covered, framed, and communicated in the news from 2008 to 2021. We specifically focus on two aspects: first, how the media portrays issues surrounding caterpillar fungus conservation and management (i.e., sustainable harvesting); and second, whether issues raised through the media concerning caterpillar fungus conservation and harvesting practices are addressed through institutions and policies. It helps the understanding of how the media shapes public perceptions of the caterpillar fungus conservation and management. This analysis will translate messages drawn from news published by the media into relevant information for policy, scientific inquiry, and local level conservation planning.

We analysed 3 777 keywords based on 681 news clips from Nepali language national newspapers from 2008 to 2021. Those keywords were broadly categorized into eight themes that describe the media portrayal of conservation, harvesting, and the gap in caterpillar fungus policy and research in Nepal. The thematic analysis provides further insight into the issues that were highlighted by the media, potentially influencing what actions are perceived as necessary to support sustainable harvesting and the management of caterpillar fungus. The thematic analysis also enables policymakers to consider the issues highlighted by the media in relation to policy making and implementation.</p><p id="p0155">Unsurprisingly, the news reports show a higher news coverage on caterpillar fungus in hilly or mountainous districts where the fungus is found and being harvested; specifically, the western and far western hill districts. There was also a high number of newspaper article on caterpillar fungus originating from the Kathmandu<italic>,</italic> the capital of Nepal, as the newspaper is read nationally and reports on national news. Also, Kathmandu is the ultimate destination for exports and the international trade of caterpillar fungus in Nepal.</p><p id="p0160">Some notable events took place in Nepal during the study period that may have influenced the number of news clips during that time. Some of the notable events featured in the news related to caterpillar harvesting include: a) development of the <italic>Yarsagumba</italic> Management (Collection and Trade) directives in 2017; b) <italic>Yarsa Pupal</italic> festival at 4500 m above sea level in <italic>Rukum</italic> with attendance of key political leaders in 2016; c) the mega earthquake in 2015 during harvesting season; d) killing of a harvester by police in <italic>Dolpa</italic> in 2014; e) harvesters murdered in <italic>Manang</italic> in 2009; and, f) the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Prasain, 2020</xref>)</p><p id="p0165">A peak in news reports about caterpillar fungus was observed in our study for 2014, coinciding with the year police killed a harvester in <italic>Dolpa</italic> during a public demonstration for local rights to manage the revenue of the caterpillar fungus (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kantipur, 2014</xref>). The peak in news reports on caterpillar fungus in 2014 may also be related to the publication of field-based scientific studies on Nepal's caterpillar fungus. These studies documented the changes in community development due to a decreased volume of caterpillar fungus and therefore a decrease in community revenue generated from the caterpillar fungus harvest (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Thapa et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). The news connected with the scientific studies reported that harvesters' perceived a decline in the number of caterpillar fungus (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha and Bawa, 2015</xref>); that climate change impacts caterpillar fungus populations (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha and Bawa, 2014b</xref>) there was an increase in the number of harvesters in the pastures (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha and Bawa, 2014a</xref>), and, there was a change in the economic contribution of caterpillar fungus to mountain households (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha and Bawa, 2014a</xref>). Newspapers act as a bridge between science and society, informing societies about scientific research findings. Similarly, news related to overharvesting, unsustainable harvests, and resource depletion were frequently reported in the news.</p><p id="p0170">In 2009, another instance of news report on caterpillar fungus was when harvesters from Gorkha were murdered in <italic>Manang</italic> (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">BBC, 2011</xref>). Locals of the Nar village, <italic>Manang</italic> district, murdered seven harvesters from Gorkha districts who allegedly entered their <italic>Manang</italic> community pastures to collect the caterpillar fungus (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gyawali, 2009</xref>). Therefore, news reports likely increased because they were discussing notable events of conflict between state authority and locals and among local harvesters. Similar resource-based conflict of, <italic>Shauka</italic> (indigenous people) and non-<italic>Shauka</italic> conflict around resource sharing of the caterpillar fungus is evident in the <italic>Api</italic> Nampa conservation area (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Pant et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>; see resource based conflicts in Supplementary material A). Newspaper articles can provide information and evidence about conflicts on resource ownership, and because reporting conflict tends to garner more viewers or readers of news, these events explain the temporal increase in the number of news clips on the caterpillar fungus.</p><p id="p0175">Events that may have decreased or limited the news coverage include the COVID-19 pandemic collection restriction of the caterpillar fungus in 2020. Similarly, the year 2015 saw drop in news reports on caterpillar fungus. This is likely due in part to the timing of the harvesting season which coincided with the disastrous earthquake in Nepal; as a result, the harvesters stopped heading towards pastures due to the trauma incurred by the disaster (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Sejuwal, 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0180">Global warming is a stressor partly responsible for lessening the availability of caterpillar fungus (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hopping et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>), with scientific studies showing the impact of climate change on caterpillar fungus distribution and production (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hopping et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha and Bawa, 2014b</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yan et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). The decreasing availability of caterpillar fungus at low elevation and the shifting availability to higher elevations is reported both in scientific studies (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Yan et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>) and science-based reporting in the Nepalese media. The news media also reported the views of the local harvesters that climate change impacts caterpillar fungus (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Sejuwal, 2014</xref>). As reported by newspapers, a common belief in the harvesting districts is that the caterpillar fungus production is linked with the rate of snowfall and rainfall before the harvesting season. Newspapers therefore act as bridge of scientific communication between scientists and the public, making the public aware of scientific findings and showing how scientific findings can match public perceptions of change.</p><p id="p0185">Our analysis confirms that newspapers also act as a watchdog, highlighting the challenges faced by harvesters with a focus on the cold climatic conditions and harsh environments where caterpillar fungus grow, which can cause illness in harvesters and sometimes death. These issues concerning the physiographic and climatic challenges of caterpillar fungus harvesting have been raised by newspapers frequently in the news reporting and sometimes in the editorial section (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kantipur, 2019</xref>), showing the importance of the fungus nationally. Although responses to address such challenges have been reported to be few, media outlets are continuously following issues of low responses from government, such as the state unable to provide basic facilities for harvesters. Basic facilities include sewage plans and providing medical camps to support the health of harvesters and to prevent death.</p><p id="p0190">News related to trade covered the issues of illegal trade, prices of caterpillar fungus, the volume of trade and the need for adding value to caterpillar fungus by processing at the local level to maximize benefit. The reported decline of the volume of caterpillar fungus based on interviews of collectors published by newspapers also corroborated with the scientific studies (e.g., <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha and Bawa, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), showing that newspaper reports can also contribute to and confirm the findings of scientific studies.</p><p id="p0195">Socio-economic impacts highlighted by the media were the phenomenon of agriculture abandonment due to easy cash income from the caterpillar fungus harvesting and school closures. Since the economic return of caterpillar fungus harvesting is lucrative, many children have been involved in the harvesting resulting in school closure during the harvesting season. This practice of school closure during caterpillar fungus harvest season occurred mainly in the mountain districts where caterpillar fungus is found. Media outlets give attention to this issue every year, yet there has been no policy or program to halt child involvement in harvesting except some local restriction by the management committees. Such unintended consequences of caterpillar fungus harvesting have also been reported elsewhere. For example, caterpillar fungus has become a &#x02018;resource curse&#x02019;, even for Tibetan pastoralists, as harvesting has become a disincentive for students to attending school and has increased non-farm participation (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0200">The caterpillar fungus is economically significant for the household income as harvesters are dependent on the income generated from the harvest. This implies that the number of harvesters has increased in the pasture, adding anthropogenic pressure in the habitat. Since the species is a high value commodity, the increased price each year attracts more harvesters in the pastures. However, the informal transactions often in cash make it challenging to trace trade transactions which directly has an impact on revenue reporting. Our findings suggest that the media has not covered the agenda of harvesters&#x02019; camp management, availability of clean drinking water and toilets for harvesters, issues of solid waste (both garbage and human waste) management, and wood fuel shortage during the harvesting season - issues identified by the caterpillar fungus harvesting directives (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">DNPWC, 2017</xref>). The national harvesting directives has indicators that need to be adhered to by the caterpillar fungus harvesters. For the sustainable conservation and management of caterpillar fungus, camp management is crucial as the harvesters set their camps where caterpillar fungus is found. This results in enhancing negative impacts on the pastures such as the destruction of native grasslands and soil compaction. Similarly, management of solid waste amassed by harvesters using processed foods and drinks has become a cumbersome task in the high-altitude pastures. The local management committee often dumps and burns the waste that may negatively impact wildlife in the mountain regions as observed at <italic>Maikot and Rukum</italic> in 2019 (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Poudel, 2020</xref>) and in <italic>Dolpa</italic> in 2012 (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha and Bawa, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the analysis of news reports could also help to examine the execution of policy guidelines at the local level.</p><p id="p0205">Our study highlights multiple roles of newspapers in informing the public on the science-policy interface. Newspapers can be a bridge between scientists and society to communicate and confirm scientific findings, a watchdog highlighting the issues faced by local people, an informer to inform locals about policy change at the central level, and as a general source of information. Media reports are equally as important as scientific field studies in conveying information. Anecdotal information provided in news reports can provide a clue for further scientific research or can be used to validate scientific findings and vice versa. However, newspapers sometimes ignore or miss important issues. Unlike other studies, we did not find controversy around how the media reports on the caterpillar fungus. This might be because the issues around caterpillar fungus harvests are not as contested as topics such as climate change or ivory burning.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="p0210">Our study is based on the analysis of news published in national Nepali newspapers, which covers local and national issues. However, this study did not include news published at the local level or internationally. News published in local newspapers can be very important for understanding local issues. However, this is a challenging task and an important research question yet to answer on how caterpillar fungus conservation is communicated in local media and how that might build public perception. In addition, we did not include English newspapers published in Nepal. The Nepali and English versions of the national newspapers belong to the same media organization in Nepal, and the English version of the news is mostly translated from the Nepali version.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0215">Nepali media has covered issues of the caterpillar fungus widely. The news covered by this analysis incorporated major aspects of the caterpillar fungus harvesting, while missing some of the elements of harvesting guidelines drafted by the Department of National Park and Nature Conservation, Ministry of Forest and Environment, and Government of Nepal. The findings of the thematic analysis indicate that coverage of the caterpillar fungus by print media over a decade appeared to focus on resource conflict related issues and published editorials on this species to show the importance of the species during the harvesting season. Once the harvesting season is over, the issues remains silent. Furthermore, there was also very limited coverage of policy gaps, responses and challenges with coverage focusing mainly on the negative impacts of caterpillar fungus harvesting. While devising species management policies, a thematic analysis study like this would help policymakers address the agenda unfolded by the media. This will help to communicate the directives to local management committees and harvesters for sustainable management of the caterpillar fungus. Increasing the coverage on policy gaps, the state's response and challenges can be a positive step towards sustainable management of the fungus.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0220">Sanjeev Poudel: Conceived and designed the experiments;

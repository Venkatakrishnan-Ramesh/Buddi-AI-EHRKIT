Although surgical techniques may vary slightly, consensus was reached on several points, including the importance of posterior application of mitomycin&#x000a0;C (MMC). Panellists agreed that the PMS postoperative follow-up appointment schedule is reasonably predictable and mostly characterised by fewer visits than with trabeculectomy, particularly in the early phase.

Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for the development and progression of POAG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, reducing IOP is key to slowing disease progression and is critical for preserving vision and preventing further visual field loss in patients with glaucoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The first-line treatment for patients with POAG is most often topical IOP-lowering medications, such as prostaglandin analogues and beta-adrenergic antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, forgetfulness, lack of confidence, and poor tolerance often results in non-adherence, with reported rates ranging from 30% to 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Selective laser trabeculoplasty may also be offered as first-line treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. If medication and/or laser treatment does not achieve adequate IOP reduction, incisional surgeries are often needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Trabeculectomy and tube shunt surgery are frequently performed incisional glaucoma procedures. However, while these procedures are effective at lowering IOP, they are often associated with postoperative complications and frequently require follow-up interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS; also referred to as micro-invasive glaucoma surgery) procedures were developed as a less invasive alternative to traditional glaucoma surgeries, with the aim to improve safety outcomes and reduce postoperative management of patients. However, IOP reduction is often modest following MIGS procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As such, MIGS procedures are indicated in patients with mild-to-moderate glaucoma.</p><p id="Par9">The PRESERFLO&#x02122; MicroShunt (PMS; Santen SA; formerly known as the InnFocus MicroShunt) was developed as a subconjunctival glaucoma drainage device composed of poly(styrene-<italic>block</italic>-isobutylene-<italic>block</italic>-styrene [SIBS]), a highly biocompatible and inert material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In contrast to the XEN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>&#x000a0;45 Gel Stent (Allergan Inc., Dublin, Ireland) which is a subconjunctival stent implanted using an ab interno approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the PMS is placed using an ab externo approach to facilitate aqueous humour outflow to a bleb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Several clinical studies have shown that the PMS significantly lowers IOP in patients with POAG and has an acceptable safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Following these clinical studies demonstrating the long-term safety and efficacy of the PMS, the device has been available for clinical practice in Europe since 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As such, there are a growing number of surgeons with real&#x000ad;world clinical expertise in treating patients with the PMS. There is an unmet need to collate this expert experience to develop guidelines on all aspects of patient selection and pre-, peri-, and postoperative management of the PMS for patients with glaucoma. The Delphi method is a systematic and robust technique to gather expert consensus on real-world knowledge, using iterative rounds of questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this modified Delphi study, conducted between September and December 2021, we sought to establish expert consensus on the role of the PMS to treat patients with glaucoma in Europe.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Delphi Panellists</title><p id="Par11">Eligible panellists were glaucoma surgeons based in Europe with extensive experience treating patients with the PMS (more than 100 procedures) and with patients having at least 12&#x000a0;months follow-up (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S1). Panellists were invited via email and asked to respond in the affirmative if they wished to participate in the Delphi panel. Three panellists (APK, IS, and LAP) were invited by the sponsor (Santen SA) to form a steering committee (SC) to guide the development of the statements included in each round of the Delphi panel. One member of the SC was asked to act as the moderator (APK). The moderator critically reviewed questionnaire results and supported the development of subsequent rounds. To avoid potential bias, the moderator did not actively participate in the consensus process. In addition, the sponsor did not actively participate in the consensus process but reviewed the questionnaires to ensure technical accuracy and regulatory compliance. No patients were involved in the study and therefore ethical approval was not required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par12">This study used a modified Delphi method which pre-specified that three or fewer questionnaire rounds would be conducted. The decision whether to hold a third round was decided by the moderator and SC based on the nature of the results from previous rounds and an assessment of the potential benefits of holding this additional round. A virtual consensus panel meeting with all panellists was held following round&#x000a0;2 of the Delphi panel. This meeting allowed panellists to discuss statements that had not yet reached consensus and provide additional context and considerations for the statements that had reached consensus. Each questionnaire round was delivered through a bespoke web application for Delphi panels. This platform was designed to help enforce key methodological requirements for Delphi panels, such as preventing retrospective amendments to a questionnaire round once it has been opened. All responses provided during the Delphi rounds were anonymised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Round&#x000a0;1 Questionnaire Development and Distribution</title><p id="Par13">A targeted literature review (TLR) was conducted in July 2021 to collate published information on the PMS. Literature searches were carried out in MEDLINE and Embase (simultaneously via Ovid SP). The Cochrane Library database was also searched. Searches were date-limited from 2016 to present. The list of electronic databases and search terms used are presented in Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S2. In addition, a pragmatic literature search of professional society websites and non&#x000ad;peer&#x000ad;reviewed ophthalmology-specific grey literature was carried out to identify any relevant treatment guidelines, expert opinion and/or trends surrounding the clinical application of the PMS.</p><p id="Par14">Following the completion of the TLR, a teleconference call was held with SC members to discuss the results and to determine key objectives of the overall Delphi panel. Insights from the results of the TLR and SC discussions during this teleconference were used to develop the framework of the round&#x000a0;1 questionnaire. Questions were grouped into the following categories: patient selection and preoperative considerations, perioperative considerations, and postoperative considerations. The question types posed in the survey were Likert scale, yes&#x02013;no, multiple-choice, or scoping questions. Scoping questions were used to gather insight from panellists and to provide context that would be used to generate more specific questions in subsequent rounds. Answers to the Likert scale questions were provided on a six-point scale: strongly agree, agree, slightly agree, slightly disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree. For each Likert scale question, &#x02018;do not wish to answer&#x02019; or &#x02018;insufficient expertise&#x02019; options were also included. For each question, panellists were able to provide free-text comments to contextualise their response and/or suggest a change to the statement for the subsequent round.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Rounds&#x000a0;2 and 3 Questionnaire Development and Distribution</title><p id="Par15">Questions that reached consensus in rounds&#x000a0;1 or 2 were removed from the subsequent round. Questions that did not reach consensus could be restated or rephrased in the subsequent round with a view to increasing the likelihood of achieving consensus. Whether to rephrase or restate a question was decided on the basis of the distribution of responses in the previous round, the free-text comments provided by panellists, and the advice of the moderator and SC. Statements that were posed in round&#x000a0;2 but did not reach consensus were discussed during the virtual consensus panel meeting. To encourage elicitation of consensus, for each restated/rephrased statement posed in rounds&#x000a0;2 and 3 panellists were able to view their individual response alongside a chart displaying anonymised summary statistics and all free-text comments provided for the question in the preceding round. Some statements that did not reach consensus in rounds&#x000a0;1 or 2 were not restated or rephrased for a subsequent round. This decision was made by the moderator and SC following an assessment of the level of agreement/disagreement with the statement, the content of free-text responses, and overall value of the statement to the consensus process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Processing and Synthesis of Results</title><p id="Par16">Results were exported directly from the online survey platform and analysed in Microsoft Excel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The consensus was set at a pre-defined threshold of at least 70% of panellists selecting &#x02018;Strongly disagree&#x02019;/&#x02018;Disagree&#x02019; or &#x02018;Strongly agree&#x02019;/'Agree&#x02019; for six&#x000ad;point Likert scale questions, or at least 70% selecting the same option for yes&#x02013;no or multiple-choice questions. For Likert scale responses, &#x02018;Slightly agree&#x02019; or &#x02018;Slightly disagree&#x02019; were not included in the overall calculation of percentage of &#x02018;agreement&#x02019; or &#x02018;disagreement&#x02019; reported for a given statement. Instead, these responses were used to guide the approach to rephrasing the statement for the subsequent round, if appropriate. As such, for a given statement, the reported percentage of agreement and disagreement may not equal 100%, despite all participants answering the question. The consensus was not assessed for scoping questions or free-text responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Delphi Rounds</title><p id="Par17">The round&#x000a0;1 questionnaire was open from 27&#x000a0;September to 4&#x000a0;October 2021; round&#x000a0;2 was open from 20 to 25&#x000a0;October 2021; the virtual consensus panel meeting took place on 18&#x000a0;November 2021; round&#x000a0;3 was open from 30&#x000a0;November to 6&#x000a0;December 2021 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Several methods can be used to manage postoperative increased IOP levels, including steroids, NSAIDs, open revision, and bleb needling. However, revision surgery is preferable to bleb needling, except in the case of cystic blebs. Although corneal endothelial decompensation is an uncommon side effect of the procedure (on the basis of currently available data), it is nevertheless important to monitor this in a similar fashion as one would following the implantation of other glaucoma drainage devices. There was agreement that an unsuccessful PMS procedure does not preclude a subsequent glaucoma surgery with subconjunctival drainage. Panellists indicated that trabeculectomy was a possibility for this subsequent surgery, but that MIGS should not be used. No consensus was reached for tube surgery or a second PMS implantation in a different quadrant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">There are currently no standard guidelines on best practice for patient selection and pre-, peri-, and postoperative care management for the PMS in the treatment of patients with POAG. This modified Delphi panel successfully achieved consensus from a group of glaucoma surgeons with extensive experience using the PMS on aspects of best practice for the use of this device to treat patients with glaucoma in Europe.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Patient Selection and Preoperative Considerations</title><p id="Par28">Although the consensus panel agreed that the PMS is effective at reducing IOP in patients with high-tension POAG (greater than 21&#x000a0;mmHg), more evidence is needed to determine if the device is suitable for patients requiring the lowest target pressures. The panellists indicated that more evidence is also needed to determine if the device can be indicated for other forms of glaucoma and/or for patients with certain comorbidities, such as high hyperopia. However, there was consensus that the device might be suitable for patients with the off-label diagnosis of pseudoexfoliation, supporting recent research that has shown the PMS has similar efficacy for patients with POAG and those with pseudoexfoliation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There was consensus that it is possible to perform the procedure in patients with high myopia, but there was some disagreement among the panellists regarding this approach. Some surgeons indicated that they had experienced positive outcomes for patients with high myopia and, in some cases, better outcomes as compared with trabeculectomy. However, other panellists urged caution with this approach, citing experience of patients presenting with high myopia at possibly greater risk of developing complications secondary to hypotony. These panellists further detailed that it may be more challenging to treat patients with PMS postoperatively with anterior chamber injection of viscoelastic, as this can cause sharp increases in IOP due to viscoelastic not easily passing through the PMS. However, there are several potential mitigation techniques to reduce the risk of IOP spikes in these patients, such as modifying the type of ophthalmic viscoelastic device (OVD) used and/or monitoring the patient closely for changes in IOP. In addition, several surgeons detailed that another potential method to reduce the risk of postoperative hypotony is to insert a ripchord suture in a releasable fashion during the PMS procedure (e.g. 10/0 nylon or 9/0 prolene). Overall, there was agreement that patients with high myopia are at a higher risk of postoperative complications regardless of the type of glaucoma surgery, and therefore these patients need to be monitored carefully during the postoperative period.</p><p id="Par29">During the consensus meeting, the panellists discussed that in some cases it might be feasible to perform the PMS implantation procedure in patients who have had previous glaucoma surgery. Panellists agreed that to optimise surgical outcomes, eligible patients should not have had incisional glaucoma surgery or cataract surgery on the affected eye for the 12 or 6&#x000a0;months prior, respectively. However, a shorter time frame is acceptable in both cases depending on the surgical need and there are practical advantages to choosing the PMS as a second surgery. In the case of a failed trabeculectomy, the surgeon may not have adequate space superiorly to perform a second trabeculectomy, but there may be space to insert the PMS. Recent evidence has shown that implantation of the PMS in patients with POAG after a failed trabeculectomy was safe and effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, more data are required to ensure the safety and efficacy of such an approach. In addition, there was general discussion that it may be possible to implant a second PMS after a failed initial procedure. However, this decision is contingent on many factors such as the available quadrants and glaucoma severity; this approach did not reach consensus during the process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Perioperative Considerations</title><p id="Par30">The panellists agreed that for surgeons experienced and proficient with other filtering surgeries that require manipulation of conjunctiva and Tenon&#x02019;s capsule, the PMS implantation procedure (using an ab externo approach) has a short learning curve compared with trabeculectomy and tube surgery. As most surgeons are often already comfortable performing ab externo procedures, the PMS procedure is a valuable opportunity for widespread adoption to provide an additional treatment option for patients with glaucoma. MMC is recommended for use during PMS procedures to prevent excessive postoperative scarring and to increase the chance of surgical success. Surgeons also expressed that typically, their method of MMC use during the PMS procedure does not differ from that used during trabeculectomy (e.g. method of application [sponges or injection], concentration [typically between 0.2 and 0.4&#x000a0;mg/mL], and/or duration of application).</p><p id="Par31">However, there were some key differences among the panellists in their approach to MMC use during the PMS procedure. Some surgeons detailed that they have experienced consistently more favourable results when using a higher concentration of MMC during the PMS procedure (0.4&#x000a0;mg/mL) than the concentration used during trabeculectomy. There was agreement that surgeons may approach MMC use during the PMS procedure differently from a trabeculectomy, and ultimately surgeons should use the MMC concentration that, in their experience, works best. In addition, the consensus panel agreed that the condition of Tenon&#x02019;s capsule guided their MMC use and may influence the duration of MMC application during the procedure; however, some panellists indicated that they would instead alter the concentration of MMC used. Regardless of the concentration and/or duration of MMC used, there was overall agreement that posterior application of MMC is equally important for the PMS procedure as it is for trabeculectomy. Regarding other wound-healing modulators and antifibrotic strategies, such as beta-irradiation, 5-FU, and anti-VEGF, surgeons should approach the use of these techniques during the PMS procedure in the same way as they would for trabeculectomy or other filtering surgeries. However, the consensus panel agreed that additional data are required to demonstrate the efficacy of these strategies.</p><p id="Par32">Each surgeon has a slightly different surgical technique to achieve optimal results during trabeculectomy, and therefore there were some differences among the panellists regarding surgical approach to the PMS procedure. However, differences in surgical technique are to be expected and of no consequence if surgical outcomes are similar. For example, although surgeons may have different approaches to the conjunctival and Tenon&#x02019;s incision and dissection, the key outcome is the creation of a wide and deep pocket for the application of MMC and to reduce posterior resistance. In addition, some surgeons indicated that they closed differently between trabeculectomy and the PMS procedure. For the latter, it is crucial to avoid trapping the distal tip of the device in the Tenon&#x02019;s during conjunctival and Tenon&#x02019;s closure. As such, the Tenon&#x02019;s capsule must be sufficiently stretched to avoid occluding the distal tip of the implant, and the closure needs to be watertight.</p><p id="Par33">The panellists also discussed the safety and efficacy of performing cataract surgery in conjunction with PMS implantation. The consensus panel agreed that while it is possible to perform cataract surgery in combination with the PMS procedure, it is important to note that success rates may be compromised. Although there are promising preliminary data that show the efficacy and safety of a combined PMS and cataract procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], further data are required to further understand the efficacy of combined surgical procedures and to identify any factors that may compromise outcomes, such as additional inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Postoperative Considerations</title><p id="Par34">Overall, and in the experience of the consensus panel, the PMS has consistent and predictable efficacy outcomes with regards to reduction in IOP from baseline and discontinuation of glaucoma medications. In addition, for the &#x02018;typical&#x02019; patient, the procedure has a reasonably predictable postoperative follow-up appointment schedule, with fewer unscheduled visits compared with trabeculectomy, which often requires frequent in&#x000ad;person follow-up appointments. One reason why patients implanted with the PMS tend to experience fewer postoperative visits compared with trabeculectomy is because there are no scleral flap sutures that need adjustment or removal. With fewer overall appointments, the PMS procedure may be particularly suitable for patients who are unable to attend a high frequency of appointments.</p><p id="Par35">The PMS has a good safety profile, with minimal complications arising immediately after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Complications are most often transient, of low severity, and resolve without intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Specifically, surgeons indicated that, on the basis of their experience, corneal endothelial decompensation is uncommon in patients following the PMS procedure. However, it is important to note that current experience with the device is, on average, relatively short-term (2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;years), and endothelial cell decompensation is typically a late complication of surgery. To prevent any potential complications, it is crucial to place the PMS as far away from the corneal endothelium as possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p id="Par36">The modified Delphi method is a widely used, systematic, and robust methodology to gather expert consensus using several rounds of iterative questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This Delphi panel sought consensus from a diverse group of glaucoma surgeons from across Europe, each with substantial experience of using the PMS to treat patients with glaucoma. Each panellist brought their own unique experience and perspective to the process, thereby strengthening the overall results of the consensus. A limitation of the Delphi methodology is that there is often a high level of drop-off in participation between rounds as a result of the prolonged time commitment. However, this study was completed relatively quickly, with all three Delphi rounds and the consensus panel meeting taking place over a 3-month period. All panellists participated in each of the Delphi rounds and also attended the consensus panel meeting, ensuring that the overall results represent the experiences of the entire consensus panel.</p><p id="Par37">A particular benefit of the Delphi methodology is that statements are updated between rounds following participant feedback provided through scoping questions and/or free-text responses. For this modified Delphi panel, the statements included in each round were also reviewed by the moderator and SC to ensure that the statements were clinically relevant and accurately worded.</p><p id="Par38">One potential methodological issue with consensus processes is the tendency for participants to feel pressure to conform to the group view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This issue was mitigated by using an online bespoke web application that maintained the anonymity of each panellist&#x02019;s responses while allowing for rapid collection, analysis and dissemination of each round of results. Although the virtual consensus panel meeting that was held after the second Delphi round facilitated &#x02018;face&#x000ad;to&#x000ad;face&#x02019; discussion, this meeting was crucial to provide the opportunity for the panellists to further discuss and contextualise the results ahead of the final round. As the PMS is a relatively new device, there were a limited number of surgeons in Europe who had the required experience in treating patients with the PMS to participate in this study. Gathering insight from a larger panel of surgeons would potentially increase the robustness of the consensus results. However, the panellists included in this study represent a wide range of nationalities and each bring their unique background and experiences, thereby strengthening the consensus process. As more surgeons gain experience with the PMS and additional research on efficacy and safety is published, it may be beneficial to revisit the results of this paper to ensure that the consensus remains consistent with current knowledge and experience of the device.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">The study demonstrated that the consensus panel of glaucoma surgeons were largely aligned on patient selection and pre-, peri-, and postoperative care management decisions for the PMS.

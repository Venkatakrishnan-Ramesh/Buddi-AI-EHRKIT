Health care providers have been challenged to care for their patients while protecting themselves from this highly communicable disease. Anesthesiologists have been on the frontline of this pandemic as intensive care specialists, providing services in the operation theatre and airway management in emergency areas as well.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Not only graduates but trainees have also been actively involved in caring for COVID-19 infected patients. The disruption of daily schedules, the possibility of accidental COVID-19 exposure, and having dependents back at home, and thereby having to stay away from families have all added to the overall anxiety of trainees.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Along with its many effects on the health care system, economy, and emotional state of mind of health care workers, the pandemic has impacted the education and training system in various manners, especially for hands-on disciplines including anesthesiology.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>One of the first responses to the pandemic by various organizations worldwide was to curtail elective surgeries and appointments to conserve the limited human and material resources and to minimize exposure to health care workers and the general population.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This has negatively impacted the learning curve of anesthesia trainees by limiting the variety of scenarios and surgeries, the management of which they are a part of. The limited duration of the training period is going to affect the learning potential of residents, making every possible opportunity even more worthy.</p><p>Maintaining social distancing norms and minimizing contact is of utmost importance to control the spread of this pandemic. Group gatherings, teaching sessions, and conferences involving renowned people from the specialty are an essential aspect of the training process. Abrupt cessation of such educational programs was a widespread occurrence at the beginning of the pandemic. However, eventually, the concept of virtual classrooms and online conferences was nurtured. The immense technological orientation and adaptability of students and teachers worldwide have brought back the education system to some level of stability by continuing sessions through various online portals. Adapting to the concept of the virtual classroom will help continue imparting knowledge to the trainees.</p><p>Research work is an integral part of a training program. It is the process of shaping the future specialist by activities aimed at obtaining new knowledge, solving theoretical and practical problems, and self-education.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A decrease in the non-COVID-19&#x02013;related patient population, infrequent visits to OPDs, and scarcity of resources has affected the research work by residents. However, COVID-19 has also opened more avenues of research for medical trainees.</p><p>Having said this, certain amendments can be implemented in the system for the betterment of trainees. Owing to the limited number of surgeries being carried out nowadays, not all trainees get the opportunity to be a part of patient management. Broadcasting the interventions, procedures, and surgeries being conducted can help those not directly involved in patient care in learning through visual and audio aids. Achieving manikin-based, standardized patient, and virtual reality simulation sessions more frequently in small groups or through online sessions can help overcome the lacunae to some extent. Extending the training period by 6 months can help provide more opportunities for residents to learn and practice. Emotional stress that is being faced by all can be reduced to some extent by carrying out counseling sessions and therapies in the form of yoga and meditation at regular intervals.</p><p>This one of its kind pandemic has taught the world disaster response, resource stewardship, and the professional use of social media.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] These changes should guide amendments in the health care and education system to help shape the future of medicine in best possible manner.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" disp-level="2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author">

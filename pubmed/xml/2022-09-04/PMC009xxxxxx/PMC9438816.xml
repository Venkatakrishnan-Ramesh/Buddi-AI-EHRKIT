Risk factors associated with mortality have been studied, but this study provides insight regarding disease progression and hence help to plan rescue strategies to improve patient outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>This retrospective, observational study included all patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 from March1 to June30,2021 who died in hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the study period, 1600 patients were admitted, with 1138 (71%) needing ICU care. There were 346 (21.6%) deaths, distributed as 15.8%(n = 55) within 48h of admission, 46.2%(n = 160) in next 10 days, and 37.8%(n = 131) thereafter. This trimodal mortality pattern of distribution was similar to polytrauma patients. Patients were divided into categories according to time duration from admission to death. In our cohort, 235 (14.7%) patients required mechanical ventilation, with a mortality of 85.4%(n = 201). Tachypnea was significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.001) associated with death at all times; however, hypotension was associated with early death and low oxygen saturation with poor outcome upto 10 days (P &#x0003c; 0.001). Refractory hypoxia was cause of death in all three groups, while other causes in group II were AKI (28%), sepsis (18%), and MODS (10%). Group III patients had different causes of mortality, including barotrauma (9%), pulmonary thromboembolism (8%), refractory hypercarbia (12%), MODS (13%), AKI (10%), sepsis (7%), and cardiac events (6%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>While physiological dearrangements are associated with rapid progression and early death, complications related to hyper-coagulable state, lung injury, and organ failure lead to death later. Providing quality care to a high volume of patients is a challenge for all, but posthoc analysis such as air crash investigation can help find out potential areas of improvement and contribute to better outcomes and mortality reduction.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd> Causes of mortality</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>mortality</kwd><kwd>ordinal scale</kwd><kwd>trimodal peak</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Since the outbreak in December 2019 in China, coronavirus disease2019 (COVID-19) has affected millions of people around the world.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Epidemiological studies showed that 6%&#x02013;10% of patients developed acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to diffuse lung injury and COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS).,[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Yang <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] compared case-fatality rate (CFR) and rate ratios for patients with comorbidities and concluded that the older population had a higher CFR, but the young population with comorbidity should also be considered as a vulnerable group. Bairwa <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in their retrospective analysis of severely ill patients with C-ARDS suggested close monitoring of biochemical and hematological parameters as a clinical indicator for potential progression to critical illness.</p><p>C-ARDS develops in 40%&#x02013;96% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] There are regional and institutional differences in the incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for these patients, ranging from 16% to 78%, but is invariably associated with high mortality (upto 97%).[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] This wide variation in outcomes has many literature gaps and needs further investigation to be clearly understood. The high fatality rate reported from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) suggests that they contribute a much greater share of COVID-19 deaths.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It is not presently known whether this difference in deaths in LMICs is driven by erroneous reporting; geographical variation; differences in infection patterns, age, and comorbidities in the underlying populations; variation in treatment protocols; or training of health care workers in the management of crisis situation.</p><p>On literature search, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first and one of the largest studies from India to evaluate the causes of mortality with respect to the timeline of disease course for patients who had demise within the hospital. This study may provide insight regarding disease progression and plan rescue preventive and therapeutic strategies. Hence, recognition of factors both in patients as well as in the system may help in improving management strategies; allocation plans for potentially scarce resources, such as oxygen, ventilators, and therapeutics; improving patient outcome; and reducing mortality. It may also guide discussions with patients and families regarding the prognosis of the disease.</p><sec sec-type="material|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This retrospective observational study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the hospital (IEC No. 2020015), which waived the requirement for individual patient consent for participation. All consecutive adult patients (&#x0003e;18 years) with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (polymerase chain reaction testing of the nasopharyngeal sample or tracheal aspirate), from March to June 2021, who died in the hospital were enrolled in the study.</p><p>Data including demographic, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, radiological and laboratory findings were extracted from the institutional electronic medical records system by two physicians. Data regarding triage vitals, medical treatment including the need for IMV and renal replacement therapy, disease progression and complications with time and length of stay and outcomes including discharge, and mortality were extracted by manual screening of patient records. All parameters were rechecked for accuracy independently by two physicians, and any discrepancy was resolved by a third senior physician before the final analysis.</p><p>The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality with no time frame set for this outcome. Admission criteria to the ICU included oxygen requirements &#x0003e;6&#x02013;8 L/min to reach SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265;90%&#x02013;92% (non-rebreathing mask, NIV, HFNC, mechanical ventilator), respiratory rate &#x02265;30/min, lung infiltrate &#x0003e;50%, acute organ dysfunction as vasopressor support, urine output &#x0003c;150 mL in 6h, confused/drowsy state and patients at high risk for clinical deterioration.</p><p>Patients were assessed using World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 disease severity scale.[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The 8-point WHO ordinal scale classifies patients from ambulatory stage to hospitalization with mild to moderate disease to severe disease with intubation and mechanical ventilation and signs of organ failure till death. Three physicians in consensus considered the cause of death by using standard criteria: Berlin criteria 2012 was used to define acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in intubated patients. Non-intubated patients were assumed to have ARDS and die of hypoxemic respiratory failure if they were receiving oxygen support via high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive mechanical ventilation with PEEP &#x0003e;5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O atthetime of death.[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) was made following the standard KDIGO criteria that included an increase in serum creatinine by &#x0003e;0.3mg/dL in 48 h or a decrease in urine output of &#x0003c;0.5mL/kg/h for 6&#x02013;12 h.[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was defined by clinical or laboratory failure of two or more systems as stated by the SOFA score, which included individual scores of any system &#x02265;1.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Diagnosis of sepsis was based on International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock 2018. Secondary infection was diagnosed when patients showed symptoms or signs of pneumonia or bacteremia and positive culture of new pathogen obtained from the lower respiratory tract or blood samples. Barotraumas was defined as evidence of pneumothorax on chest radiograph or pneumomediastinum on CT images or subcutaneous emphysema in clinical records. Acute pulmonary embolism was diagnosed by CT imaging or clinical diagnosis along with elevated D-dimers and transthoracic echocardiography in case the patient was too sick to be transferredfor imaging. Acute cardiac injury was defined as a rise in serum levels of cardiac biomarkers above the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of the upper reference limit or evidence of new abnormalities in electrocardiography and echocardiography.</p><p>For comparison of the baseline status of this cohort, an age-based propensity dataset was created of patients infected with the SARS-2 virus who were discharged from the hospital during the same time period.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data regarding continuous variables were described in terms of range; interquartile range, mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, median, and categorical variables were described as frequencies (number of cases) and relative frequencies (percentages). A comparison of quantitative variables between the study groups was done using ANOVA. For comparing categorical data, Chi-square (c2) test was performed and Fischer&#x02019;s exact test was used when the expected frequency was &#x0003c;5. To determine the risk factors associated with mortality, the odds ratio was calculated. <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Providing quality care to a high volume of patients is a challenge for all health care systems; thus, many authors have studied the risk factors for the prediction of mortality, but few have highlighted the patient trajectory. Our attempt to analyze the day-wise mortality is important to understand the disease course and improve care for critically-ill hospitalized patients. As mortality from trauma is classically described with a trimodal distribution, with immediate deaths at the scene, early deaths due to hemorrhage, and late deaths from organ failure, we divided the patients who succumbed to COVID-19 into three groups according to the time to demise.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Reports of mortality among critically ill ICU patients of COVID-19 vary significantly from 20% to 62%.[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] We report an overall mortality rate of 20% among patients with severe disease. The majority of patients in our series required ICU care, and a higher proportion were on ventilator at the time of admission. This is because our institute is a referral center catering to a large population of north India. A study from Wuhan reports a mortality of 97% in patients on ventilator.[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] This high rate can be attributed to the lack of appropriate knowledge about the pathophysiology and characteristics of the new disease at the time of the study (March2020) at the beginning of the pandemic. ICU outcome study from central Florida reports that 80% of patients remained alive at the end of their study, similar to our results.[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Desaturation and tachypnoea are hallmarks of hypoxic respiratory failure with severe COVID-19.[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Our results are in coherence with this as these indicators were significantly associated with early death (groupsI and II). Most patients who died in group I had severe physiological disarrangements in the form of oxygen desaturation and hemodynamic instability; the rapid progression of disease after admission provided a narrow window to intervene to avert these outcomes. <italic toggle="yes">As cardiac and respiratory derangements often interplay, focusing on aggressive resuscitation by using dynamic tools of fluid assessment and vasopressor may have been helpful in patient management and improving the outcome</italic>.</p><p>The major cause of mortality in group II was refractory hypoxia followed by renal failure. According to our data, about 60% patients were ventilated in each group. As the ideal time to initiate ventilation in these patients is debatable, our results support that decreasing time to mechanical ventilation may not translate into improved survival. Another challenge encountered while managing refractory hypoxia in patients on invasive mechanical ventilation was increased minute ventilation and respiratory drives despite heavy sedation and neuromuscular blockade. There is evidence in the literature regarding a significant mismatch between the degree of hypoxemia and respiratory system compliance in COVID patients.[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This needs the understanding that there are different phenotypes of lung involvement in COVID-19 and the usual strategy of ARDS management may not benefit all. <italic toggle="yes">Thus, timely focus on lung-protective ventilation and optimizing personalized ventilator strategy might benefit patients</italic>.</p><p>Causes of mortality in groupIII were more related to complications related to hyper-coagulable state or lung injury (SILI/VILI/barotrauma) as patients in our cohort developed pneumothorax even on NIV or spontaneous breathing during vigorous cough episodes. There were 10 (8%) cases of pulmonary thromboembolism in our cohort. Among 18 (10%) patients who developed barotrauma (pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum), 10 were on non-invasive ventilation. High respiratory drive and large pleural pressure swings could have led to this. In addition, patient&#x02013;ventilator dys-synchrony as reverse triggering are also associated with increments of tidal volume that may induce VILI.[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Incidence of organ failure secondary to sepsis leading to multi-organ failure in our cohort was much less than previously reported. Sepsis and cardiac events have been reported in 100% and 52% of patients, respectively, as complications of COVID-19 during the first wave.[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Although some of these respiratory-related and infectious complications are preventable, at times, they are inevitable. This decline in incidence during the second wave could be from the lessons learned during the earlier wave.</p><p>Age has been shown to be a predictor of mortality by most studies; similarly, mortality in our cohort was highest in patients in the sixth decade.[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In addition, patients in this group succumbed to the disease early, with 62% of early deaths occurring in patients &#x0003e;60 years. This potential poor outcome can be related to immunosenescence and dysregulated host response in the elderly that leads to excessive viral multiplication and prolonged inflammatory response.[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Various comorbid conditions significantly add to the risk of mortality of COVID-19, with obesity having the highest odds ratio followed by chronic respiratory disorders in our cohort.[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Literature supports that increased BMI is strongly associated with severe disease or death.[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Obesity can also impair respiratory mechanics. A Brazilian study that reports diabetes and cardiac disease as risk factors for lethal outcomes had a limited number of patients with high BMI to perform an over-weight categorized analysis.[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] We also calculated the CCI for all patients, and our patients were equally distributed with regard to CCI among different groups. Hence, it suggests that though the presence of comorbid conditions increases the susceptibility to COVID-19, once affected, early or late mortality was not affected by underlying comorbid conditions; the infection itself plays the dominant role.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has limitations too. First, data were derived from a single health system, thus limiting generalizability. Second, due to retrospective data collection, there was about 16% missing data about comorbid conditions. Third, days of illness from the first symptom onset was not analyzed, and delayed presentation to the hospital can cause higher mortality in the early period. Lastly, post-discharge outcomes were not considered if they occurred later after discharge. Moreover, we did not compare patients this data of the second wave with that of the first wave.</p><p>Another missing dimension in published literature, including ours, which has complexity and dynamism very similar to ICU, is the SHELL model of aviation safety. The peculiar organizational aspects of the interaction of software (S), hardware (H), environment (E), and liveware (L) are known as the SHELL model.[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Each component has inherent falsies that can be substantial attributing to mortality and have not been discussed ever. The guidelines and algorithms that form the software were framed based on substantial evidence through fast-track literature and were changed very frequently. Hardware included the loads of equipment (ventilators) that were purchased on an emergency basis. Moreover, many health care workers may not have been exposed to work in such critical settings before. Lastly, the interaction of liveware among themselves through effective communication is paramount for successful outcomes and reducing medical errors. Looking into each of the component of SHELL model, as a posthoc air crash investigation, may make us wiser and capable of handling crisis situations.</p></sec><sec><title>Lessons learned</title><p>Suggestions to make the system less prone to errors and achieve improved outcomes</p><p>

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite limitations, the strength of the study is that we tried to analyze the disease course of patients who died in the hospital to find out events associated with severe outcomes. To conclude, our study is the first of its kind from the region to find out potential areas of improvement to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. This will help to contribute to better outcomes and mortality reduction.</p><sec><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author">

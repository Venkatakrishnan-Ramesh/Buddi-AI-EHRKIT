There is limited evidence regarding the side effects of the vaccines being administered. Hence, reporting such events may yield useful information in this regard.</p><p>A 70-year-old woman, known hypertensive, had frequent episodes of severe headache and transient loss of consciousness (LOC) without any neurological deficit for the past 3 years.</p><p>On April 6, she received the Covishield vaccine, a replication-deficient recombinant chimpanzee adenoviral vector encoding the spike protein antigen {Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2} {ChAdOx1 n Cov-19, AstraZeneca}. Safety data of the vaccine are limited in individuals more than 65 years and in patients with severe cardiovascular diseases.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Eleven hours later, she developed sudden headache, vomiting followed by LOC. She was rushed to a hospital where her blood pressure (BP) was 234/130 mmHg. Her trachea was intubated in view of the poor Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Also, she suffered cardiac arrest for which resuscitation was done. She was shifted to our hospital on April 8 with GCS-E<sub>1</sub>V<sub>T</sub>M<sub>1</sub>, her pupils were dilated and non-reactive and BP was 164/90 mmHg. Non Contrast CT scan of head revealed intraparenchymal hematoma in the left temporal lobe, midbrain, cerebellum, and ganglio-thalamic region with subarachnoid hemorrhage in bilateral parietal lobes. The neurosurgeons planned no surgical intervention. In our ICU, her BP ranged from 164/124 to 180/110 mmHg for which intravenous labetalol was given. Routine blood investigations and coagulation profile were normal. From April 10 onward, sepsis and multiorgan failure started to set in. On April twelfth, 6 days after the vaccination, she succumbed to her state.</p><p>An intracerebral hemorrhage is a focal collection of blood in the brain parenchyma. It presents with a tetrad of headache, altered consciousness, nausea vomiting, and focal neurological symptoms.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Hypertension is the strongest risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke. Controlled BP results in significant reduction in the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Sylvian Meylan <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported hypertension in nine elderly patients soon after receiving vaccine against COVID-19 (Moderna and Pfizer) of whom eight were known hypertensives. Before administering the vaccine, her BP was not recorded, nor was her post-vaccination BP monitoring done. She developed an intracranial bleed a few hours after vaccination. The likelihood of some component of vaccine causing such high BP and resulting in an intracranial bleed cannot be ruled out. However, there is no conclusive evidence for the same. Another possibility is that there is no causal relationship between the vaccination and her neurological status. According to the World Health Organization causality assessment of adverse event following immunization (AEFI), this case falls in the 1A category which states that there is inconsistent causal association of intracranial bleed to immunization as there is strong evidence of uncontrolled hypertension as the cause for the same.[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, no concrete evidence of hypertension and its complications following Covishield was found. Therefore, the population should not restrict themselves from getting vaccinated, but clinicians should practice caution regarding BP control and post-vaccination BP monitoring.</p><sec disp-level="2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" disp-level="2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" publication-format="print"><source>COVISHIELD by Serum Institute of India Pvt.

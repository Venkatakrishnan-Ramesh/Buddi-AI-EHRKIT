Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells are progenitor cells that maintain alveolar homeostasis, and their damage is assumed to be an initiating event for pulmonary fibrosis. However, the interaction between the lung fibrogenic microenvironment and AT2 cell dynamics remains to be elucidated. Here, we report a unique role of the lung fibrogenic microenvironment, where cell type-specific tissue reconstruction is achieved by exogenous cell transplantation. We found that in the lung fibrogenic microenvironment the AT2 cell pool was depleted, whereas mesenchymal cells could promote intact AT2 cell proliferation <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. Furthermore, exogenously transplanted AT2 cells formed alveolar colonies and ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis. Exogenous tumor cells formed tumor nests with relevant histological and transcriptional properties. Human primary cells were adaptable to this microenvironment, facilitating epithelial cell-targeted therapy in pulmonary fibrosis and the establishment of patient-derived xenografts for precision medicine in lung cancer.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020a"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010a"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010a">Severe bleomycin-induced lung injury causes a significant AT2 cell loss</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015b"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015b">Mesenchymal cells in the fibrogenic lung supports AT2 cell proliferation</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020c"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020c">AT2 cell transplantation ameliorates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025d"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025d">Novel orthotopic lung cancer models are established for patient-derived xenografts</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0025"><p>Cancer; Cell biology; Molecular physiology</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Subject areas</title><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>Cell biology</kwd><kwd>Molecular physiology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p id="misc0010">Published: September 16, 2022</p></notes></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0035">The lung is a vital and complex organ with multiple cell types specifically designed for efficient gas exchange between the outside environment and the blood. The alveoli, the most distal part of the respiratory tract where gas exchange takes place, are covered with two types of epithelial cells: alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. These epithelial cells are located in close proximity to other types of cells, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells, forming an alveolar microenvironment together with an extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fehrenbach, 2001</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Because alveoli are consistently exposed to various stimuli from outside, the mechanism of self-repair is important in the maintenance of lung homeostasis. Previous studies suggest that damage or dysfunction of AT2 cells, which act as progenitor cells in the alveoli (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barkauskas et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>), initiates profibrotic reactions in the lung (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Nureki et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Povedano et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Sisson et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). For example, direct AT2 cell depletion in mice leads to the development of pulmonary fibrosis (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Garcia et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Sisson et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), and mice with mutant surfactant protein C expression in AT2 cells spontaneously develop pulmonary fibrosis (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Nureki et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, mice with telomere dysfunction in AT2 cells are reportedly vulnerable to fibrotic injury (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Povedano et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). These findings support the causal relationship between AT2 cell dysfunction and fibrosis development. However, the dynamics of AT2 cells after exposure to fibrotic injury have not been fully elucidated, and the therapeutic measures for pulmonary fibrosis have been mainly focused on the attenuation of fibroblast activation, which results in the slowing of disease progression (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Rogliani et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Understanding epithelial cell behavior during the development of fibrotic lung remodeling would be helpful for regenerating alveolar epithelial cell integrity and for developing epithelial cell-targeted therapy.</p><p id="p0045">Lung mesenchymal cells are a heterogeneous population and create a unique microenvironment in the lung. Some cells, such as myofibroblasts, produce excessive amounts of ECM components and impair lung function in pulmonary fibrosis (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Sgalla et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>), whereas others have been suggested to contribute to alveolar regeneration by promoting AT2 cell growth and differentiation into AT1 cells (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barkauskas et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zacharias et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Mesenchymal cells are also associated with the tumor microenvironment. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Mediavilla-Varela et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), which secrete ECM, chemokines, cytokines, and tumor growth factors, are one of the key components of tumor-supporting cells. They contribute to tumor growth and tumor invasion through matrix remodeling and the secretion of various soluble factors (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Sahai et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Of interest, in pulmonary fibrosis, alveolar epithelial cell proliferation is also observed histologically (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Weng et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, pulmonary fibrosis is a risk factor for lung cancer development (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Karampitsakos et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). These facts imply that the lung fibrogenic microenvironment not only plays a role in progressive fibrogenesis but also influences local epithelial cell behavior in both reparative and pathological ways.</p><p id="p0050">Here, we hypothesized that the lung fibrogenic microenvironment has a role in alveolar epithelial cell dynamics. Using a bleomycin (BLM)-induced acute lung injury model, we evaluated AT2 cell behavior and the role of the lung fibrogenic microenvironment in alveolar epithelial cell regeneration in an <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> study and <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> 3D organoid culture. We also applied a unique AT2 cell transfer experiment <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> to elucidate the dynamics of intact AT2 cells in the fibrotic lung microenvironment. To further elucidate this microenvironment, a cancer cell transfer experiment <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> was conducted. Our data showed that AT2 cells in the BLM model were severely depleted <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> and were not responsive to the pro-proliferative microenvironment created by activated lung mesenchymal cells, which promoted the proliferation of intact AT2 cells <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. Intratracheally transplanted intact AT2 cells reconstituted alveolar epithelial structures adjacent to fibrotic areas, which successfully ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis. Similarly, lung cancer cells transferred to fibrotic lungs engrafted and formed multiple cancer foci, which led to the establishment of orthotopic lung cancer models, including patient-derived xenografts (L-PDXs). Taken together, our studies highlight the fibrogenic lung microenvironment, which promotes autonomous tissue reconstruction by AT2 cells and cancer cells. This information would provide a basis for novel therapeutic approaches in pulmonary fibrosis or tools for precision medicine and drug development against lung cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Low-dose BLM facilitates alveolar regeneration without alveolar collapse</title><p id="p0055">BLM-induced lung injury comprises epithelial and endothelial cell damage followed by alveolar collapse and aberrant ECM deposition in the lung (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hay et&#x000a0;al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Moeller et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Rock et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).

AT2 cells have been considered to be more damage-resistant than AT1 cells (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Herzog et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Hypothesizing that a reduction in BLM dosage attenuates AT2 cell damage and promotes alveolar regeneration, we created a low-dose BLM model, where the dose of BLM was reduced to one-quarter of that used in a high-dose model. In the low-dose model, alveolar structures were relatively well maintained (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A), as evidenced by the significantly lower Ashcroft score compared to that in the high-dose model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B) 21&#x000a0;days after BLM administration.

Although growing evidence suggests the importance of AT2 cell damage in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, the dynamics of AT2 cells in the lung fibrogenic microenvironment have not been fully elucidated. Our data provide a comprehensive understanding of AT2 cell behavior in fibrotic lungs, and the results demonstrate both quantitative and qualitative deficits in AT2 cells. On the basis of the interaction between activated mesenchymal cells and intact AT2 cells, AT2 cell transplantation facilitated alveolar regeneration by autonomous tissue reconstruction in the lung fibrogenic microenvironment, where lung cancer cells also formed tumor nests to establish an orthotopic xenograft model.</p><p id="p0150">One new observation reported here is that exogenously administered intact AT2 cells have the capacity for monoclonal expansion <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> in response to the lung fibrogenic microenvironment. Furthermore, three engraftment patterns of AT2 cells represent microenvironmental heterogeneity of fibrotic lungs, by which the mode of autonomous alveolar epithelial reconstitution is influenced. Barkauskas et&#x000a0;al. reported that endogenous AT2 cells have the capacity for clonal expansion after diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of AT2 cells <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barkauskas et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). We extended the knowledge in this area by demonstrating that exogenously transplanted AT2 cells also undergo monoclonal expansion and, in part, differentiate into AT1 cells to reconstitute alveolar structures in fibrotic lungs. Furthermore, this autonomous tissue reconstitution is not limited to AT2 cells. Both lung mesenchymal cells and lung cancer cells can reproduce their own tissue phenotype together with various types of endogenous cells activated by BLM injury.</p><p id="p0155">In particular, we elucidated that the lung fibrogenic microenvironment confers more relevant tumor formation properties to lung cancer cells. In contrast to LLC subcutaneous models, where homogeneous single nests of transplanted cell-oriented tumors were formed, tumor nests in LLC-BLM models formed together with endogenous mesenchymal and endothelial cells, autonomously creating a tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, compared to tumor cells in the subcutaneous transplantation model, tumor cells in the orthotopic transplantation model express alveolar epithelial cell-specific genes, such as surfactant protein genes. Similar to intrinsic tumor cell formation, the growth of exogenous tumor cells is affected by the surrounding microenvironment. This means that an inappropriate locus of transplantation may result in misleading results (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bankert et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bibby, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chijiwa et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Histological similarities between surgically resected original tissues and L-PDX support the notion that our orthotopic xenograft model recapitulates the original tumor features well.</p><p id="p0160">It is noteworthy that AT2 cell transplantation improved lung function in the chronic phase of the BLM model, suggesting a long-lasting effect of exogenous AT2 cells in fibrotic lungs. This finding is supported by the fact that exogenous cells maintained their alveolar-like colonies not only at the acute phase (21 dpt) but also at the chronic phase (90 dpt) of theBLM model. The lung fibrogenic microenvironment changes over time. In the chronic phase of the BLM model, whereas the level of collagen production returns to that in a steady state, the total collagen content in the lungs is still increased compared to the control, which might mimic human stable pulmonary fibrosis.</p><p id="p0165">There are several potential mechanisms to explain the effect of AT2 cell transplantation in fibrotic lungs. First, transplanted AT2 cells compensate for the loss of endogenous AT2 cells quantitatively by forming alveolar epithelial colonies. It has been demonstrated that increasing the number of AT2 cells prior to injury is protective against acute lung injury. Pretreatment with keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), a growth factor of AT2 cells, induces AT2 cell proliferation and ameliorates hyperoxia-induced lung injury (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Panos et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>) or BLM-induced lung injury in rats (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Yi et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). Second, the formation of alveolar epithelial colonies may help to maintain the epithelial barrier and alveolar structures. Together with this structural reconstitution, the secretion of pulmonary surfactant by AT2 cells (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Mulugeta et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) also prevents alveolar collapse, which then prevents the progression of pulmonary fibrosis (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Moeller et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Third, engrafted AT2 cells may modulate fibroblast function. AT2 cells were demonstrated to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and to suppress the proliferation of fibroblasts (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lama et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). The level of PGE2 is reportedly decreased in the epithelial lining fluid of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Borok et&#x000a0;al., 1991</xref>).</p><p id="p0170">In conclusion, we elucidated the processes involved in exogenous cell-specific autonomous tissue construction in a lung fibrogenic microenvironment. Taking advantage of this information, AT2 cell transplantation and orthotopic lung cancer models would be promising for epithelial cell-targeted therapy in fibrotic lung disease and precision medicine in lung cancer.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="p0175">Our study has some limitations. First, we cannot identify specific mesenchymal cells or humoral factors to characterize the lung fibrogenic microenvironment for autonomous tissue reconstruction. The essential factors might be different among cell types. For AT2 cells, a previous study identified a unique mesenchymal cell population termed mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs) (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zepp et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). These cells reside close to AT2 cells <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> and promote AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic>. MANCs were apparently located around areas of &#x003b1;SMA<sup>+</sup> myofibroblast accumulation in BLM-injured lungs (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Zepp et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>), suggesting the possible contribution of MANCs to alveolar reconstitution by AT2 cells. Second, it is unknown whether the general population or only a certain specific subpopulation of AT2 cells contributes to the resolution of fibrosis. Our AT2 cell isolation strategy for transplantation is characterized by depletion of bronchial cells to purify mature AT2 cells; therefore, the possibility of club cell contamination, which then differentiate into AT2 cells, would be eliminated (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hasegawa et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Alveolar epithelial progenitors (AEPs) identified by Zacharias et&#x000a0;al. and characterized by the cell surface marker Tm4sf1 (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zacharias et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>) are possible candidates. Recently, Choi et&#x000a0;al. identified <italic>Il1ra</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> AT2 cells that were specifically primed in response to inflammatory signals after lung injury to regenerate alveolar epithelial cells (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Choi et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), which may also play a role in our model. Sorting these subpopulations of AT2 cells may enhance engraftment efficiency and potentially maximize the regenerative effect, which needs further study. Third, the applicability of the L-PDX model was not thoroughly evaluated in this study. Although histological similarities suggest the maintenance of the original tumor properties in our L-PDX model, a comprehensive evaluation, such as transcriptome analysis or response to pharmacological intervention, would be needed. In addition, the establishment of an L-PDX model from more small specimens, such as biopsy specimens, would be clinically anticipated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>STAR&#x02605;Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Key resources table</title><p id="p0180">

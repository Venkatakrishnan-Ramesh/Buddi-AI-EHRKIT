By inducing T-cell kill of target cancer cells, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have improved outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is the current target antigen of choice for most CAR T-cell products under investigation for MM. However, their shortcomings deal with logistical and clinical challenges, including limited availability, manufacturing times, and toxicities. This article provides an overview of recently developed and investigational CAR T-cell therapies for MM, highlighting current evidence and challenges.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>multiple myeloma</kwd><kwd>CAR T-cell</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

Although hospitalization is standard after infusion, outpatient CAR T-cells are being delivered at select centers in highly selected patients. CAR T-cell manufacturing may take up to 6 weeks.

Therefore, it is unclear whether eligible real-world patients with multi-refractory disease will be able to survive during the waitlist and manufacturing period and experience outcomes as favorable as those reported in KarMMa and CARTITUDE-1. Nevertheless, multiple real-world studies suggest a benefit to the use of idel-cel or cilta-cel when compared to conventional therapies. A multicenter retrospective study assessed characteristics and outcomes of 108 patients with RRMM who had received standard of care ide-cel under the commercial FDA label.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Despite that 67% of real-world patients would not have met eligibility criteria for KarMMa, comparable toxicities were noted as well as efficacy with an ORR of 83% including 34% CRs and median PFS of 8.9 months (95% CI, 8.5-NR). Further, although there are limitations to indirect comparisons, multiple other studies have compared data from KarMMa and CARTITUDE-1 with patient-level or aggregate data from RRMM registries, revealing a significant benefit favoring CAR T-cells over conventional regimens.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;26</xref></p><p>Without direct comparisons, it is difficult to tell whether real-world patients benefit more from one commercial CAR T-cell product over the other. The KarMMa and CARTITUDE-1 studies enrolled similar patients with comparable baseline demographics.

More time and data are needed to better understand subtle differences in efficacy between ide-cel and cilta-cel.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Logistical Challenges</title><p>The most formidable challenges to the administration of ide-cel or cilta-cel are logistical, dealing with lengthy manufacturing times, limited manufacturing slots, risk of manufacturing failure, access to care and costs, as outlined below.</p><sec id="s0005-s2001"><title>Manufacturing Time</title><p>The manufacturing time of ide-cel and cilta-cel is around 28 days. For timely treatment, one should consider availability of manufacturing slots, timing the salvage treatment, pre-CAR T-cell work-up and testing and apheresis at the treating facility. In the KarMMa trial, all enrolled patients underwent apheresis, but 12 out of 140 (9%) enrolled patients did not receive CAR T-cell treatment.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Similarly, 16 out of 113 (14%) enrolled patients in CARTITUDE-1 did not receive cilta-cel.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The percentage of myeloma patients eventually not receiving their planned CAR T-cell treatment in the real-world scenario could be expected to be higher.</p></sec><sec id="s0005-s2002"><title>CAR T-Cell Availability</title><p>The approval of myeloma CAR T-cell therapies was met with high demand from patients whose disease had failed multiple lines of therapy. The bottle-neck due to manufacturing capabilities related to lentiviral vectors has led to limited slots provided at approved centers and delayed onboarding of other centers. At facilities where treatment is available, the treating physicians must choose which patients to offer a slot, which can pose an ethical challenge.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> They have to decide between those with the most aggressive and refractory disease who are in the greatest need but less likely to have a favorable outcome and those with less aggressive disease biology who are more likely to fare a better outcome.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In the future, the availability of more products would help supply meet demand, as could use of novel manufacturing methods such as non-viral vectors or allogeneic CAR T-cell products.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> At the same time, approval of agents in earlier lines will be expected to further strain the system due to higher demand.</p></sec><sec id="s0005-s2003"><title>Manufacturing Failure</title><p>The wide range of variability in lymphocyte count, lymphocyte function, medication use, mononuclear cell collection by apheresis and CAR T-cell manufacturing leads to risk of failure to achieve an efficacious product. Myeloma is associated with complex immunoregulatory alterations including a decreased CD4+ T-cell subgroup, enhanced T-cell exhaustion, increased T-cell senescence, and abnormal sensitivity to mitogens.<xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref> Prior use of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and current or recent use of corticosteroids further decrease T-cell yield and can lead to dysfunctional T-cells.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In general, for CAR T-cell products that fall out of regulatory specifications, a special program such as MAP (managed access program) may allow use of the manufactured product, under the discretion of the treating provider. Furthermore, supply chain shortages have provided constraints on treatment modalities, notably tocilizumab and fludarabine. When approaching CAR T-cell therapies under such limitations, physicians may defer utilization of CAR T-cell therapy until necessary conditioning and supportive medications are available. Conversely, alternative lymphodepleting conditioning regimens may be utilized, albeit fludarabine and cyclophosphamide have been standardly used for most regimens.</p></sec><sec id="s0005-s2004"><title>Access to Care</title><p>In the US, an important factor affecting access to care is the availability of treatment centers close to home. About a quarter of patients who received CAR T-cell treatment on trials for myeloma lived over 2 hours away.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Most centers require local stay for up to 30 days after CAR T-cell infusions and this is an important barrier for some patients. Many programs utilize grants, donations, or other funding to help overcome this cost, while local lodging resources such as Hope Lodge (provided by American Cancer Society) have made CAR T-cell treatment available to patients who cannot afford local lodging. The ability to have a caregiver can be a hurdle due to social and financial implications. A recent study utilizing the Vizient<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Clinical Database showed multiple disparities in access to CAR T-cell treatment on clinical trials.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Despite African Americans representing close to 20% of new myeloma cases, they made up only 1% of patients who received CAR T-cell treatment. Conversely, white individuals are over-represented in clinical trials and made up 65% of patients with MM treated with CAR T-cell therapy. Further, only 6% of CAR T-cell admissions were from neighborhoods with a mean income under $40,000, compared to 12% of non-CAR T-cell treatments, highlighting disparity in access to CAR T-cell treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s0005-s2005"><title>Cost</title><p>The approved myeloma CAR T-cell treatments carry a list price of $419,500 (ide-cel) and $465,000 (cilta-cel) for a one-time infusion. The cost of inpatient treatment must include hospital stay and specialized care, particularly in case of serious toxicity where the hospitalization can be both intensive and prolonged. Most commercial payers cover this treatment and often require a single-case agreement. In August 2019, CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) finalized the decision for Medicare to cover CAR T-cell therapies under FDA-approved indications. This important treatment remains elusive to the uninsured who represent 1% and Medicaid beneficiaries who represent 2.3% of patients treated with myeloma CAR T-cells in trials, in keeping with non-CAR T-cell treatments.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Clinical Challenges</title><sec id="s0006-s2001"><title>CAR T-Cell Toxicities</title><p>One of the biggest challenges of CAR T-cell therapy is the management of short- and long-term toxicities. Long-term safety data on ide-cel and cilta-cel are lacking; however, long-term follow-up and continued monitoring of patients who completed therapy is ongoing (NCT03435796) which will assess rates of late treatment complications such as second primary malignancies as well as other safety signals. Common BCMA CAR T-cell toxicities are discussed below.</p><sec id="s0006-s2001-s3001"><title>CRS</title><p>CRS is a systemic toxicity marked by an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and may manifest along a spectrum from mild nausea and fever to life-threatening capillary leak syndrome with hypotension, cardiac arrest, and end-organ failure.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> A meta-analysis of the KarMMa and LEGEND-2 trials revealed up to 80% of patients experience CRS, with 14.1% experiencing grade 3 toxicities or higher with a median duration of 7 days for bb2121 and 9 days for LCAR-B38M.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The rates and severity of CRS correlate with the dose of infused CAR T-cells.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Other risk factors for severe CRS include large baseline tumor burden, CRS onset within 3 days of CAR T-cell infusion, multiple medical comorbidities, and an elevated IL-6 level.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>While most patients can tolerate low-grade CRS, interventions may be required. The American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation CRS Consensus Grading requires baseline fever for diagnosis with a degree of hypoxia and hypotension determining subsequent grades.<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, was FDA approved in 2017 to treat CRS and can rapidly reverse symptoms.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> If rapid reversal does not occur, corticosteroids are also often administered. While most institutions provide anti-IL-6 therapy at the onset of grade 2 CRS, optimal timing and administration has not been established. Upon development of grade 3 toxicities, most patients will require intensive care unit (ICU) support. While early data have indicated that the use of tocilizumab or corticosteroids does not portend increased risk of relapse, the data are still maturing.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0006-s2001-s3002"><title>Hematologic Toxicity</title><p>Hematologic toxicity after CAR T-cell infusion can be complex and multifactorial with lymphodepleting chemotherapy largely contributing, as well as inflammation, HLH, infections, disease relapse, and secondary neoplasms including myelodysplastic syndrome.<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Furthermore, patients are often heavily pretreated, leaving them with limited marrow reserve. Among trial and real-world patients treated with BCMA CAR T-cells, grade 3&#x02013;4 hematologic adverse events are common and can be early (&#x0003c;30 days post-infusion), short-term (30&#x02013;60 days post infusion), and prolonged (persistent beyond 90 days).<xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Therefore, close monitoring of blood counts, prompt transfusion support, and appropriate supportive care with transfusion support, growth factors, and infection prophylaxis for severe neutropenia are required for prolonged periods of time post-CAR T-cell infusion.</p></sec><sec id="s0006-s2001-s3003"><title>Infections</title><p>As a product of lymphodepleting conditioning regimens, patients are at an elevated risk of acquiring serious infections. Moreover, this is not simply a function of the chemotherapy regimen, but the nature of BCMA CAR T-cells, which also neutralize antibody-producing healthy plasma cells and therefore induce hypogammaglobulinemia.

ICANS carries a heterogeneous and variable clinical presentation ranging from altered consciousness or cognitive impairment to seizures and cerebral edema.<xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Ide-cel and cilta-cel are believed to carry less risk and severity of ICANS relative to CD28 carrying CAR T-cell products as their 4&#x02013;1BB domains are believed to result in slower T-cell expansion which may mitigate ICANS severity.<xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> In CARTITUDE-1, the median onset of ICANS was 8 days after T-cell infusion and occurred in 17% of patients.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Comparatively, KarMMa observed neurologic toxicities in 45% of patients, 6% of whom received glucocorticoids.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Factors that appear to be associated with increased ICANS risk include pre-existing neurologic or medical comorbidities, high disease burden, early onset of severe CRS, and younger age.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Treatment of ICANS remains largely supportive and requires close vigilance for the progression of neurologic toxicities. Patients may require ICU level care with the development of progressive altered sensorium. Utilization of steroids as a treatment adjunct is common; however, optimal timing, duration and dosage are not established. Typical CRS and ICANS protocols call for dexamethasone 10 mg every six to twelve hours with tapering over two to five days in the absence of seizures or cerebral edema with the onset of grade 2 symptoms.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In the setting of early onset ICANS and utilization of tocilizumab, 1&#x02013;2 doses of dexamethasone are often given concurrently. While tocilizumab for moderate-to-severe ICANS is common, whether it decreases symptomatic severity remains controversial. While steroids are well tolerated by most, they may aggravate delirium, confounding the ICANS grade. A short course of steroids may effectively suppress ICANS without dampening CAR T-cell effectiveness.<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Seizure prophylaxis is also not standardized, albeit early levetiracetam prophylaxis is commonplace with the development of ICANS.<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0006-s2001-s3005"><title>Movement and Neurocognitive Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (MNTs)</title><p>Like ICANS and other forms of neurotoxicity post-CAR T-cell infusion, MNTs are heterogeneous with variable clinical manifestations. MNTs can resemble Parkinsonism, as they are characterized by movement, cognitive, and personality changes, including tremors, micrographia, memory loss and flat affect.<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The pathophysiology of MNTs remains poorly understood but may have to do with neuronal BCMA expression within the basal ganglia.<xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> However, carbidopa/levodopa did not work in an affected patient from the CARTITUDE-1 trial, and post-mortem autopsy studies have revealed intact substantia nigricans in affected patients.<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Unlike ICANS, MNTs have a late onset, long duration, normal immune effector cell encephalopathy scores, and poor responses to steroids and other supportive measures. MNTs have been found to occur after a period of recovery from CRS and/or ICANS and may arise insidiously. In the CARTITUDE-1 study, 5 patients experienced MNTs (5%), including one grade 5 event.<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> All five patients achieved a treatment response to cilta-cel. The median time to onset of MNTs was 27 days, and 17 days after recovery of CRS and ICANS. Patients who experienced MNTs were more likely to have a combination of at least two variables: high tumor burden, grade 2 or higher CRS, any grade ICANS, and high CAR T-cell expansion and persistence. Preventative, monitoring, and management strategies have resulted in a decreased incidence of MNTs across the cilta-cel program, and include enhanced bridging therapy to reduce tumor burden, early aggressive treatment of CRS and ICANS, handwriting assessments for early symptom detection, and extended monitoring for neurotoxicity up to a year post-infusion.<xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s0006-s2002"><title>Progression After CAR T-Cell Therapy</title><p>Outcomes after disease progression and optimal subsequent treatment approaches are poorly understood and require further study.

T-cell redirecting bispecifics do not require bridging therapy as they are &#x0201c;off-the-shelf&#x0201d;, do not require waitlists or manufacturing delays, and do not require lymphodepletion which carries risks such as prolonged hematologic toxicity and development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. Toxicities are similar, mostly comprising grade 1&#x02013;2 CRS, hematologic toxicity, and infections, but neurotoxicities such as ICANS are less severe with bispecifics.

As a result, multiple studies are assessing CAR T-cells at earlier times during the myeloma disease course, including after 1&#x02013;3 lines of therapy, after early relapse to induction therapy, and in newly diagnosed myeloma (NDMM). Some key Phase 3 trials such as KarMMa-3 and CARTITUDE-4 are comparing ide-cel and cilta-cel with standard triplet regimens for RRMM. Furthermore, CARTITUDE-5 will randomize patients with NDMM not undergoing ASCT to either cilta-cel or lenalidomide and dexamethasone maintenance therapy after frontline induction with VRd (bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone). Finally, CARTITUDE-6 will randomize transplant-eligible patients with NDMM to either ASCT or cilta-cel after frontline induction with DVRd (subcutaneous daratumumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone).</p></sec><sec id="s0007-s2002"><title>Improving CAR T-Cell Efficacy</title><p>Gamma secretase (GS) cleaves BCMA from the plasma cell membrane resulting in a reduction of BCMA-mediated NF-kB activation.<xref rid="cit0063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> As a result, increasing BCMA expression on plasma cells via GS inhibitors (GSI) has been shown to increase CAR T-cell targeted functioning in vitro and in preclinical models.<xref rid="cit0064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> Because soluble BCMA levels correlate with tumor burden and adverse outcomes, patients with lower baseline disease burden have better outcomes after CAR T-cell administration.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="cit0065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> A phase 1 first-in-human trial of escalating doses of BCMA CAR T-cells in combination with the oral GSI, JSMD194, in heavily pretreated RRMM patients was recently reported.<xref rid="cit0066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> Eighteen patients received JSMD194 as a run-in prior to lymphodepletion and BCMA CAR T-cell infusion, followed by 3 weeks of post-infusion JSMD194 treatment. Despite 4/18 (22%) patients previously receiving BCMA CAR T-cells, the ORR was 89% and median PFS was 11 months, which was greater for those with no prior exposure to BCMA-directed therapies. The ongoing KarMMa-7 study (NCT04855136) is a phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in combination with various agents including JSMD194 (arm B).</p><p>Preclinical studies have shown that culturing BCMA CAR T-cells with a PI3KCA inhibitor can enhance CAR T-cell expansion and persistence by increasing memory-like T-cell functions and decreasing differentiated or senescent T-cells.<xref rid="cit0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> The CRB-402 phase 1 study (NCT03274219) utilizes bb21217.

Toxicities were as to be expected, with most patients experiencing grade 1&#x02013;2 CRS and no neurologic toxicities. However, several patients experienced nail changes possibly related to treatment. Early treatment efficacy was modest, with 2 minimal responses, 3 PRs, 3 VGPRs, and 2 sCRs. All patients who received prior BCMA CAR T-cells achieved a treatment response. Another GPRC5D CAR T-cell product, OriCAR-017, is a CAR T-cell product with an additional proprietary Ori element that enhances expansion and durability. The phase 1 dose-escalation POLARIS study evaluates the safety, tolerability, cellular kinetics, and initial efficacy of OriCAR-017 in patients with triple-class exposed RRMM. Preliminary results have been reported on 8 patients, revealing an ORR of 100% including responses in 3 patients who had received prior BCMA CAR T-cells.<xref rid="cit0070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></p><p>Another potential non-BCMA target is CS1 (SLAMF7) which is highly expressed on MM cells.<xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> Preclinical studies of CS1 CAR T-cells have demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo anti-myeloma cell kill in mouse models, although expression of CS1 on CD8+ T-cells led to fratricide.<xref rid="cit0071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> Several early phase clinical trials are assessing the maximum tolerated dose, safety, and efficacy of CS1 CAR T-cells in RRMM. The CARAMBA-1 trial (NCT04499339) is a first-in-human phase 1&#x02013;2 study that manufactures SLAMF7 CAR T-cells using the virus-free Sleeping Beauty transposon system for gene-transfer. Similarly, the MELANI-01 study (NCT041426619) utilizes an off-the-shelf allogeneic CS1 CAR T-cell manufactured with TALEN gene editing technology to knock out the endogenous T-cell receptor and SLAMF7 expression to minimize the risk of fratricide.</p><p>Overexpression or activation of BCMA by its ligand, APRIL, promotes MM progression through various downstream mechanisms (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). CAR T-cells using a trimeric APRIL binding domain (TriPRIL) have enhanced in-vitro and in-vivo activity in both BCMA positive and negative MM cells in mouse models, and therefore might overcome antigen escape.<xref rid="cit0072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> Further, in addition to BCMA, TriPRIL CAR T-cells can also target transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI), a TNFR that is highly expressed on MM cells, thus offering dual-specificity. TriPRIL CAR T-cells are currently being studied in a phase 1 trial (NCT05020444).</p><p>Some additional potential CAR T-cell targets include but are not limited to CD38, CD19, BAFF, and TACI. Targeting of CD38 would be challenging given unclear efficacy after treatment with commercial anti-CD38 products such as daratumumab and isatuximab. Further, CD38 is also expressed on hematopoietic stem cells which could pose problematic toxicities. Although not typically thought of as a myeloma marker, CD19 has been reported to be expressed in subsets of RRMM cells that have a B-cell phenotype.<xref rid="cit0073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref> As a result, CD19 CAR T-cells have been utilized for treatment of RRMM after ASCT, in combination with BCMA CAR T-cells, and as part of a BCMA/CD19 dual-targeting CAR T-cell product utilizing the FasT CAR T-cell platform which allows for overnight manufacturing (NCT04236011), all of which have shown promising preliminary results.<xref rid="cit0074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,<xref rid="cit0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref></p></sec><sec id="s0007-s2004"><title>Allogeneic CAR T-Cells</title><p>Allogeneic CAR T-cells could potentially increase access to CAR T-cell therapy and overcome some logistical challenges associated with autologous CAR T-cell therapies. The phase 1 UNIVERSAL trial (NCT04093596) is assessing the safety, efficacy, and cellular kinetics/pharmacodynamics of ALLO-715 among patients with RRMM. ALLO-715 is a genetically modified BCMA AlloCAR T<sup>TM</sup> with a disrupted T-cell receptor alpha constant gene and a CD52 gene to minimize graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Preliminary data have been promising, with a median time from enrollment to lymphodepletion of only 5 days, and therefore no patients requiring bridging therapy.<xref rid="cit0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref> Among patients receiving dose levels 3 or 4, the ORR was 61.5% including 38.5% VGPRs, and median DOR was 8.3 months.

The two currently FDA approved CAR T-cells in RRMM, ide-cel and cilta-cel, have demonstrated unprecedented responses in a highly refractory population, yet are associated with challenges such as prolonged manufacturing times, limited manufacturing slots, the potential for manufacturing failure, need for bridging therapy and lymphodepleting conditioning therapy, and high rates of hematologic, infectious, inflammatory, and neurologic toxicities. Further, a better understanding of resistance mechanisms, outcomes and optimal treatment approaches after progression, and ideal sequencing with other anti-BCMA directing therapies are needed. Ongoing studies are assessing the efficacy of CAR T-cells in earlier lines of therapy, as well as novel targets and methods to decrease manufacturing time.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s0010"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors made a significant contribution to the work reported, whether that is in the conception, study design, execution, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation, or in all these areas; took part in drafting, revising or critically reviewing the article; gave final approval of the version to be published; have agreed on the journal to which the article has been submitted; and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0011"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The opinions and assertions expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the US Air Force or the Department of Defense.</p><p>None of the authors have any financial or non-financial conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>National Cancer Institute</collab>. <article-title>Cancer stat facts: myeloma</article-title>

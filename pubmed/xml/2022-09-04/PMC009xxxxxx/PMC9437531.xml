The key successful of the arthroscopic full-thickness rotator cuff repair has several suture techniques. First, it will distribute a tensile force throughout the entire tendon. Second, it will improve tendon healing by getting it closer to the medial anatomical footprint. Third, the suture bridge compression technique has been used to compress all layers of the repaired tendon against the bone with the total contact area. Fourth, it reduces the risk of cut through the rotator cuff and the rate of rotator cuff retear with a tension free repair. We used three suture limbs in one hole to reduce rotator cuff damage and the rate of retear and also only tie three medial row knots. The reasons are to compress anatomically the medial footprint. The configuration suture pattern consists of suture bridges that distribute pressure-tension over a larger contact surface area on the tendon-bone interface, allowing for robust tendon-bone stabilization, better tendon-bone healing, and less retear after repair.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Technique Video</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc1a"><caption><title>Video 1</title><p>This is a video demonstration with a full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear at the right shoulder. We use the main four portals to repair the rotator cuff tear. The first portal is the standard posterior viewing portal. The second portal is the lateral portal, which is &#x0223c;2.5&#x000a0;cm from the lateral border of the acromion. The third portal is the posterolateral viewing portal, which is 1&#x000a0;cm from the posterolateral border of the acromion. The fourth portal is the anterosuperior portal, which is 1&#x000a0;cm anterior to the acromioclavicular joint (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The glenohumeral joint is first inspected with a 30&#x000b0; arthroscope through the posterior viewing portal, and the subscapularis tendon, long head of the biceps tendon, and the glenoid labrum are inspected. After that, the arthroscope is placed into the subacromial space. The coracoacromial ligament is examined before the lateral portal is created. A complete bursectomy is performed with a 4.5-mm arthroscopic shaver, and the coracoacromial ligament is partially detached where the acromial spur is covered. The acromial spur and acromioclavicular joint were identified using RF ablation (The VAPR TRIPOLAR 90 Suction Electrode, DePuy Synthes). The distal clavicle serves as a reference point for completing acromioplasty and avoiding acromial bone over resection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). The arthroscope is then shifted to the lateral portal, where the cutting block technique is used to evaluate the acromioplasty&#x02019;s efficiency. The full-thickness rotator cuff tear is carefully examined for any tear patterns and the edge of the marginal tear. With bursal tissue attachment, we begin by gradually debriding the edge of the rotator cuff tear. Using a motorized shaver blade, the exposed footprint of the rotator cuff is decorticated, and a microfracture is made to promote in cuff repair healing. The posterolateral viewing portal was created on the acromion&#x02019;s posterolateral side. At the lateral portal, an arthroscopic cannula is inserted. The full-thickness rotator cuff tear would be ready for repair once the footprint preparation was completed. For anchor placement, we put two medial triple-loaded anchors (Y-Knot PRO RC (triple loaded; CONMED) as wide as possible between the junction intra-articular humeral head cartilage and the anterosuperior portal (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The retrograde suture technique is a simple and precise alternative that requires using a FIRSTPASS Suture Passer (Smith &#x00026; Nephew) from the lateral working portal to bite the rotator cuff tendon tear. The Ethibond no. 2 was elevated from beneath the tendon to above it. Three heavy strained nonabsorbable sutures from the same medial anchor are used to send the Ethibond no.2 suture (beneath tendon part) to the lateral working portal, and the Ethibond no. 2 suture (above tendon part) is brought to the anterosuperior or posterior working portal. The Ethibond no. 2 shuttle is then pulled out to the anterosuperior or posterior portal after those strands are tied together in one suture, and two sutures are linked together in different knots of the shuttle suture. Those steps are repeated in a similar order from posterior to anterior until four cuff penetrations are achieved. The first knot was tied in the same suture strand posteriorly of the medial row, the second knot in the same suture strand anteriorly of the medial row, and the third knot was tied in a different suture strand between anteriorly and posteriorly of the medial row (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). Although all six suture limbs of each medial row have been relayed, the two lateral footprints for anchor placement have been identified. From the anterolateral portal, determine the lateral row anchor location, which is immediately lateral to the bicipital groove and in front of the infraspinatus insertion. Sutureless lateral row anchors (MULTIFIX, S. ULTRA, Smith &#x00026; Nephew) are used. The anchor is used to pass the threads through. The anchor is placed via the cannula, while the threads are secured firmly in place, ensuring that the anchor slides gently over the threads. The lateral row footprint was cleaned by RF (The VAPR TRIPOLAR 90 Suction Electrode, DePuy Synthes) until it contacted the bone area. The anchor is hammered into the lateral hole until threads begin to enter it. The suture&#x02019;s limbs are then separately tensioned before each anchor is advanced into the cortex one at a time and fully hammered. The anchor is locked, so that the threads do not loosen after final tightening, and the inserting handle is removed. A knot cutter is used to cut the threads. The remaining threads are extracted through the cannula, and the threads are secured in place with a knotless and knot lateral anchor. The position of the second lateral row, with the suture bridge created using the same process. We recommend that the lateral row anchor be positioned as far as possible from both the bicipital groove and the front of the infraspinatus tendon to spread the contact area compression adequately (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). Reexamination of the medial footprint with an arthroscopic intra-articular view via the posterior viewing portal confirmed that the medial footprint was totally compressed and that there was no medial footprint elevation (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig 12</xref>).</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc1.mp4"/></supplementary-material></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Nowadays, the clinical advantages of knotted versus knotless techniques are still debatable, both in terms of clinical outcomes and complications. The ideal rotator cuff repair technique should provide both adequate biomechanical stability and a suitable biological condition in order to encourage subsequent tendon-to-bone healing. The suture bridge technique is used to secure the rotator cuff tissue to the anatomic footprint. Since the tendon tissue is not pierced at the lateral row, tissue strangulation by the knots is reduced, and tendon vascularity is preserved.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> While the biomechanical superiority of double-row repairs has been revealed, as it provides higher repair strength, reduced gap formation, and wider footprint restoration.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Alternatively, no knot tying in the medial row will reduce excessive strain and tendon strangulation, improve medial row integrity, and prevent retear rate (type II retear) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> When using the double row with knot tying suture bridge technique, the most torn tendon is at the medial to a heal footprint, referred to as a type II tear.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> After finishing a knotless suture bridge repair, we determined that intra-articular reexamination has a higher insufficiency and distributes the compression medial footprint. Subsequently, the tendon to bone healing of the medial footprint has a poor healing result (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Our technique consists of a hybrid of knotless and knotted suture bridge repair techniques, within each combination of advantages and disadvantages. The principles of the 3-in-1 hybrid suture bridge technique are a tension-free repair which leads to less damage to rotator cuff tissue, less strangulation, less blood supply disturbance, less operative time, and a completely compressed medial contact area footprint.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>MRI T2 coronal imaging at right shoulder.

A suture hook is initially punctured 1.5&#x000a0;cm medial from the torn bursal margin from the posterior portal. After the antegrade suture technique has pierced the entire layer of the cuff, the point of the suture hook is guided to the torn edge, and the PDS suture is relayed. The lateral working portal is then carried out to the margin of the PDS suture. Three heavy strained nonabsorbable sutures are recovered to the lateral portal from the same medial anchor. The PDS shuttle is then relayed to the posterior portal after those strands are tied together in one suture, and two sutures are knotted together in different knots of the shuttle suture. Using a cuff suture passer, make a second penetration hole about 1&#x000a0;cm from the first.

<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc1"><caption><title>Video 1</title><p>This is a video demonstration with a full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear at the right shoulder. We use the main four portals to repair the rotator cuff tear. The first portal is the standard posterior viewing portal. The second portal is the lateral portal, which is &#x0223c;2.5&#x000a0;cm from the lateral border of the acromion. The third portal is the posterolateral viewing portal, which is 1&#x000a0;cm from the posterolateral border of the acromion. The fourth portal is the anterosuperior portal, which is 1&#x000a0;cm anterior to the acromioclavicular joint (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The glenohumeral joint is first inspected with a 30&#x000b0; arthroscope through the posterior viewing portal, and the subscapularis tendon, long head of the biceps tendon, and the glenoid labrum are inspected. After that, the arthroscope is placed into the subacromial space. The coracoacromial ligament is examined before the lateral portal is created. A complete bursectomy is performed with a 4.5-mm arthroscopic shaver, and the coracoacromial ligament is partially detached where the acromial spur is covered. The acromial spur and acromioclavicular joint were identified using RF ablation (The VAPR TRIPOLAR 90 Suction Electrode, DePuy Synthes). The distal clavicle serves as a reference point for completing acromioplasty and avoiding acromial bone over resection (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). The arthroscope is then shifted to the lateral portal, where the cutting block technique is used to evaluate the acromioplasty&#x02019;s efficiency. The full-thickness rotator cuff tear is carefully examined for any tear patterns and the edge of the marginal tear. With bursal tissue attachment, we begin by gradually debriding the edge of the rotator cuff tear. Using a motorized shaver blade, the exposed footprint of the rotator cuff is decorticated, and a microfracture is made to promote in cuff repair healing. The posterolateral viewing portal was created on the acromion&#x02019;s posterolateral side. At the lateral portal, an arthroscopic cannula is inserted. The full-thickness rotator cuff tear would be ready for repair once the footprint preparation was completed. Two triple loaded anchors (Y-Knot PRO RC (triple loaded; CONMED) are inserted through the anterosuperior portal as far apart as possible at the near intra-articular humeral head cartilage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The retrograde suture technique is a simple and precise alternative that requires using a FIRSTPASS Suture Passer (Smith &#x00026; Nephew) from the lateral working portal to bite the rotator cuff tendon tear. The Ethibond no. 2 was elevated from beneath the tendon to above it. Three heavy strained nonabsorbable sutures from the same medial anchor are used to send the Ethibond no.2 suture (beneath tendon part) to the lateral working portal, and the Ethibond no. 2 suture (above tendon part) is brought to the anterosuperior or posterior working portal. The Ethibond no. 2 shuttle is then pulled out to the anterosuperior or posterior portal after those strands are tied together in one suture, and two sutures are linked together in different knots of the shuttle suture. Those steps are repeated in a similar order from posterior to anterior until four cuff penetrations are achieved. The first knot was tied in the same suture strand posteriorly of the medial row, the second knot in the same suture strand anteriorly of the medial row, and the third knot was tied in a different suture strand between anteriorly and posteriorly of the medial row (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). Although all six suture limbs of each medial row have been relayed, the two lateral footprints for anchor placement have been identified. From the anterolateral portal, determine the lateral row anchor location, which is immediately lateral to the bicipital groove and in front of the infraspinatus insertion. Sutureless lateral row anchors (MULTIFIX, S. ULTRA, Smith &#x00026; Nephew) are used. The anchor is used to pass the threads through. The anchor is placed via the cannula, while the threads are secured firmly in place, ensuring that the anchor slides gently over the threads. The lateral row footprint was cleaned by RF (The VAPR TRIPOLAR 90 Suction Electrode, DePuy Synthes) until it contacted the bone area. The anchor is hammered into the lateral hole until threads begin to enter it. The suture&#x02019;s limbs are then separately tensioned before each anchor is advanced into the cortex one at a time and fully hammered. The anchor is locked, so that the threads do not loosen after final tightening, and the inserting handle is removed. A knot cutter is used to cut the threads. The remaining threads are extracted through the cannula, and the threads are secured in place with a knotless and knot lateral anchor. The position of the second lateral row, with the suture bridge created using the same process. We recommend that the lateral row anchor be positioned as far as possible from both the bicipital groove and the front of the infraspinatus tendon to spread the contact area compression adequately (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). Reexamination of the medial footprint with an arthroscopic intra-articular view via the posterior viewing portal confirmed that the medial footprint was totally compressed and that there was no medial footprint elevation (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig 12</xref>).</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc1.mp4"/></supplementary-material>

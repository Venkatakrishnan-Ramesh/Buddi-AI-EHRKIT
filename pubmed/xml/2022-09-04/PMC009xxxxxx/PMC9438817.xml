Due to resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV, MERS and Influenza virus, airborne mode of transmission was emphasized. Anesthesiologists are involved with aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) resulting in high risk of infection to healthcare workers (HCWs) on a daily basis.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Various policies across the globe were proposed like minimizing crowding in operation theatres (OTs), hand hygiene (HH) to reduce the contact transmission, use of N95 masks for HCWs in close contact with AGPs, and modification of anesthesia practices to minimize or to contain the viral spread. Strong evidence to support the route of transmission was lacking but in view of the fatalities and disabilities due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, all possible precautions were implemented. Despite the availability of personal protective equipments (PPEs), there was anxiety[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and reluctance in complying toward the optimal PPEs usage,[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] anesthesia technique modifications, probably due to emerging disease unfolding different aspects and understanding toward the disease, discomfort while using the PPEs, lack of discipline, and inability to adjust to new protocols were a few reasons for the reduced compliance among frontline workers. Primary aim of the study was to evaluate the compliance toward the usage of PPEs and secondary aim was to evaluate the compliance toward the modification of anesthesia techniques to minimize the spread of virus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>We observed AGPs in OTs and remote areas of anesthesia like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suites, gastroscopy rooms, catheterization laboratories for HH, appropriate use of PPEs, and modification in anesthesia practice during the first wave of COVID-19pandemic after institutional research board (IRB) approval (IRB No. 12872/dated 15-06-2020). Our study was done in the Department of Anesthesiology, in a tertiary care center, in southern India, for a period of 10 days. No similar study was done as this is an unprecedented situation, so our sample size included all AGPs done (218) during the study period. We also evaluated rate of preoperative testing of patients, usage of masks among patients perioperatively, and limiting the total number of personnel while performing AGPs. The participants in the study were consultants and trainee anesthesiologists. Trained anesthesia technicians observed all the AGPs as per proforma.</p><p>With the onset of pandemic, anesthesiologists were updated via online talks, e-modules, and video demonstrations regarding institutional recommendations on HH, utilization, and proper disposal of PPE, as well as the department policy on anesthesia modifications to prevent the viral spread. Our institutional recommendations were based on Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] which were modified to suit our needs. A departmental core team was constituted to draft the protocol for PPE usage and modification of anesthesia technique for ensuring the safety of HCWs in OT and at the same time making sure the judicious use of PPE for our set up. The technicians were then trained by the investigating team to directly observe the parameters in a standard way. Pilot study on 10 patients helped in the development of the final proforma to document the findings, and the findings of the pilot study were not included in the final data analysis. AGPs encountered by the anesthesiologists are preoxygenation, intubation, nasogastric tube placement, extubation, tracheostomy, gastroscopy, endotracheal suctioning, and colonoscopy. For the purpose of our study, we observed preoxygenation, intubation, and extubation as representative of AGPs. In our institution, adequate PPEs, alcohol-based hand rub, and soap were available to all the HCWs throughout the pandemic period. The available PPEs included a surgical hood, head cap, surgical mask, N95 mask, goggles, face shields, visors, impermeable surgical gown, foot cover, and gloves. To minimize the spread of the virus, acrylic boxes, video laryngoscopes, and transparent plastic sheets were used to cover the patient&#x02019;s upper part of the body during AGPs. Modified anesthesia techniques such as rapid sequence intubation (RSI), avoidance of bag and mask ventilation (BMV), and deep extubation were also preferred over the routine practices.</p><p>The AGPs of elective procedures conducted during regular working hours were included. Patients with the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status IV, difficult airway, untested for SARS-CoV-2, and emergency cases were excluded from the study. We defined recommended and desired HH times for standardization of the observation. Both hand washes with antimicrobial soap and alcohol-based hand rub along with change of gloves were considered as an optimal hygienic approach. Hand wash for 20 s at least three times at first contact with the patient, after AGPs, and after extubation was considered recommended, whereas seven times per procedure (before patient receiving, after shifting to OT table, before AGPs, after AGPs, during surgery, before extubation and before shifting to recovery) was considered desirable. For the purpose of the study, recommended HH is acceptable.</p><p>Data entry were done using EPI Data 3.1. Data analysis were done using a statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) 21.0. Descriptive statistics were reported using mean &#x000b1; SD (standard deviation) for continuous variables. Categorical variables were reported using frequency and percentage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 218 elective anesthetic procedures were observed of which 95.4% were conducted in OTs.

To improve the compliance regarding patients wearing face masks, checking the presence of surgical mask on patients, was added to WHO checklist. Only 50% of the immediate postoperative patients were shifted out of OT to post anesthesia care unit (PACU) with surgical face masks and 3.2% of our patients were shifted intubated to ICU. The probable reasons have been 59.2% of extubations were deep requiring oral airways to prevent obstruction and to be able to give suction immediately in case the situation arises.</p><p>HH is the most important method to prevent healthcare-associated infections (HAI). For the purpose of this study, the HH meant either a hand wash or change of gloves after the unclean procedure or touching unclean surfaces. In our study, 55.9% of anesthesiologists maintained minimum criteria of HH compliance, which meant hand cleaning before receiving the patients, after AGP, and after extubation. Only 0.9% followed the institutional desirable number of standard HH practices, which was approximately seven times per patient during surgery. Compliance for HH during intubation was 41.8%, whereas 37.7% after extubation, which was similar to study of Sagar <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. 2020.[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Less compliance to HH could be due to managing COVID-19 negative cases, time constraints, stress, and unwillingness to apply knowledge into practice.</p><p>During non-COVID-19 times, we noticed the presence of four to seven HCWs at the time of AGPs routinely. To reduce the chance of spread of infection, the department recommended a minimum number of HCWs in OTs as protocol. Acceptable number of HCW allowed at the time of AGPs were three that included anesthesiologist, technician, and a floor nurse. We noticed compliance for a limited number of HCW was as low as 38.9% at intubation and 41.2% at extubation for adult patients, whereas similar percentage continued to have a regular number of HCW inside the OT. In pediatric patients, probably needed more personnel compliance was only 13%.</p><p>PPE can reduce the risk of the spread of infection by covering the exposed body parts. As a part of prevention strategies for AGP performers, the PPE recommended[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and provided by the department were N95, visor, goggles, surgical gown, clean gloves, and head hood. N95 respirators, named for their ability to filter 95% or more of tiny 0.3 mm particles, are the mainstay of protection against airborne pathogens. CDC recommends[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] the use of N95 by all HCWs involved in patient care during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) out of concern for airborne transmission, particularly during exposure to procedures that produce high concentrations of aerosols (like intubation, extubation, and noninvasive ventilation.)</p><p>Our compliance toward N95 mask was quite high, similar to Sagar <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] whereas unlike observation of low compliance toward the goggles in Archana Lakshmi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] study, we had high compliance toward the visor/goggles. As per a recent meta-analysis, gown may protect better against contamination than aprons. Compliance rate for surgical gown was observed to be 64.7% and 72.9% at intubation and extubation, respectively. It could be due to nonbreathable nature of the materials. The above-mentioned PPEs among anesthesia technicians also shows almost similar results which indicate equal safety measures for all HCWs involved with high-risk procedures.</p><p>PPE disposal is equally important to prevent the spread of virus. Even though it was advised to dispose of the used PPE inside the OT; we noticed 47.2% compliance to this practice, and the rest of the disposals were done, after shifting the patient, in PACU. Several logical modifications were tried to contain the virus during the pandemic. Data from SARS epidemic 2002&#x02013;2003 demonstrate that HCWs involved in intubations had six times more chances of acquiring virus. Keeping this risk in mind, almost 75% of AGPs were performed by consultants during the first wave of pandemics to minimize the aerosolization timings. To contain the aerosol-based spread of virus, many techniques were used like acrylic boxes and plastic sheets. Locally made acrylic boxes[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] were tried in only a limited number of cases in our study mainly due to inconvenience while intubating, increased time of intubation hence aerosolization, and decreased success rate in the first attempt. Furthermore, 5.5% of intubations were done under plastic sheet cover[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with video laryngoscope and 14.2% of extubations were done, with an oxygen source under cover of plastic sheet. All these barriers were added to contain the virus spread but immediately was realized that improper use can lead to fomite-borne spread. Apart from one more layer of protection the advantage of sheet was its low cost, easy availability, and disposability. It is to be discarded soon after intubation. Au Yong <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] used plastic tent or screen for intubation in pandemic time. The sheet technique is intended to protect the operator, but it fails to prevent patient and work surface contamination including the patient&#x02019;s chest and overlying gown or surgical drapes.</p><p>Though video laryngoscopes were recommended for intubation during a pandemic,[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in our study it was noticed that anesthesiologists were comfortable and faster with a conventional laryngoscope.</p><p>Limitations of our study were the presence of an observer probably could have made the participants more conscious than when not observed directly. Exposure to an additional person during AGPs but the observer had complete PPE and also study group was not high risk for infection.</p><p>In our study, we found satisfactory compliance toward usage of N95 masks alone, whereas compliance toward other available PPE and modification in anesthesia practice was found to be unsatisfactory. After our study, we insisted our team to get through with the protocols and emphasize steps to prevent further spread of COVID infection.</p><sec><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author">

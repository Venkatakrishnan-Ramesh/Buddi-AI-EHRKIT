SARS-CoV-2, of the family Coronaviridae, is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 29kb <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wu et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>. SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus in recent history to produce an epidemic, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Fouchier et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Memish et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). The virus has rapidly spread across the world causing over 570 million cases globally of COVID-19, as of July 2022, resulting in more than 6.4 million deaths (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Dong et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>) and causing economic contraction, mass unemployment, disruption of education, and increasing poverty levels (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Stawicki et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Fortunately, effective vaccines and first-generation therapies have become quickly available and are being distributed on an emergency basis. However, given the emergence of more contagious and potentially pathogenic variants, and ongoing issues of emerging resistance, the continued search for new therapeutics remains a priority (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Firestone, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Malden, 2022</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mwenda, 2021</xref>). Therapeutics discovery efforts for SARS-CoV-2 were launched by a series of repurposing screens of varying sizes. The largest were screens of a 12,000 compound library, termed ReFRAME (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Riva et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), and a screen of a 3,000 compound library (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dittmar et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Both studies identified PIKfyve inhibitors, numerous protease inhibitors, several classes of kinase inhibitors, and cyclosporin analogues. Whereas it was encouraging to see overlap between these studies, each also highlighted the interassay variability seen in the evaluation of small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication to date and the need for additional, more detailed studies.</p><p id="p0060">The current study focused on screening of the Drug Repurposing Hub (DRH) library, a collection of 6,710 compounds highly enriched with molecules that have been FDA approved, entered clinical trials (4.8%&#x000a0;phase 1, 2.0% phase 2, 7.5% phase 3, 4.4% phase 4), or have been extensively pre-clinically characterized (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Corsello et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). The library comprises clusters of structurally related molecules that are well annotated, targeting a spectrum of host proteins, as well as numerous compounds with overlapping targets, affording the opportunity to capture preliminary structure-similarity relationships of active molecules and identification of host targets of importance. The primary screen is the first to be conducted across multiple doses at this scale, providing a dataset that grades all compounds by activity and potency from strongest to least active. These data were used to expand our previous computational studies in establishing SARS-CoV-2-associated protein networks that may be enriched in host targets for future drug discovery efforts (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gysi et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). The most promising hits from the screening effort were assessed for efficacy in a series of orthogonal assays conducted in human cell lines (Huh7 and A549 cells) and human primary cell-based tissue models. Our studies confirmed the activity of several previously identified classes (inhibitors of PIKfyve, cathepsins, and protein synthesis) and additional unreported compound classes. The most promising small molecule treatment to emerge from the screen, obatoclax, demonstrated consistent activity across all cell-based assays and virus strains tested, including against MERS-CoV, and reduced SARS-CoV-2 titers by up to 10-fold in a mouse infection model using clinically achievable compound exposures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Immunofluorescence-based screening of small compound library identifies potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infecton of cells</title><p id="p0065">The DRH compound library (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A) was initially evaluated using an immunofluorescence-based assay to detect SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;infection by N protein expression. The screen was followed by computational analyses to prioritize the best candidates for follow-up in mechanistic assays evaluating the impact on cell entry, genome replication, and egress of progeny viruses, as well as evaluation in primary human cell models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). In order to capture multiple rounds of viral replication (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Ogando et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>) and obtain strong N protein staining, the primary screen was conducted for 36&#x02013;48 h. Whereas the suitability of other cell types was evaluated for screening, VeroE6 cells, derived from African green monkey kidney cells, supported the most robust and consistent infection compatible with high-throughput screening at maximum biocontainment. The assay gave an average of 80-fold difference in infection between untreated cells and cells treated with a known SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibitor, E64d <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C, upper) (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>).

Compounds were initially grouped using a log-logistic regression for viral load (Wald test; padj &#x0003c;0.01; Bonferroni correction) to classify compounds (<xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#x000a0;S1</xref>) on potency as strong (80% viral reduction, or <italic>Z</italic>-score &#x0003e;2.5), weak (50&#x02013;80% viral reduction, <italic>Z</italic>-score 1.5&#x02013;2.5), inactive (padj &#x02265; 0.01), or cytotoxic (&#x0003e;60% cell loss by nuclei count and Wald test on a log-logistic regression for cell count; padj &#x0003c;0.01; Bonferroni correction).

Morgan FPs are a topological metric used routinely for structure-similarity analysis of different small molecules (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Rogers and Hahn, 2010</xref>). To generate a Morgan FP, all substructures around the heavy atoms of a molecule within radius 3 were generated and assigned to unique identifiers. The substructure identifiers were then hashed to a binary vector of 8,192 bits (<xref rid="mmc3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#x000a0;S2</xref>), which was used to perform similarity searches. Whereas the library showed diverse structural characteristics, active molecules showed a higher median of active bits (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of the library members according to the Jaccard similarity matrix reflected the diversity of the library with no clear connections for the entire library (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>), as would be expected from a diverse library of this size, but actives showed small clusters of structurally related molecules appearing close to the diagonal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). Reducing the dimensionality of the bit vector representation to 3D space with UMAP (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">McInnes et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>) revealed the presence of local clusters <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C (and in interactive <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>) rather than global structural properties characterizing each experimental class. Of these, some have been previously reported, such as aminoquinolines (amodiaquine-related), nucleosides (Remdesivir-like), and phenothiazines (chlorpromazine-like antipsychotic drugs), but others have not been previously discussed in detail: pyrimidyl-indolines (similar to GSK2606414), azaspiranes, phenylpiperidines, benzodiazines, phenylpropanoids, and steroid lactones (cardiac glycosides).</p><p id="p0080">We next evaluated if the drugs that presented structural similarity were also targeting the same or homologous proteins. Molecules with pairwise Jaccard similarity higher than 0.5 for which both had at least one protein target described in the Broad Library were used for the analysis. Of the 32 sets of pairwise similar drugs, 29 pairs shared at least one protein target (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>). For the remaining three pairs, we compared the protein target sequences and found each was related. Only one pair (sertraline and indraline) shared structural similarity without sharing protein target similarity. This analysis suggested that the activity of structurally similar compounds corresponded to the targeting of homologous or similar protein targets.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Computational analysis reveals enriched drug targets and pathways that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication</title><p id="p0085">Of the 6,710 compounds, 4,277 had attributable host targets annotated in the DRH database. GO enrichment showed a similar profile with active drugs enriched for processes related to rRNA modulation, microtubule regulation, collagen and proteoglycan binding, GPCR receptor activity, GTP metabolism, viral transcription processes, ion channel function, and protein folding (<xref rid="mmc4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table&#x000a0;S3</xref>). It was interesting that angiotensin-related drugs were enriched, as SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, though it should be noted patients taking ACE2 inhibitors derived no clinical benefit (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gurwitz, 2020</xref>). An effort was made to prevent oversampling of promiscuous compounds and over-represented targets, but GPCR-targeting compounds are one of the most abundant drug classes and, thus, must be interpreted with caution. Fisher exact test was used to identify if active compounds were enriched for known drug targets. Of the 389 active compounds, 813 targets were identified. Of these, 51 targets were enriched over the remainder, indicating a statistical association with inhibition of virus infection (Fisher exact test; p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).

Orthogonal assays measured cell-associated viral RNA levels by a FISH assay and extracellular viral RNA by qPCR. The FISH assay was performed on fixed cells and the qPCR was performed on virus-containing cell supernatants to measure the replication and release, respectively. As the qPCR and FISH assays have low throughput, initial concentrations of the compound were limited to the EC<sub>90</sub> values from VeroE6 cell tests&#x000a0;+/&#x02212; 4-fold. For the PCR-based assay, strong and statistically significant effects of harringtonine, homoharringtonine, proscillaridin, BAY-2402234, obatoclax, and sangivamycin were seen at &#x0003c;20&#x000a0;nM, producing 74&#x02013;93% (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) decreases in viral genomic RNA (gRNA) in the culture supernatant (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>, fourth column). Whereas most of the compounds showed potencies similar to those in VeroE6 cells, the mTOR inhibitor, omipalisib, showed inhibition below the lowest concentration tested, indicating &#x0003e;10-fold stronger potency than seen in VeroE6 cells. Differences were also observed for two of the HSP90 and BET protein inhibitors that were classed as weak inhibitors in Vero cells. For the HSP90 inhibitor AT13387, virus infection was inhibited at the highest dose tested (150&#x000a0;nM). The BET inhibitors BET-BAY-002 and mivebresib were also inhibitory. Overall, such changes in activity suggest differences in dependency on BET and HSP90 proteins or drug action in Vero versus human Huh7 cells.</p><p id="p0120">The impact of compounds on viral mRNA production was measured using a FISH assay, targeting RNA production from the viral subgenomic promoter that controls the expression of structural proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B) and image analysis to score replication efficiency. In general, activity in this assay reflected that seen in the qPCR-based assay, with potency typically being within three-fold of each other (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). The dihydroorate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor, BAY-2402234, was the most potent, inhibiting infection by 50% at 10&#x000a0;nM. The protein synthesis inhibitors emetine, harringtonine, and homoharringtonine were equally active, blocking &#x0003e;50% RNA production at 50&#x000a0;nM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B). Other strongly active compounds were the nucleoside analog sangivamycin, as well as the mTOR and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors, omipalisib and obatoclax, respectively. Cardiac glycosides, proscillaridin and ouabain, were also active at 50 and 150&#x000a0;nM, respectively. Of note was the large difference in activity of harringtonine and homoharringtonine, being over five- to eight-fold more potent in the genome release assay over the vRNA production assay, which would be consistent with the disruption of the virus assembly and may reflect the need for the balanced stoichiometry of structural proteins easily disrupted by protein synthesis inhibition. Similarly, differences were noted for compounds that inhibited genome release from cells in the qPCR assay but had a negligible impact on the viral mRNA signal. These compounds were the DHFR inhibitor pralatrexate, the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor talniflumate, the BET inhibitors BET-BAY-002 and mivebresib, and the methyltransferase inhibitor BIX-01294, suggesting that each also worked to disrupt packaging of viral genomes into new virus particles and/or their release into the culture medium. A recent report indicated that methotrexate, a paralog of pralatrexate, can block the release of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA into the culture medium (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Caruso et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). For the COX inhibitor, talniflumate, COX activity has also been shown to be important for the packaging of pseudorabies genomes into capsids (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Ray et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>).

SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;S protein mediates virus entry upon binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and subsequent proteolytic activation by either cell surface expressed serine proteases, such as transmembrane protease, serine 2&#x000a0;(TMPRSS2) or endosomal cathepsins (CatL or CatS) to trigger fusion of viral and host membranes (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Eleven compounds were tested at the Vero E6 EC<sub>90</sub> concentrations in A549 cells expressing recombinant ACE2 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S7</xref>) and challenged with SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;S pseudotyped lentiviral vectors (LV).

Nanchangmycin also similarly affected both SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;S and VSV-G pseudotype LV entry (75% inhibition, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). In contrast, narasin displayed selective inhibition (&#x0223c;80%) of SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;S pseudotypes without significantly affecting VSV-G pseudotype LV entry. Salinomycin, a methylated analogue of narasin, has been shown to alter lysosome function (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Baumert et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>), which is suggestive of an effect of narasin on endosomal uptake of the virus. Similarly, proscillaridin also appeared to specifically block entry of SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;S pseudotype LV. Proscillaridin was shown to reduce receptor availability for hepatitis B virus (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Okuyama-Dobashi et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) and thus may also affect a membrane function important for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Obatoclax interestingly displayed partial inhibition of SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;S pseudotype LV entry. Despite being characterized as a BCL inhibitor, obatoclax has been reported to interfere with endosomal acidification pathways needed for the entry of alpha and flaviviruses into cells (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Varghese et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). The partial inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry by proscillaridin and obatoclax compared with the almost complete inhibition of virus replication (robust decrease in N protein expression and viral RNA copy number in cell supernatants) suggests each drug may act both at entry and post-entry steps. The methyltransferase inhibitor BIX-01294, the PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, the CREBBP/p300 inhibitor A485, the nucleoside analog sangivamycin, and the protein synthesis inhibitor emetine, were each ineffective in blocking SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry, and based on activity in the replication assays, must act at steps after virus entry into cells.<fig id="fig4"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Effect of compounds on infection by virus glycoprotein pseudotyped viruses</p><p>A549 cells expressing recombinant ACE2 protein were pretreated with each indicated compound at the EC<sub>90</sub> concentration from assays using a wild-type virus on VeroE6 cells.

Whereas COVID-19 causes severe respiratory distress, several studies have reported over half of the patients also suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. The gut is also a prominent site for virus replication (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Lamers et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Human donor-derived stratified epithelial cell models representing the airway and gut were obtained commercially (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Markus et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Similar to previous reports (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sims et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), infection in the lung model was variable between batches and not easily used for compound evaluation. However, the gastrointestinal model cells expressed ACE2 mRNA and protein (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure&#x000a0;S9</xref>) and gave robust, uniform infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A).

The compounds tested in this model, including Remdesivir as an active control (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Pruijssers et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), were used at the VeroE6 EC<sub>90</sub> concentration. Emetine, GSK2606414, and obatoclax were as effective as Remdesivir, preventing &#x0003e;80% of cell infection. Proscillaridin was less effective, showing inhibition ranging from 50 to 80%. These observed differences helped further refine compound activities, with the most promising showing consistent activity across cell lines and human tissue models.<fig id="fig5"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Inhibition of infection in primary human cell model and efficacy testing in the K18 ACE2 mouse model of disease</p><p>(A) Primary intestinal epithelial cell cultures were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 and fixed after three days in formalin.

We used K18-hACE2 transgenic mice that express recombinant human ACE2 (hACE2) protein under the control of a K18 cytokeratin promoter, to evaluate the compound as a treatment for disease. Others have shown that challenge by the intranasal route results in virus replication in the lungs, heart, brain, kidneys, and gut (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hassan et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Winkler et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), with titers increasing over 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days and then subsiding after day 5 in most tissues, but with titers in the brain continuing to rise to &#x0003e;10<sup>8</sup> pfu/g tissue. The latter is thought to result in severe symptoms, which may not be relevant to human disease outcomes. To focus on treatments effective in the respiratory system, animals were treated daily for 4&#x000a0;days after virus challenge and virus load in the lungs was measured. Vehicle control animals reached titers consistent with previously reported levels of 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup> FFU/g lung tissue. At a dose of 3&#x000a0;mg/kg, obatoclax gave a consistent and significant reduction in average virus load by &#x0003e;88% in both male and female mice (p&#x000a0;= 0.0028). For two of the female-treated mice, lung virus load fell below the limits of detection of the assay, although one did have trace amounts of detectable virus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B).

Surprisingly, the Beta variant showed several differences in susceptibility to drug treatment. Of note, omipalisib appeared to elevate infection, whereas A485 and BAY-2402234 showed little activity. In contrast, the Delta variant showed a similar profile to that seen for the Washington strain used for the initial screening. This suggests that the Beta variant may have a different dependency profile on cell processes disrupted by the compounds.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p id="p0150">Whereas multiple vaccine candidates and several targeted drugs are now available, alternative therapeutic avenues will be needed to control COVID-19.

Of the approximately 200 strongly active compounds, multiple candidates had potencies that overlapped with their clinically achievable exposures at the EC<sub>90</sub>.</p><p id="p0155">We performed a detailed mechanistic analysis for 40 inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication with differing ascribed mechanisms of action, including proscillaridin, emetine, obatoclax, sangivamycin, omipalisib, GSK2606414, and BAY2402234. Each demonstrated <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> potency that may be clinically useful given further evaluation in the context of disease. Structural analysis revealed distinct clusters of related molecules with conserved molecular motifs, suggesting potential pharmacophores that could be further developed into more highly active compounds. Further analysis of the reported mechanism of action and associated gene targets suggested discrete families of host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication related to microtubule function, mTOR, ER kinases, protein synthesis and folding, and ion channel function. Mechanistic evaluation of the antiviral effects of the lead candidates revealed activities impacting each step of virus replication from cell entry through to egress and may provide new tools to better understand the infection cycle of this virus. These results highlight the host dependency factors necessary for SARS-CoV-2 replication and potential sites of virus vulnerability for further development of antiviral therapeutics.</p><p id="p0160">Obatoclax consistently showed potent antiviral activity across all <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> systems, as well efficacy in the mouse disease model. The 10-fold decrease in lung titers is promising given that a similar reduction of virus load has been associated with decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Fajnzylber et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Obatoclax was originally developed as a broadly acting BCL-2 homology domain 3 inhibitor for cancer treatment (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">McCoy et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>) with activities including inducing apoptosis and elevating autophagy (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Camp&#x000e0;s et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">McCoy et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), each potentially virucidal outcomes. However, the 7 other BCL-2 inhibitors that we tested were weak or inactive, indicating that BCL-2 inhibition is less likely to be a specific mechanistic target. Significantly, a previous report showed obatoclax, but not other BCL-2 antagonists, appeared to inhibit endosomal acidification. This was shown to be the likely cause of inhibition of alphavirus infection through preventing pH-dependent endosomal escape (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Varghese et&#x000a0;al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 is known to require endosomal acidification for triggering of fusion of the endosomal and virus membranes to release the virus capsid and genome into the cell cytosol to initiate replication. Consistent with this mechanism, the pseudotype infection assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>) showed obatoclax partially blocking infection for the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype. Indeed, a recent report demonstrated that this is the likely mechanism of action for this drug (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Mao et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>). However, another report showed that the influenza virus, which also requires endosomal acidification to infect cells, was unaffected by obatoclax (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Park et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Our data support a dominant role for obatoclax interfering with S function and therefore endosomal escape, but also suggests an additional entry-independent mechanism that will require more detailed work to be understood.</p><p id="p0165">One of the most potent classes of inhibitors identified were the cardiac glycosides, such as proscillaridin, that have Na+/K+ channel blocking activity. These steroid-like molecules affect cardiac function (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Hauptman and Kelly, 1999</xref>), have been reported to alter cell membrane fluidity (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Manna et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), affect receptor function for a range of ligands, and can induce apoptosis (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Fang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>) of cancer cells. Based on the potent cardiac effects and narrow therapeutic windows, they are unlikely to be viable for repurposing, but may provide information on virus infection mechanisms. The pseudotype entry assay suggested that proscillaridin, like obatoclax, only partially interfered with virus entry. Cardiac glycosides were reported to inhibit hepatitis B entry into cells by interfering with binding to its receptor, the sodium/bile acid cotransporter, SLC10A1/NTCP, as well as a post-entry replication step (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Okuyama-Dobashi et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Hepatitis B virus showed a similar spectrum of cardiac glycoside type and potency infection inhibition to that seen here for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a similar mechanism may aid SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, other cardiac glycosides, including ouabain, also a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor, were found active against HIV-1 gene transcription by altering RNA processing (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Wong et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>) with disruption of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/1 (ERK1/2) signaling being responsible for infection inhibition. Another action of cardiac glycosides is to inhibit protein synthesis (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Perne et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, other known protein synthesis inhibitors, such as emetine, harringtonine, and homoharringtonine, rivalled the cardiac glycosides as potent inhibitors, in some cases showing efficacy at low nanomolar concentrations. These agents have previously been well characterized as broad-spectrum antivirals (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>) and likely reflect the importance of balanced protein production needed during virus replication and assembly.</p><p id="p0170">Another class of compounds that have not been reported to affect SARS-CoV-2 infection are the BET inhibitors. These compounds, like mivebresib, affected SARS-CoV-2 infection in both cell types tested and were identified in our protein network analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>). Previous work showed two of the four BET proteins, BRD2 and BRD4, were bound by virus E protein (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). The E protein is involved in the assembly and budding of newly formed coronaviruses from the cell. Our finding that the BET inhibitors block viral egress (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>) is consistent with this mechanism of action. Being able to identify such egress inhibitors also serves to demonstrate the utility of the secondary orthogonal assays to detect the effects of candidate compounds on the virus at different points in its life cycle.</p><p id="p0175">In addition to identifying individual compounds that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2, we have demonstrated that the data from the high-throughput screen can be used to identify the potential importance of cellular pathways required for virus replication that in turn may lead to new drug targets not part of the screen. Recent publications have demonstrated a convergence of data obtained from large-scale screens, such as genome-wide CRISPR and small molecule screens. For example, both genetic and compound screens have repeatedly suggested endosomal trafficking as an important pathway for viral entry and replication, including for coronaviruses (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Puhl et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Wei et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Wong et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). This view is bolstered by the reproducible activity of apilimod in our study and others (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>), and the positive activity observed in our screen with APY0201, a second PIKfyve inhibitor. However, we also found distinct differences between genetically closely related virus strains, suggesting that even subtle changes in the virus genome can induce complicated changes in host factor dependency and replication behavior. This finding emphasizes the need to evaluate multiple virus strains for susceptibility to small molecule inhibitors.</p><p id="p0180">The two largest compound screens reported to date are this study and the screen of the 12,000 compound ReFRAME library (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Riva et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Significant overlap was observed in the classes of molecules observed to have activity, but new active compounds were also identified. The main submicromolar potency leads identified in the ReFRAME study included apilimod, VBY-825, ONO 5334, Z LVG CHN2, and MDL 28170. Of these, apilimod and VBY-825 were present in the DRH library and gave similar activities in both studies. In the present study, we also identified additional active drug classes including the BET inhibitors. The main difference in the assay design of the two screens was the use of a single treatment dose (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) and measuring infection by virus-induced cell death for the ReFRAME screen versus multiple concentrations and virus protein expression used here, which likely accounts for the differences in outcomes. A recent report indicated that many drug repurposing efforts for antivirals may enrich compounds that induce phospholipidosis (PLD) by disrupting cell lipid metabolism (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Tummino et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Most of these compounds have micromolar potencies for inhibition of virus infection that reflect the effects on PLD. By examining only the most potent compounds from our screening, we likely avoided such compounds, as indeed none showed PLD even when tested at over 100 times that needed to inhibit virus infection.</p><p id="p0185">In summary, using a high-throughput drug screen, we have identified both potent antivirals and targeted host factors involved in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. We aimed here to provide both a more detailed understanding of how the virus hijacks host machinery to replicate, as well as methods to interrupt these dependencies. By making all the data publicly available through the DRH, we anticipate that both the active and inactive compounds will be useful for future studies on anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development. We also provide a comprehensive roadmap for a more rigorous computational analysis of future antiviral drug screens. Owing to the continued need for antivirals to combat COVID-19, our findings will aid scientists and clinicians with identifying, prioritizing, and testing therapeutics, and help alleviate the burden this pandemic has placed on our society. Whereas these findings are encouraging and suggest drug-repurposing as a productive approach for rapidly identifying treatments, it is important to be mindful that unexpected drug-disease interactions may occur when used for a different purpose, necessitating prospective clinical trial assessments.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="p0190">The work is dependent on the annotation of the drug database used. As more information is obtained on drug action and targets, the network models are expected to improve. Multiple cell types were tested in this study as it has been reported that drug activities can vary depending on the cell type. In this study, we focused on compounds that were active in multiple cell systems, thus increasing the confidence in outcomes. The mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 disease provides a good measurement of the effectiveness of a drug for preventing disease but the correlation to human disease is still being determined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>STAR&#x02605;Methods</title><sec id="sec5.1"><title>Key resources table</title><p id="p0200">

All molecular substructures up to radius 3 were assigned to unique identifiers and hashed to vectors of 8,192 bits in order to capture fragments of bigger size and reduce the potential bit collision.

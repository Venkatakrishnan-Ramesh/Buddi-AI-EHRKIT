The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, myocarditis, and even death.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p id="p0015">COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at a higher risk of morbidity and mortality. However, it remains unclear if the presence of cardiovascular conditions pose an independent risk or is mediated by other factors (eg, age). Cardiovascular disease was a common comorbidity in patients with COVID-19 predecessors SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome. In SARS, the prevalence of CVD was 8% and its presence increased the risk of death 12-fold.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Also, tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmia, or even sudden cardiac death is commonly observed in patients with SARS.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> COVID-19 contributes to cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial injury as a result of acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, stress-cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. The higher mortality in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities may be directly attributable to underlying CVD or merely coincident with CVD.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p id="p0020">The severity and extent of cardiovascular effects of COVID-19, along with the effect of specific treatments, are not yet known and are subject to scrutiny and investigation.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Myocardial injury may result from direct viral myocardial infection. Recent studies have indicated that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a functional receptor with a strong binding affinity to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and is highly expressed in human heart. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that COVID-19 induced cardiac injury might be mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> At present, we cannot rule out that long-term intake of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors and/or angiotensin-receptor blockers may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and virus replication in patients taking medication for hypertension. Conversely, it is not yet known whether the intake of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors and/or angiotensin-receptor blockers, when infected, is beneficial for pulmonary outcome.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p id="p0025">Hypertension has been reported as a 'risk factor' for COVID-19 but there has been a lack of clarity as to whether this means risk factor for acquiring the disease, the severity of disease, or for poor outcomes.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> In Qatar (2012), leading causes of disease burden among the population were ischemic heart disease (11.8%), road traffic accidents, birth asphyxia, and birth trauma.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is also rising in Qatar and is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events, which results in a higher rate of mortality.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p id="p0030">This study aims to report whether pre-existing CVD increases the risk for hospitalization and further complications in patients with COVID-19, attending primary health care settings in Qatar.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="p0035">This was a retrospective cohort study. Qatar, a high-income Arab country in the Middle East, has invested considerably in its health care system. This includes a publicly funded primary health care service delivered by Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC), the largest primary care provider in Qatar. At the time of undertaking this study, PHCC had 27 primary health care centers (all accredited by Accreditation Canada International) distributed across the country. Every resident in Qatar is eligible to register with a PHCC health center for a nominal annual fee and utilize its services. On July 1, 2016, the Cerner electronic medical record system became fully functional across all PHCC health centers in Qatar. Primary Health Care Corporation&#x02019;s laboratories are accredited by the College of American Pathologists and follow gold standard laboratory procedures for diagnosis and detection of comorbidities to ensure the highest standard of care for patients.</p><p id="p0040">Data of patients with CVD who tested positive for COVID-19 were extracted from the electronic medical records of 27 health centers across the country, from February 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020.

All patients who met the criteria, were swabbed either at the health centers or in the hospital facilities. Patients who have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, by positive result on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample, were included in the study. The study was reviewed by the PHCC Institutional Review Board and followed all regulations to ensure the protection of privacy and confidentiality of the participants. After obtaining ethical approval, data was collected from the electronic records of individual patients, which included information regarding patient demographic characteristics, comorbidities, initial laboratory tests, diagnoses during the hospital course, treatments including invasive mechanical ventilation and kidney replacement therapy, and most importantly patient outcomes.</p><p id="p0050">Study population included COVID-19 positive patients with CVD, presenting to any of the 27 health centers during the study period.

The need is to capture the real risk factors that lead to hospitalization and further complications from the study group); c) patients with underlying CVD; d) coronary artery disease; e) hypertension; f) arrythmias; g) heart failure. Patients with pre-existing pulmonary disease (eg, Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), immunocompromised patients (chronic medical conditions, taking immunosuppressants), malignancies, beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in blood to check pregnancy, and patients who are registered under Qatar red crescent clinics were excluded from the study as they belong to secondary care settings.

Among 10,178 patients, most were males with a median age of 50.83 years with symptoms. This may be due to the migration of foreign workers and predominantly male population in the region. Patients more than 70 years of age are 3.86 times more likely to have the risk of hospital admission in last 28 days compared with those in the other age groups. Older age, kidney diseases, and neurological symptoms were the major predictors of higher risk of having hospital admission and complications than the patients with other comorbidities.</p><p id="p0100">The mean age of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were diagnosed at PHCC during the study period was lower as compared with the median age of the patients with COVID-19 in a study conducted in UK (67.4 years) during the early stages of the pandemic.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> We found that the risk of cardiovascular complications is higher in male patients with predisposing conditions such as older age, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, rheumatic heart disease, kidney disease, neurologic symptoms, hematologic problems, and liver disorders. The observation was comparable to the results of a national study conducted in UK during the early stages of the pandemic.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> In that study male gender, older age, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis associated with endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, thrombosis, and microvascular obstruction were found to be the major causes of hospitalization and complications. It was also reported that COVID-19 may lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including myocardial injury in both the presence and the absence of atherosclerotic epicardial coronary disease. In the current study, only primary care data is available for us and patients with severe illness presented directly to secondary care for prognosis and further treatment.</p><p id="p0105">Hypertension is one of the major risk factors along with other comorbidities in our patient population.

The pandemic has affected every part of the world. However, infection rates and case fatality rates vary widely among countries and depend on the virus variant. During our data collection period, the case fatality rate was 3.2% in the US, 7.5% in Canada, 15% in the UK, whereas in Qatar and Kuwait it was only 0.16% and 0.67%, respectively (as of August 10, 2020).<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> It has been assumed that population demographics and comorbidity burden are the key determinants of variability in case fatality rates.

It is conceivable that right censoring with the time delay between onset of disease to death may play a part, though similarly very low mortality after the study period ended does not support this. The role played by factors, such as free access to high-quality medical care for everyone residing in Qatar, availability of a high number of critical care beds or differences in viral subtypes, needs further study.</p><p id="p0135">This study outlines the cardiovascular risks and outcome in COVID-19 positive patients with CVD attending PHCC in Qatar.

Furthermore, besides dose constraints, what factors may help reduce the risk of radionecrosis are unknown.</p><p id="para0010">It is impossible to study the effects of radionecrosis on neurologic tissues directly in healthy human brains and hence animal models of radionecrosis are necessary. It is therefore of interest to develop an animal model of brain radionecrosis in both rats and mice that allows high maximum doses with minimal toxicity to the animals. Linear accelerator (LINAC)-based SRS with multiple arcs is becoming more widespread and growing in availability, which allows efficient treatment of both small and large neurologic tumors with minimized dose spillover to surrounding normal-appearing brain tissues.<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Recently, clinical studies have used LINAC-based SRS to treat essential tremor patients.<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> These studies use single fraction, highly focused (&#x0223c;4 mm), and high dose (maximum 162 Gy) plans to irradiate the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus and induce radionecrosis.

However, LINAC SRS in clinics typically uses cone sizes &#x02265;4 mm, which is comparable to the size of the mouse brain hemisphere. It is so far unknown if the dose volumes of this clinical approach could cause similarly severe toxicity as in whole brain or whole hemisphere treatments in small animals. This could affect the development of radionecrosis and may shorten animal lifespans, both of which are not desirable. In this work, we translate such a clinically available LINAC-based SRS protocol to both rats and mice to demonstrate the feasibility of this brain radionecrosis model.</p></sec><sec id="sec0002"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="sec0003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p id="para0011">All animal-related studies were approved by local Institutional Animal Care &#x00026; Use Committee.

The iPlan system (version 4.5.5; Brainlab Company, Munich, Germany) was the treatment planning system to design all the plans for the mice. A high-resolution computed tomography (CT) (voxel size of 0.2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.2 mm<sup>3</sup>) of a same-age mouse was imported into iPlan RT dose for treatment planning. Our smallest SRS cone of 4 mm from Brainlab was selected to minimize dose to surrounding brain tissue. The isocenter was placed at one-third to the left side in the left-to-right direction, midline in the anterior-to-posterior (ie, rostral-caudal) direction, and midline in the superior to inferior (SI; ie, dorsal-ventral) direction. For this study, we used 3 different prescription levels of 140, 100, and 60 Gy with 5 mice each. The maximum dose of 140 Gy was chosen to replicate the range of SRS treatments for patients with tremors.<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> One cohort of 6 rats was treated with 140 Gy using a similar plan to test feasibility across species. To further spare the normal tissue from the radiation damage, arc therapy instead of static fields was chosen to deliver the dose. The geometry of every plan, including the couch and gantry angles, remained the same for different dose levels, and the numbers of monitor units were renormalized to deliver the prescription dose to isocenter. A total of 10 arcs with the same dose weight of each arc to isocenter were used. <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the gantry and couch angles of the plans both in the Varian convention and the matching International Electrotechnical Commission convention.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl0001"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Table and gantry angles of the treatment plans in both Varian convention and IEC convention</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0006">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"/><th valign="top">1</th><th valign="top">2</th><th valign="top">3</th><th valign="top">4</th><th valign="top">5</th><th valign="top">6</th><th valign="top">7</th><th valign="top">8</th><th valign="top">9</th><th valign="top">10</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">Couch angle (Varian convention)</td><td valign="top">260&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">245&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">230&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">215&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">200&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">160&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">145&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">130&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">115&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">100&#x000b0;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top">Couch angle (IEC convention)</td><td valign="top">280&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">295&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">310&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">325&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">340&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">20&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">35&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">50&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">65&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">80&#x000b0;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Gantry angle (Varian convention)</td><td valign="top">Start</td><td valign="top">150&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">30&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">150&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">30&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">150&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">210&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">330&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">210&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">330&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">210&#x000b0;</td></tr><tr><td/><td valign="top">End</td><td valign="top">30&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">150&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">30&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">150&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">30&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">330&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">210&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">330&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">210&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">330&#x000b0;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Gantry angle (IEC convention)</td><td valign="top">Start</td><td valign="top">30&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">150&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">30&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">150&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">30&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">330&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">210&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">330&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">210&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">330&#x000b0;</td></tr><tr><td/><td valign="top">End</td><td valign="top">150&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">30&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">150&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">30&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">150&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">210&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">330&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">210&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">330&#x000b0;</td><td valign="top">210&#x000b0;</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="spara007"><p>Abbreviations: IEC = International Electrotechnical Commission.</p></fn><fn id="spara008"><p>All the treatments were administered with a system commissioned in Varian convention.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="sec0005"><title>Radiation plan delivery</title><p id="para0013">The animals used were age-matched female CD-1 mice (Envigo, Indianapolis, Ind, USA) and male Fischer rats (F344/NHsd; Envigo; Indianapolis, Ind, USA).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to generate radionecrosis in mouse brains using a clinical LINAC. Treatment planning on CT simulation as well as registration and alignment with high-resolution onboard CBCT allowed for accurate targeting in small animal brains comparable to that in patients. Successful delivery using a wide range of doses (60-140 Gy) demonstrates the flexibility of this method to accommodate even the ultrahigh doses used in patients to date. The high incidence of radionecrosis in multiple species indicates this method can be applied to both rat and mouse tumor and/or necrosis models. The lesion volumes were tracked over time in the 100 and 140 Gy mice and showed growth over 13 weeks after treatment. The steady initial growth, high incidence, short time to onset, and low variance of lesion volume at the initial time point in the 140 Gy cohort are desirable characteristics of an animal model of radiation necrosis. The histopathologic features of the tissues at their endpoints are consistent with radionecrosis. The dose-dependence of these features highlights a potential qualitative difference in injury induced by higher dose neuro-ablation techniques versus lower dose in cancer therapies and motivates future study of this relationship.</p><p id="para0023">Preclinical models in animals to evaluate novel radiotherapies, radioprotective pharmaceuticals, and imaging methods are an essential step toward human implementation in clinical radiation oncology. Typically, radionecrosis is generated in 1 hemisphere of the animal and the contralateral hemisphere serves as a control. It is a challenging procedure due to the small size of rodent brains. To this end, specialized small animal irradiators have been developed and successfully implemented to induce radionecrosis in mice,<xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> but such a model requires dedicated preclinical equipment that is not broadly available.

However, Gamma Knife is not widely available to clinics, which limits how translatable it is to many institutions. To overcome this disadvantage, the LINAC, which is more commonly used in clinics, has been applied in rats.<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> This model uses a single beam delivery but suffers toxicity such as moist desquamation dermatitis from a 60 Gy treatment.<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> This may limit the maximum deliverable dose using a single beam, which is undesirable when studying radionecrosis induced by higher doses such as 140 Gy used in the SRS treatment of patients with tremors.<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Moreover, rats are relatively more expensive and less used than mouse models particularly in cancer research. This may limit the ability to study large cohorts to investigate several hypotheses and make strong statistical conclusions.</p><p id="para0024">Although animal models of radiation treatment have existed for decades, keeping these models relevant to the rapidly emerging technologies in human care is nontrivial. For instance, clinical SRS has been shown to have benefits over whole-brain radiation therapy in treating brain metastases,<xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> but requires accurate targeting that may be difficult to implement in mice.<xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Dedicated preclinical irradiators have grown in sophistication to meet such challenges. Small animal irradiators with onboard imaging allow for highly accurate target localization and radiation delivery.<xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> However, these machines generally do not fully replicate human therapies, for example, differing in dose rate and beam quality.<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> Furthermore, mice are sensitive to long durations of anesthesia,<xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> so the low-dose rate of small animal irradiators may endanger the animals in the case of high-dose therapies. The use of clinical machines may therefore have advantages in cases where submillimeter targeting can be sacrificed for a more exact model of radiation. For this reason, several models of radiation necrosis in small animals have used clinical machines for irradiation. Gamma Knife has successfully delivered high doses (60 Gy prescribed at the 50% isodose line) to small volumes in mice,<xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> but clinical Gamma Knife generally suffers from a lower dose rate than LINAC-based methods<xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> and may prolong an animal's time under anesthesia. Our treatment model in this study used a clinical machine to normalize effects of beam quality and treatment time on pathologic response to radiation. The high-dose rate of clinical LINAC facilitates high subject throughput and mitigates negative effects from prolonged time under anesthesia. In fact, modern LINACs that have flattening filter free mode can deliver dose at least twice as fast as the LINAC used in our study.</p><p id="para0025">Relative to other models of radiation necrosis using clinical LINAC, hypofractionated SRS enables higher doses in smaller volumes than previously published in mice. The plans used in this study were modeled after the highest doses used in patients with small treatment volumes. Our mice showed only mild observable toxicity in our maximum 140 Gy dose with multiple circular photon arcs. Such a high dose would not be achievable without severe toxicity using a single field beam. Because biopsy is not clinically accessible in many central nervous system therapies, an animal model able to accommodate these doses allows further study of the effect of high-dose radiation on tissues in vivo<italic>.</italic> Furthermore, an in vivo model accurately replicating human therapies, which can be monitored over time by imaging histology or imaging, allows for better testing of drugs and novel imaging methods.</p><p id="para0026">The results of this study preliminarily demonstrate the feasibility of generating radionecrosis in both mice and rats using LINAC-SRS. BBB breakdown as indicated by Gd-MRI was used as a biomarker for necrosis, but a histology time course could further elucidate what pathologic changes occur other than those detected by perfusion. The histologic results in this study demonstrate that fibrinoid necrosis does occur, but a larger study could enable quantitative grading of the extent of necrosis for comparisons between doses. BBB breakdown was also used as a marker to localize dose delivery and measure treatment accuracy. An alternative assessment of accuracy performed by Kim et al<xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> to characterize Cyber Knife targeting in mice was to sacrifice the subjects shortly after treatment and perform staining sensitive to DNA strand breaks.

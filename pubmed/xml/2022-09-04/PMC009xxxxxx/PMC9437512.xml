While the literature has shown that repair construct can affect the outcome of a rotator cuff repair, and the double-row repair is typically favored over the single-row repair for larger rotator cuff tears, the double-row repair also has some shortcomings. These shortcomings are related to the increased technical difficulty of the procedure, as well as increased costs due to the increased number of anchors used. Both of these factors also lead to an increase in the amount of time spent in the operating room as well. This study describes a surgical technique to help mitigate this shortcoming of the double-row repair by using a single medial-row anchor in our double-row construct for repair of a massive rotator cuff tear.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0016"><title>Technique Video</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2a"><caption><title>Video 1</title><p>The procedure is begun in the subacromial space viewing from a posterolateral portal and working through an anterolateral portal of a right shoulder. A subacromial bursectomy and decompression are performed. The rotator cuff tear is identified and freed from bursal adhesions both anteriorly and posteriorly. The footprint of the rotator cuff tendon is identified and cleaned of all soft tissue with electrocautery. A burr is used to decorticate the footprint of the rotator cuff tendon. An 18-gauge spinal needle is used to plan placement of an anterior accessory portal in order to allow placement of a tap and anchor in line with the vector of reduction of the rotator cuff tendon. A 5.5-mm SwiveLock anchor (Arthrex, Naples, FL) is preloaded with 2 FiberWire sutures and then additionally loaded with 5 FiberTape sutures through the eyelette. The anchor is advanced into bone. The FiberTape sutures are then sequentially passed through the rotator cuff tissue from posterior to anterior. The FiberWire sutures are passed through the biceps tendon, which is left intact to its origin at the superior glenoid labrum, as well as the overlying rotator cable tissue. The FiberWire sutures are then tied with a knot-pusher to perform a biceps tenodesis and further reinforce the rotator cuff repair by helping prevent superior humeral head migration. Alternating FiberTape and FiberWire sutures are then taken and placed into an anterior lateral row anchor. They are tensioned and then secured to reduce the rotator cuff tendon. The remaining sutures are then taken and anchored in the same fashion to a posterior lateral row anchor. This technique simplifies the fixation of a massive rotator cuff tear and also reinforces the repair with the biceps tendon. The senior author has seen no loss of range of motion postoperatively compared to patients having undergone biceps release and then tenodesis.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.mp4"/></supplementary-material></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0010">Massive rotator cuff tears are a common issue treated by orthopaedists.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Defined as a rotator cuff tear involving 2 or more tendons or tear size &#x0003e;3&#x000a0;cm, these tears are known to be bad actors for patients.

The procedure can be technically demanding and require increased time in the operative suite to address the tear. In addition, as the tear size grows, surgeons are more likely to use more implants to address the tear, which leads to increased costs.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> In this Technical Note, we describe a technique for repair of a massive rotator cuff tear using a transosseous equivalent, double-row construct with a single medial-row anchor, 5 free FiberTape sutures, and 2 preloaded FiberWire sutures.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Indications and Contraindications</title><p id="p0015">Patients are indicated for the following procedure who have been found to have a rotator cuff tear and have not responded to nonoperative management.

The operative extremity is prepped and draped in the normal standard fashion. Use of an arm holder is also implemented to aid arm positioning throughout the procedure.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>The standard beach-chair position for a right shoulder arthroscopic procedure used by the senior author.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Arthroscopic Procedure (With Video Illustration)</title><p id="p0025">A narrated video with demonstration of the surgical technique described in this section can be reviewed (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Video 1</xref>). Standard posterior, anterolateral, and posterolateral portals are used (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The posterior portal is established first and can be used to enter the glenohumeral joint for the diagnostic portion of the arthroscopic procedure. For some massive rotator cuff tears, entering the subacromial space primarily may be sufficient, as adequate visualization of the glenohumeral joint is possible from the subacromial space given the size of the rotator cuff tear. The anterolateral portal is established with use of a spinal needle under direct visualization. The motorized shaver is then introduced to perform a bursectomy, followed by an electrocautery device to remove bursa from the undersurface of the acromion. The motorized shaver is then again used to perform an acromioplasty to complete the subacromial decompression portion of the procedure.<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>The location of arthroscopy portals used during the procedure for a right shoulder in the beach chair position. The posterior (P), posterolateral (PL), and anterolateral (AL) are demonstrated. The location of an additional anterior portal will vary depending on the best location for trajectory to place the medial-row anchor. This portal will also be used for suture management as well.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0030">Attention is then turned to the rotator cuff tear. With use of the shaver, the tear is defined and any adhesions superiorly and inferiorly to the cuff tissue are removed. Care is taken, at this point, to note the tear characteristics and to plan for placement of the single medial-row anchor based upon what vector the tissue needs to be pulled to be reduced. Switching between lateral and posterior portals may be necessary to ensure the rotator cuff tissue has been adequately freed from bursal tissue. The footprint of the rotator cuff is then prepared with use of the shaver to expose bleeding bone.</p><p id="p0035">Under direct visualization, a spinal needle is used to establish a posterolateral portal to the subacromial space. The camera is moved to view from this portal and a cannula is placed into the anterolateral portal. Using an arthroscopic grasper or grasping suture passer device, the reduction of the rotator cuff tissue is evaluated and location for the single medial-row anchor is planned (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). If necessary, anterior marginal convergence sutures can be used to help bring the posteriorly retracted rotator cuff more anterior (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). These will also help to reinforce the passed suture tapes from the medial-row anchor. An accessory anterior portal is made with use of a spinal needle in a trajectory that will allow for placement of the medial-row anchor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). An awl is used to prepare a bone tunnel for a double loaded 5.5-mm SwiveLock anchor (Arthrex, Naples, FL) additionally loaded with 5 free FiberTape sutures. The single medial-row anchor is then placed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>).<fig id="fig3"><label>Fig 3</label><caption><p>The arthroscopic view of the subacromial space from the posterior viewing portal of a right shoulder in the beach chair position.

For massive rotator cuff tears, in which the single medial-row anchor can be placed anteriorly in the rotator cuff footprint just posterior to the biceps groove, the preloaded FiberWire sutures are used to incorporate the biceps tendon into the repair after it is freed from the biceps groove (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). The senior author has used&#x000a0;this technique to help reinforce the repair and help further restrain superior migration of the humeral head for patients with massive rotator cuff tears. The preloaded FiberWire sutures are tied arthroscopically to tension the biceps tendon to the footprint of the rotator cuff (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref>). Finally, all of the FiberTape sutures are docked in 2 lateral-row SwiveLock anchors (Arthrex). The tapes are placed into anterior or posterior lateral row anchors in alternating fashion to form a crossing tape construct and to compress the rotator cuff tissue into the rotator cuff footprint (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>).<fig id="fig7"><label>Fig 7</label><caption><p>The arthroscopic view of the subacromial space from the posterolateral viewing portal of a right shoulder in the beach chair position.

These steps have likely led to improved outcomes for these massive rotator cuff tears. The ability of securing the tendon to bone has been the focus of many studies trying to identify the best construct. The double-row, transosseous-equivalent construct has shown improved biomechanical strength over that of the single-row repair,<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> but the double-row repair has added cost of more anchors, increases operating room time, and is more technically demanding.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Recent systematic reviews and metanalysis of biomechanical literature have shown that factors positively influencing the strength of a repair are the number of sutures used in a repair, use of larger diameter sutures, and use of mattress stitches.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> We believe the aforementioned technique addresses some of the shortcomings of the double-row repair while incorporating all 3 components found in this review to positively influence the strength of the repair.</p><p id="p0055">Of course, any surgical technique has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For this technique, the pearls and pitfalls are summarized in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>. Advantages of this procedure are that fewer implants are used, thus decreasing the cost of the procedure. In addition, the time needed to repair even massive rotator cuff tears is reduced by simplifying the steps of the procedure. The senior author has reduced the time needed to repair complete tears of 2 or more rotator cuff tendons to about 30&#x000a0;minutes on average. We believe this specific technique is less technically demanding and can result in reduced operating room time compared with other standard double-row techniques. Potential disadvantages of the procedure are concerns of decreased contact pressure to the footprint or potential for malreduction of the rotator cuff tendon, given that there is only 1 medial-row anchor in the construct. While this may be a concern, proper placement of the medial-row anchor in the center of the vector that is required to reduce the rotator cuff tear to its footprint, along with proper spread of the lateral row anchors, we believe, mitigates these concerns. It should be noted that if the vector of reduction needed for the rotator cuff tendon is more posterior on the greater tuberosity, the bone is generally not as dense in this location and can result in medial anchor pull-out. Generally, this vector of reduction is not common in most massive rotator cuff tears, and placing the medial-row anchor more anteriorly on the greater tuberosity results in adequate reduction of the rotator cuff tendon and placement of the medial-row anchor in more dense bone resulting in less pull-out. In addition, there may be some concerns over postoperative stiffness with incorporating the biceps tendon into the repair, but there is increasing data of other techniques incorporating the biceps into various repairs with good results.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In the senior authors practice, postoperative stiffness has not been observed in patients who have had the biceps tendon incorporated into the repair compared to patients who have undergone the standard &#x0201c;loop and tack&#x0201d; biceps tenodesis technique where the biceps has been released from its origin.

<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2"><caption><title>Video 1</title><p>The procedure is begun in the subacromial space viewing from a posterolateral portal and working through an anterolateral portal of a right shoulder. A subacromial bursectomy and decompression are performed. The rotator cuff tear is identified and freed from bursal adhesions both anteriorly and posteriorly. The footprint of the rotator cuff tendon is identified and cleaned of all soft tissue with electrocautery. A burr is used to decorticate the footprint of the rotator cuff tendon. An 18-gauge spinal needle is used to plan placement of an anterior accessory portal in order to allow placement of a tap and anchor in line with the vector of reduction of the rotator cuff tendon. A 5.5-mm SwiveLock anchor (Arthrex, Naples, FL) is preloaded with 2 FiberWire sutures and then additionally loaded with 5 FiberTape sutures through the eyelette. The anchor is advanced into bone. The FiberTape sutures are then sequentially passed through the rotator cuff tissue from posterior to anterior. The FiberWire sutures are passed through the biceps tendon, which is left intact to its origin at the superior glenoid labrum, as well as the overlying rotator cable tissue. The FiberWire sutures are then tied with a knot-pusher to perform a biceps tenodesis and further reinforce the rotator cuff repair by helping prevent superior humeral head migration. Alternating FiberTape and FiberWire sutures are then taken and placed into an anterior lateral row anchor. They are tensioned and then secured to reduce the rotator cuff tendon. The remaining sutures are then taken and anchored in the same fashion to a posterior lateral row anchor. This technique simplifies the fixation of a massive rotator cuff tear and also reinforces the repair with the biceps tendon. The senior author has seen no loss of range of motion postoperatively compared to patients having undergone biceps release and then tenodesis.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.mp4"/></supplementary-material>

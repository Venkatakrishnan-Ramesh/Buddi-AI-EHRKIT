Additionally, multiple organ failure, such as acute cardiac, kidney, and liver injury, in addition to cardiac arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, and shock, may result from COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Besides acute respiratory syndrome, viral infection may also lead to serious neurological complications, including loss of smell and taste, confusion, encephalitis, and Guillain&#x02013;Barr&#x000e9; syndrome.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> While the prevalence of neurological symptoms remains undetermined, estimates indicate that between 30% to 50% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have neurological issues.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Adequate testing methods are essential for containing and treating the pandemic. One of the most widely used screening methods for COVID-19 is the nasal swab test. Since February 2020, more than 380 million tests have been performed in United States, with a million more administered daily.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, the safety of nasal swab tests is usually ignored, and reported complications in literature are scarce. Here, we present a case of iatrogenic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak after repeated nasal swab test for COVID-19 who required endoscopic endonasal repair.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Illustrative Case</title><p>A 41-year-old man and frequent international traveler presented himself to the hospital. He had previously undergone multiple nasal swab tests during 2020, with his latest accounts describing insertion via his left nostril by a physician. The test was described as particularly painful, but no nasal bleeding was noted afterwards. Clear rhinorrhea through the patient&#x02019;s left nostril while leaning forward (<ext-link xlink:href="https://vimeo.com/601875745" ext-link-type="uri">Video 1</ext-link>) was noted 5 days after the last nasal swab test. A subsequent beta-2-transferrin test returned positive and CSF rhinorrhea was confirmed at the local hospital. The patient had no history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, endonasal surgery, or obstructive sleep apnea, and he was not overweighted. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a T2-weighted hyperintensity signal (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and B</xref>) over the left cribriform plate extending to the left superior nasal concha. Computer tomography (CT) cisternography (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C and D</xref>) identified contrast accumulation in the left olfactory fossa and along the left nasal cavity. These findings remain consistent with CSF leakage through the left cribriform plate. The patient subsequently underwent endoscopic endonasal repair (<ext-link xlink:href="https://vimeo.com/601879076" ext-link-type="uri">Video 2</ext-link>) after his COVID-19 tests proved negative. Persistent CSF leakage was observed at the medial side of the left superior nasal concha base (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), and the leakage site was confirmed via intraoperative navigation (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). After denuding the surrounding mucosa, an autologous fascia graft harvested from the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle was used, and an onlay method was adopted to cover the fistula (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The graft was sealed with a fibrin sealant and packed with an autologous fat graft. The repair layers were supported postoperatively for 3 days with a 14 French Foley catheter placed within the left nostril. The patient also underwent continuous lumbar drainage for 5 days postoperatively. The CSF rhinorrhea ceased after the repair surgery, and there was no recurrence noted at the 12-week postoperative follow-up.

If left untreated, this can lead to serious central nervous system infection. CSF leak may result from traumatic, nontraumatic, and iatrogenic causes, while female gender, obesity, intracranial hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea are risk factors for spontaneous CSF leakages.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Thin-cut CT scans are used for detecting bony defects, while MRIs may help in the screening of encephalocele, hydrocephalus, or other pathologies. CT cisternography is used if no definite defect can be found based on CT alone. In our case, endoscopic repair was performed. Due to only a small bony defect without encephalocele, we opted to preserve the superior and middle nasal concha and utilized an autologous fascia and fat graft to cover the defect with an onlay and multilayer method.</p><p>Nasal swab tests that sample upper respiratory secretion via the nasopharynx is one of the main methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for screening COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Although adverse events related to nasal swab tests are usually rare and minor,<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> three cases of iatrogenic CSF leak after nasal swab tests were reported, and two of them required surgical repair (<xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref></sup> Sullivan et al. reported the first case of iatrogenic CSF leak after a nasal swab test for COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The patient had a history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and a previous surgery involving the removal of nasal polyp with a skull base bony defect at the anterior fossa and a large encephalocele. The authors theorize that the swab violated the patient&#x02019;s preexisting encephalocele and caused the subsequent CSF leak. Alberola-Amores et al. reported another case of CSF leak 1 week after the nasal swab test, which later developed into meningitis.<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The fistula was found at the left cribriform plate, and he received medical treatments only. The CSF leak resolved spontaneously, and the authors inferred that the inflammation of the meninges formed granulation tissue that may have closed the fistula. Paquin et al. reported the third case without previous surgery or trauma history.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The CT scan showed a bony defect in the posterior right cribriform plate, and the MRI showed an encephalocele projecting from the olfactory fossa of the right superior nasal cavity. The patient then underwent endonasal repair surgery and recovered well.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="t1"><label>TABLE 1.</label><caption><p>Comparison of iatrogenic CSF leak cases after nasal swab test for COVID-19</p></caption><!--OASIS TABLE HERE--><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center">Authors &#x00026; Year</th><th align="center">Age (yrs), Sex</th><th align="center">Risk Factor</th><th align="center">Location</th><th align="center">Bone Defect</th><th align="center">Encephalocele</th><th align="center">Meningitis</th><th align="center">Surgery</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Present case<hr/></td><td align="center">41, M<hr/></td><td align="center">None<hr/></td><td align="center">Left cribriform plate<hr/></td><td align="center">&#x02212;<hr/></td><td align="center">&#x02212;<hr/></td><td align="center">&#x02212;<hr/></td><td align="center">+<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sullivan et al., 2020<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup><hr/></td><td align="center">40s, F<hr/></td><td align="center">Previous nasal surgery, intracranial hypertension<hr/></td><td align="center">Right fovea ethmoidalis<hr/></td><td align="center">+<hr/></td><td align="center">+<hr/></td><td align="center">&#x02212;<hr/></td><td align="center">+<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Alberola-Amores et al., 2021<sup><xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup><hr/></td><td align="center">41, F<hr/></td><td align="center">Not mentioned<hr/></td><td align="center">Left cribriform plate<hr/></td><td align="center">Not mentioned<hr/></td><td align="center">&#x02212;<hr/></td><td align="center">+<hr/></td><td align="center">&#x02212;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Paquin et al., 2021<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></td><td align="center">38, F</td><td align="center">Not mentioned</td><td align="center">Right cribriform plate</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">+</td><td align="center">&#x02212;</td><td align="center">+</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>&#x0201c;+&#x0201d; means that the above condition was found in the case. &#x0201c;&#x02212;&#x0201d; means that the above condition was not found in the case.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Including our case, the leakage sites of all four cases were found over the anterior skull base near the midline. In our opinion, iatrogenic CSF leakages after a nasal swab test may result from unfamiliarity with the anatomy of nasal cavity. For obtaining a nasopharynx specimen, the healthcare provider should insert the swab into the nostril, parallel to the palate, close to the floor of nasal canal.<sup><xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In a nationwide Canadian study, Hiebert et al. found some heterogeneity in guidance for healthcare providers regarding nasopharyngeal swab performance.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Trauma to the skull base can be caused by inserting the swab diagonally upwards along the shape of nose and external naris (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). A nasal swab test should be performed with caution, especially in patients with potential COVID-19 infection, in whom neurological syndromes are common and often quite severe. It is intuitive that an iatrogenic CSF leak may induce direct invasion of viral infection to the central nerve system.<sup><xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> As a result, subsequent treatment for CSF leakages can be complicated in a confirmed case of COVID-19.</p><fig position="float" id="f3"><label>FIG. 3.</label><caption><p>Illustration showing the different trajectories while performing nasal swab tests.

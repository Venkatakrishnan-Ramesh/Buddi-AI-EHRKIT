Clinically, severe vasospastic angina causing total coronary occlusion can induce a wide range of myocardial infarctions and is life-threatening.<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It was reported that the prevalence rate of VSA ranged from 33.4% to 57.6% in western countries and 40% to 79% in Asian countries. Importantly, patients with VSA have relatively poor clinical outcomes, even if current therapies with calcium channel blockers and nitrates can effectively relax spastic coronary arteries and improve angina symptoms in these patients.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>The exact etiology of VSA remains unknown, and spastic coronary artery segments have no stenosis in most patients. Therefore, VSA may differ from atherosclerotic lesions. Furthermore, statins have been used worldwide to reduce adverse events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and antiplatelet therapy using aspirin or aspirin plus clopidogrel is used for the primary and secondary prevention of CAD. However, the application of these treatments has not reduced adverse events as expected in patients with VSA.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> These studies suggest that hypercholesterolemia and platelet activation are not pathogenic factors of VSA.</p><p>An early study found that platelet-activating factor (PAF) can induce coronary spasm, inflammatory cell-derived interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a potent inducer of PAF,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and mast- -and eosinophil-released histamine (HA) induces coronary artery contraction, which suggests that inflammation and inflammatory cytokines may be an important cause of VSA. One example is that allergic reactions (usually severe reactions) can cause VSA by releasing HA and other inflammatory mediators (Kounis syndrome).<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>It is well known that inflammatory processes are involved in various vascular diseases. Previous observations have shown that coronary inflammatory changes may be more important in the pathogenesis of CAS than coronary atherosclerotic changes.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Shimokawa et al found that chronic treatment with IL-1&#x003b2;, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, induced intimal thickening and CAS in vivo in animal experiments.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> An interesting study in 15 patients with VSA found that coronary adventitial and perivascular adipose tissue inflammation are associated with CAS using 18-fluorine fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This primary exploration suggests that VSA is associated with inflammation. However, more evidence is needed to establish the direct association between inflammation, especially in the heart, and VSA.</p><p>In the present observational study, we investigated whether the increased plasma inflammatory cytokines levels are associated with recurrent CAS using multivariate logistic regression to establish a predictive model to evaluate whether the levels of cytokines serve as important biomarkers to identify VSA. We further evaluated whether myocarditis and coronary adventitial and perivascular adipose tissue inflammation exist in the hearts of patients with VSA.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Study Participants and Blood Sample Collection</title><p>Patients who visited the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) donated blood samples for this study.

Between March 2012 and January 2021, 137 patients were clinically diagnosed with VSA at Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). Electrocardiography (ECG), Holter ECG, and coronary angiography were performed. Six patients with suspected VSA who did not meet the criteria were excluded according to the latest diagnostic criteria for VSA. We excluded 22 patients with VSA because blood samples were not obtained from these patients during hospitalization. The exclusion criteria included non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, stable angina, and unstable angina. Finally, 109 patients with VSA who met the diagnostic criteria, from whom blood samples were obtained, were successfully recruited for the study.

We also tried to treat these four patients with VSA using glucocorticoids, and long-term remission was achieved during the follow-up period of 3 and 6 months. Below are the reports of two typical cases.</p><p>Patient 1:</p><p>A 51-year-old man had a history of recurrent allergic asthma. The patient was admitted for recurrent chest pain for 7 years, accompanied by chest pain-related syncope five times in 3 months. The chest pain was not related to effort but to asthma occurrence, aggravation, or sleep, and lasted for 5&#x02013;30 min. Three months ago, he experienced chest pain again after getting a cold, and when it was severe, he lost consciousness for approximately 2 min. He previously underwent ECG and Holter ECG showing recurrent ST-segment elevation in leads II and III, as well as augmented vector foot and chest leads and intermittent cardioplegia for up to 9 s. On admission, ECG demonstrated ST-segment elevation and Q-wave myocardial infarction and grade III atrioventricular block (<underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=378152.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link></underline>). Coronary angiography revealed severe local stenosis of the right coronary artery, which resolved after nitroglycerine injection (<underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=378152.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link></underline>). Additionally, the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery narrowed down by approximately 20%, and the right coronary artery narrowed down by approximately 30% locally. Serum cardiac troponin was significantly elevated (3000.0 pg/mL, reference &#x0003c;34 pg/mL), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was mildly elevated (300 pg/mL). It was interesting that the blood test revealed elevated white blood cell and eosinophil levels of 15.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L and 0.84 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L while he was symptomatic. Plasma cytokine assays showed that concentrations of IL-8, TNF-&#x003b1;, and soluble suppression of tumorigenesis-2 (sST2) were significantly elevated (0.15 ng/mL, 0.03 ng/mL, and 80 ng/mL, respectively). <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT revealed a diffuse FDG uptake increase in the coronary artery and the left ventricle (<underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=378152.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure 4</ext-link></underline>). Based on clinical symptoms and angiography and ECG results, the patient was diagnosed with VSA caused by the inflammatory response of the coronary artery. He subsequently underwent immunomodulatory treatments with intravenous injection of methylprednisolone (80 mg/day) and immunoglobulin (10 g/day), as well as oral sustained-release isosorbitol dinitrate and diltiazem (90 mg/day). After treatment for 1 week, he noted significant improvement in his symptoms, and IL-8, TNF-&#x003b1;, and sST2 levels returned to normal. During the 6-month follow-up period, there was no onset of chest pain.</p><p>Patient 2:</p><p>A 64-year-old woman was hospitalized for appendicitis and experienced sudden chest pain 2 days after admission. The ECG revealed inferior T-wave inversion and ST-segment flat, but T wave disappear in all leads when she has mild chest pain, which is different from normal condition (no chest pain) during Holter ECG monitoring (<underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=378152.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure 5</ext-link></underline>). Her troponin I level was 11.02 ng/mL. Moreover, her blood tests revealed an increased neutrophil ratio and elevated hs-CRP (76.3% and 7.8 mg/L, respectively). On day 4 of hospitalization, she had ventricular fibrillation during coronary angiography of the right coronary artery which showed diffuse spasm (narrowed &#x0003e;85%), and the left coronary artery also showed mild diffuse spasm. After defibrillation and vasodilator therapy (intracoronary nitroglycerine injection, 100 &#x000b5;g), the coronary spasm improved. Spontaneous circulation returned (<underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=378152.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure 6</ext-link></underline>). On day 5 of hospitalization, the blood test revealed an elevated neutrophil count (89.7%), and the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT revealed that FDG uptake in the right coronary artery was elevated and diffusely increased in the left ventricle (<underline><ext-link xlink:href="https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=378152.docx" ext-link-type="uri">Supplementary Figure 7</ext-link></underline>). Therefore, we believe that pericoronary inflammation causes coronary spasms. She was treated with an intravenous injection of methylprednisolone (40 mg/day) and immunoglobulin (5 g/day) to inhibit the inflammatory response. Eventually, her plasma inflammatory cytokine levels returned to normal, and she was asymptomatic. After 2 months of follow-up, the patient had no chest pain.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first to investigate the relationship between the levels of multiple plasma inflammatory cytokines and VSA in a Chinese cohort and included patients with ST and normal participants as controls. We found that (1) of the tested 24 inflammatory factors, eight were significantly elevated in patients with VSA than in patients with ST and normal controls (p&#x0003c;0.001). IL-4, IFN-&#x003b1;, IL1-&#x003b1;, IL-2, and MCP-1 were lower in patients with ST than in patients with VSA. Plasma levels of IL-8, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-1ra were significantly elevated in patients with VSA and ST compared with the controls, which suggests that VSA is an inflammation-related disease and it is different from acute myocardial infarction (AMI); (2) substances that caused VSA, namely HA and ET-1<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> were also elevated; (3) further, we observed that patients with VSA had pericoronary inflammation as well as myocarditis, as shown by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT. Our findings reveal that VSA is associated with inflammation, particularly myocarditis. In addition, we found that a panel of inflammatory cytokines might help diagnose VSA.</p><p>Previous case reports<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref>have indicated that CAS is associated with inflammation and myocarditis, as confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy. <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake can effectively reflect tissue metabolism; therefore, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT can assess tissues, including the cardiac inflammatory status, by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake.<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A small cohort study using <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT found that coronary perivascular FDG uptake significantly increased in the VSA group but not in controls, suggesting coronary adventitial and perivascular adipose tissue inflammation in patients with VSA.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The present study demonstrates that the plasma levels of multiple inflammatory cytokines in patients with VSA are markedly elevated, which is different from AMI. These findings reveal that VSA is an inflammatory-associated disease.</p><p>The mechanisms of coronary spasms are important to understand this special recurrent angina pectoris. Clinically, coronary spasms can be induced by ACh or ergoline. Nihei et al found that Rho-kinase activity in circulating leukocytes in patients with VSA increased, and during the 3-year follow-up period, cardiac events occurred in 10 patients (5.7%) with VSA but in none of the patients without VSA, while VSA patients with higher Rho-kinase activity had a significantly worse prognosis than other comparable patients.<xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Increased Rho-kinase activity represents an inflammatory condition and can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathways, as well as the 20-kDa regulatory myosin light chain, thus inducing vessel contraction.<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Increased cytokine levels from neutrophils and macrophages, such as IL-6, can enhance coronary contractions by activating Rho-associated kinase.<xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In addition, IL-1 induces the synthesis of inflammatory mediators, prostacyclin, and platelet-activating factor, which directly induce CAS.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Hypersensitivity has been recognized to be related to VSA, which is referred to as Kounis syndrome.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> HA, a key factor in inflammation, especially mast cells, is an important mediator of inflammation and vasospasm. Therefore, Kounis syndrome represents a subset of patients with VSA due to inflammation. Shimokawa et al found that the local coronary segment exposed to inflammatory stimuli (IL-1&#x003b2;) was linked to vascular smooth muscle cell hyperreactivity in a porcine model with significantly elevated levels of serotonin, HA, and prostaglandin F2.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Our observation found that plasma HA and ET-1 levels in patients with VSA increased, as proven by Figeuras et al.<xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Two of our VSA patients with refractory angina pectoris achieved long-term remission after receiving treatment with glucocorticoids and immunoglobulin. The detection of inflammation may provide a new approach for diagnosing recurrent coronary spasms. Furthermore, our case report not only contributes to the diagnosis of CAS but also paves the way for alternative therapy in patients with VSA. This is also our first attempt to use glucocorticoids combined with immunoglobulin to treat patients with coronary spasms caused by inflammation. Although we have only observed a small number of clinical cases, the therapy has proven to be effective in practice.</p><p>In summary, the levels of multiple inflammatory cytokines in patients with VSA were generally increased, different from that in patients with AMI. Therefore, we were able to set a multiple inflammatory cytokine biomarker to help differentiate VSA from AMI or regular angina and provide some insight into mechanical therapy. A previous study reported that plasma levels of hs-CRP are higher in patients with coronary spasms than in those without, and elevated CRP is independently and significantly associated with coronary spasm.<xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> To further explore the relationship between inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory markers, our multivariate logistic regression showed that the predictive power of these cytokines was significantly better than that of hs-CRP and commonly inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-&#x003b1;.</p><p>The next question concerns the origin of the inflammatory cytokines. Combining the literature and this study, we suggest that VSA is a complication of myocarditis in most patients. Thus, for patients in the acute phase of VSA or recurrent attacks of VSA, anti-inflammatory therapy such as using glucocorticoids is reasonable.</p><p>A limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size. In addition, for most patients in this cohort, we only provided plasma levels of multiple inflammatory cytokines and baseline data; however, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT and positive responses to glucocorticoid therapy were available for only a few patients. Finally, regarding the predictive efficacy of inflammatory factors, we still lack a validation population for further confirmation. Therefore, further studies, including therapeutic clinical trials and multivariate cytokine panel validation, are required.</p><p>The present study demonstrates that various inflammatory cytokines in the plasma are increased and that elevated inflammatory cytokines may be useful for diagnosis and serve as a guide for anti-inflammatory treatment in patients with VSA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge the participants and support for this study.

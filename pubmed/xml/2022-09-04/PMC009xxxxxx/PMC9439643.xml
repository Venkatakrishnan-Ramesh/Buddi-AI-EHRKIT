It is unclear if this change in research is reflected in practice. At our single institution, there was evidence of a shift in alpha-blocker prescribing practices, likely reflecting responsiveness to latest published high-quality literature in the field of renal colic. A difference in prescribing trends was not observed between proximal and distal stones. At our institution, prazosin prescriptions decreased relative to tamsulosin prescriptions, in later years of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0002"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute renal colic is a common emergency department (ED) presentation and may result in a trial of conservative management or plan for intervention. Stone disease is responsible for a significant impact on quality of life and presents a significant economic burden to health-care systems.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Although several patient and stone factors influence the decision between management strategies,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> the choice and success of management plans is influenced by the use of adjunctive therapies such as alpha-blockers.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The efficacy for alpha-blockers in ureteral stones has been extensively reported on and debated in recent years. Alpha-blockers are currently widely used, and was once previously recommended across all ureteric stones regardless of size or location.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Subsequent recent evidence has put these recommendations into question.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> In particular, interest in publishing large-scale randomised-controlled trials (RCTs) has led to generating momentum for practitioners across the world to change prescribing for alpha-blockers in conservative management.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Various high-quality studies report conflicting results, making interpretation difficult when it comes to real-life practice.</p><p>For instance, a RCT by Pickard et al suggested alpha-blockers demonstrated no benefit for both passage of stone or pain control. This lack of efficacy was shown regardless of stone location or stone size.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A subsequent RCT by Furyk et al contrarily reported increase in stone passage for larger stones using tamsulosin compared to placebo.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Systematic reviews have supported that a benefit may persist in certain stone subgroups.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> These conflicting conclusions from high-quality data make it difficult for clinicians to decide on appropriate practice for managing patients with ureteral stones.</p><p>It is currently unknown the extent of how real-life clinical practice is related to up-to-date literature and whether it reflects the evidence &#x02013; and of note, the conflicting data varying between studies. Given the recent literature, this study sought to characterise trends in alpha-blocker prescriptions for patients presenting with ureteral stones in ED, and relate this to published literature.</p></sec><sec id="s0003"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective audit conducted from 01/01/2014 to 01/01/2019, of ED presentations of acute renal colic, at a single institution. Data extraction involved all consecutive patient episodes with a coded diagnosis in ED for &#x0201c;acute renal colic&#x0201d; within the study time interval, producing 4320 events (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).<fig position="float" id="f0001" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study participant selection flowchart.

Patients with multiple presentations were included, and each separate episode was analysed as a different entry. Radiographic imaging consisted of either: low-dose computerised tomography (CT), ultrasound, or X-ray. Imaging was required to be performed within 30 days of presentation. Conservative management was defined as a trial of spontaneous passage of the stone, with encouragement of increased fluid intake and offered prescription for analgesia with or without concurrent alpha-blockers. Patients were required to not be planned for subsequent surgical intervention at time of emergency department encounter, such as for stenting, nephrostomy, or ureteropyeloscopy. All patients undergoing trials of spontaneous passage were followed up in an outpatient setting with repeat imaging after 3 to 4 weeks. Regarding patient selection, study subjects elected for conservative management voluntarily after clinicians explained the various management options for obstructing ureteric calculi. Exclusion criteria included: misdiagnosis, insufficient data, or those who elected to undergo surgical intervention at the time of emergency presentation. A final count of 2163 presentations were included for this study.</p><p>Data were collected through extraction from the institutional electronic medical records system, on patient demographics, stone characteristics, and alpha-blocker prescriptions. Stone size was recorded as the maximal stone diameter reported by the radiologist, and this was then coded as a dichotomous variable of &#x02264;5 mm or &#x0003e;5 mm, for reporting consistency alongside previous literature.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Stone location was recorded and classified as either: &#x0201c;distal&#x0201d; (below level of sacro-iliac joint), or &#x0201c;proximal&#x0201d; (above sacro-iliac joint). Alpha-blockers prescribed by ED clinicians were recorded including the type of alpha-blocker &#x02013; given the availability of medications in Australia, only tamsulosin or prazosin were prescribed.</p><p>This study was approved by the local human research ethics committee.</p><sec id="s0003-s2001"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Results were categorised primarily according to stones &#x02264;5 mm or &#x0003e;5 mm. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum statistics compared groups, for age, sex, proportions of proximal versus distal stones, proportion receiving alpha-blockers, and use of imaging. Patients with missing field data were excluded from subsequent analyses.</p><p>The proportion of alpha-blocker prescriptions on discharge was analysed as a monthly time-series variable. Time-series variables were stratified by stone size &#x02264;5 mm or &#x0003e;5 mm, and by proximal or distal stone location. A moving average smoothing function was applied (lag:current:lead = 1:1:1) to improve graph visualisation and reduce month-to-month variability.</p><p>It was expected that there would be a sharp decline in alpha-blocker prescriptions from May 2015, after evidence published at this time suggested lack of efficacy.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Interrupted time-series analyses (ITSAs) were therefore conducted to assess for changes in level and trend before and after this time point, to highlight the potential effect towards clinical practice. Segmented ordinary least-squares regression models were used, with Newey-West standard errors calculated to adjust for autocorrelation. Comparison was not made between the different subgroups due to the anticipated difference in baseline levels and trends prior to May 2015.</p><p>Throughout this study, statistical significance was defined as p-value of &#x0003c;0.05.

A significant drop of 36.5% was observed in May 2015 (p &#x0003c; 0.001).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, alpha-blocker prescriptions for conservatively managed ureteric stones were characterised. This was a hypothesis-generating investigation to understand trends and how published literature may influence them, using May 2015 as an analysis time point. This study demonstrated a significant drop in alpha-blocker prescription for stones of all subgroup categories, including by stone size and by stone location.</p><p>The primary finding of this study was the sharp decrease in alpha-blocker prescription from May 2015. At this particular time point, the landmark RCT published in The Lancet by Pickard et al reported on the lack of effect of tamsulosin for improving stone clearance at four weeks.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Despite sub-analysis by stone location or size, the authors reported no sub-group demonstrated improvements in any outcome with tamsulosin. Although other explanations may contribute to our findings observed in May 2015, it is likely that observant clinicians at our institution were able to implement changes to clinical practice and quickly adapt.</p><p>Despite the sudden drop in May 2015, there was a gradual rise in alpha-blocker usage again for stones &#x0003e;5 mm from May 2015 onwards, observed in our institution. This may be reflective of other studies that contributed to the subsequent increasing trend. A RCT in 2016 examined efficacy in larger stones.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Furyk et al reported patients with stones of 5&#x02013;10 mm experienced a higher likelihood of stone passage at 28 days with tamsulosin compared to placebo (83% vs 61%, p = 0.03). The further increase in alpha-blocker usage in early 2018 may also be contributed to by a study by Ye et al. The authors reported on the significantly higher expulsion rate with tamsulosin for stones &#x0003e;5 mm (odds ratio: 2.05, p &#x0003c; 0.001).<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Efficacy of tamsulosin for stones &#x0003e;5 mm was also demonstrated by the shorter time to expulsion, lower requirement for analgesics, and significant relief of renal colic. These studies may have continued the interest to clinicians for the growing support for tamsulosin therapy.</p><p>This study primarily served as a hypothesis-generating piece to suggest how literature influences practice, and various limitations exist. The ITSA employed in this study was limited to the study of only one intervention time point, when in reality, alpha-blocker prescription trends vary by a multiple number of potential factors. Furthermore, there may be additional influence by the implementation of local guidelines that may affect prescribing practices, and this is not examined here. The total number of physicians involved across all patient episodes was not examined due to limitations of the medical records, but this would be important to assess for trends over time as a potential confounder. The inclusion of patients with multiple presentations was for increasing the sensitivity and capture alpha-blockers prescribed at any presentations, whilst acknowledging that this may &#x0201c;dilute&#x0201d; our findings. The variability in diagnostic imaging modalities also influence the accuracy of stone characteristics recorded, where CT is generally considered the gold standard.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, patients in this audit were predominantly diagnosed through the use of CT scans (93.8%), and exclusion of non-CT patients was not done to reduce selection bias. Selection bias does however remain due to the retrospective single-centre study design, and not all variables were captured, such as baseline comorbidities,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> preadmission alpha-blocker usage or variations in clinician training. This single-centre study may also have limited generalisability to other health-care services, where clinician education and practice may vary. Nevertheless, this analysis suggests prescribing practices are associated and potentially responsive to updates in literature in the conservative management of patients with ureteral stones.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, the effect of published literature on practice has been examined. In May 2015, a sharp drop in alpha-blocker prescriptions was observed. However subsequently, a steady increase in prescriptions for stones &#x0003e;5 mm followed. Future studies should investigate the difference in trends between stone size and location subgroups.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s0007"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ED, emergency department; ITSA, Interrupted time-series analysis; RCT, randomised-controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="s0008"><title>Declarations</title><p>This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Austin Health Human Research Ethics Committee (Audit/19/Austin/85).</p></sec><sec id="s0009"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to data analysis, drafting or revising the article, have agreed on the journal to which the article will be submitted, gave final approval of the version to be published, and agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0010"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest relevant to this manuscript.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Maskal</surname>

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis of convalescent plasma use in COVID-19 to identify its safety and efficacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>We comprehensively searched the databases - PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for journal papers published between December 2019 and January 2021 about the use of CPT in SARS-CoV-2, and performed a meta-analysis using random effects models and assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 1529 records, 11 studies were eligible (five RCTs, two nonrandomized intervention trials, three prospective observational, and one retrospective), and all were conducted in confirmed patients of SARS-CoV-2. Out of the 11 studies, four investigated the effect of CPT on mortality, three on symptom alleviation, five on duration of hospital stay, four on time to discharge, three on the effect on viral clearance, three on the improvement in antibody titers, two on oxygen requirement, and two on adverse events. The pooled estimate for relative risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 was no different after CPT than control (RR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.69, 1.10), (p = 0.426) but the relative risk of clinical improvement of symptoms was better after CPT (RR: 1.61, 95% CI: 0.97. 2.70). There was earlier hospital discharge after CPT over control (RR: 1.49, 95% CI: 0.79, 2.80), improved viral clearance (RR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.53), and quicker detection of antibody titer (RR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.53). No difference was observed for adverse effects between CPT and control (RR: 0.92.; 95% CI: 0.63 1.35).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>CPT appears to be a safe and promising treatment in moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 leading to faster clinical improvement, reduced oxygen requirement, early hospital discharge, and quicker emergence of protective antibodies despite having no mortality benefit.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>convalescent plasma</kwd><kwd>meta-analyses</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has inflicted a heavy casualty worldwide and the end doesn&#x02019;t seem anywhere near. Till date nearly 123 million patients are affected and 2.7 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Many old and new drugs have been tried so far with variable success, although any definitive cure is still elusive.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) involves collection of antibody-rich blood from SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients and its transfusion to affected patients. The neutralizing antibodies present in the blood bind to the viruses and prevent their entry into the host cell. They stimulate immune phagocytosis by the host cells leading to the killing of viruses. This therapy has been used earlier during Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and thereafter during the outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and Ebola viruses. Three systematic reviews consisting of 13 studies (both observational and clinical trials) have so far reported its benefit in SARS-CoV-2, whereas two meta-analyses have found no advantages.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Although FDA has approved its use for SARS-CoV-2, the specific treatment criteria are unknown. Most studies included in the earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses possessed more weaknesses than strengths. The main weakness of the studies were in the lack of uniformity in CPT, inclusion of more patients with severe disease, wide variability in the dosing and timing of CPT, dearth of information about the viral load prior to CPT, and limited data about the neutralizing antibody titers following CPT.</p><p>This systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to emendate the previous deficiencies and investigate the effects of CPT in SARS-CoV-2, and also unearth the key determinants of this treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><sec><title>Search strategy</title><p>This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review was registered in PROSPERO database (CDR 42021274135). The following databases - PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were comprehensively searched for journal papers published between December 2019 and January 2021, using the keywords &#x0201c;convalescent plasma,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;SARS-CoV-2,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;COVID-19,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;plasma,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;serum,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;immune,&#x0201d; and the related words for publications. Articles published in English language only were searched for analysis. Additionally, the references for selected studies were searched to identify other studies. Following the removal of duplicate entries, a three-stage screening process was adopted to identify eligible studies through the detailed examination of each title, abstract, and full text. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved citations and then assessed the full-text manuscripts that were considered potentially eligible. In case of disagreement between the two reviews with respect to fulfilment of inclusion criteria, the third reviewer acted as arbitrator.</p></sec><sec><title>Study selection</title><p>All studies fulfilled the following criteria: i) the population of interest was patients with confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 for any age or sex, ii) randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized single-arm intervention studies, prospective observational studies, retrospective studies were eligible, iii) the intervention measure was CPT therapy, iv) there was reporting of at least two outcomes of interest (mortality, symptom alleviation, hospital length of stay, antibody levels, viral load, effect on oxygen requirement, and v) reporting of adverse events. Only studies in English language were chosen.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: i) reviews, case series, case reports, clinical guidelines, and expert consensus, ii) animal or <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies, (iii) studies for which the full text was not available, and iv) studies with insufficient data on clinical information.</p></sec><sec><title>Data extraction</title><p>The studies retrieved during the searches were screened against the eligibility criteria and those meeting the criteria were included. Data was extracted from the eligible studies using a template by two independent authors and validated by a third. The following information was extracted: authors and country of the study, study design, number of participants, patients condition, time of administration, titers and dosages of CP, concomitant therapy, conclusion of authors, adverse events (AEs), and other results.</p></sec><sec><title>Risk of bias assessment</title><p>Two researchers independently assessed the potential bias for each selected study. The third researcher was consulted for resolving any difference of opinion. The &#x02018;Risk of Bias&#x02019; 2.0 tool was used to assess the randomized clinical trials, which includes five domains: &#x02018;randomization process,&#x02019; &#x02018;deviations from intended interventions,&#x02019; &#x02018;missing outcome data,&#x02019; &#x02018;measurement of the outcome,&#x02019; and &#x02018;selection of the reported results.&#x02019; The &#x02018;Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized studies (ROBINS-I)&#x02019; was applied to assess the risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions. It comprized seven domains: &#x02018;bias due to confounding,&#x02019; &#x02018;selection of participants,&#x02019; &#x02018;classification of intervention,&#x02019; &#x02018;deviations from intended interventions,&#x02019; &#x02018;missing data,&#x02019; &#x02018;measurement of outcomes&#x02019; and &#x02018;selection of the reported results.&#x02019; The NIH quality assessment toll was used to assess the risk of bias in observational studies. Each domain was judged as &#x02018;low,&#x02019; &#x02018;moderate,&#x02019; &#x02018;serious,&#x02019; and &#x02018;critical.&#x02019; For every criterion, risk of bias was classified as &#x02018;high,&#x02019; &#x02018;unclear,&#x02019; or &#x02018;low.&#x02019;</p></sec><sec><title>Quality of the evidence</title><p>Two researchers independently assessed the quality of evidence by using the &#x02018;Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)&#x02019; tool. The GRADE was used to create a &#x02019;Summary of findings&#x02019; table. The quality of evidence of each outcome is classified as &#x02018;high,&#x02019; &#x02018;moderate,&#x02019; &#x02018;low,&#x02019; or &#x02018;very low.&#x02019;</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical software of SPSS was used for analyses. One researcher entered the data, and two researchers checked their accuracy. For dichotomous outcomes, the number of events and total number of participants in two groups were recorded. Fixed-effects model was used if the result of the Q test was not significant (p &#x0003e; 0.1). The odds ratio (OR) and the RR with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed for all studies. A Chi-square test with a significance level at <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05 was used to assess heterogeneity of treatment effects between trials. The I2 statistic was used to quantify possible heterogeneity (I2 statistic: 30&#x02013;60% represented moderate heterogeneity, 75&#x02013;100% considerable heterogeneity). If heterogeneity was above 80%, the potential causes were explored through sensitivity and subgroup analyses. If no reason for heterogeneity could be found, meta-analysis was not conducted. Subgroup analyses were performed if appropriate based on the data retrieved.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p>Using the predefined key words, the initial literature search revealed 1529 studies from various databases. After pruning the results as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 11 studies were selected for analysis as is shown in the PRISMA chart [<xref rid="joacp_309_21-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>].

A similar systematic review and meta&#x02010;analysis on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reported high-mortality benefit (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.45; I2 = 0%) in comparison to placebo or no therapy.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] But, the said meta-analysis lacked information about the donor status and the severity of illness in the recipients. Another recent systematic review on CPT in SARS-CoV-2 patients reported mortality benefit with CPT, but relied heavily on case reports and case series, and not on observational studies or clinical trials. They were also unable to explain the variable efficacy of CPT in SARS-CoV-2 due to paucity of quantitative information.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Most of the earlier systematic reviews were based on low quality evidence, whereas our review has moderate quality of evidence. This has been possible in our review due to assessment of bias risk for all determinants, unlike other studies. Another systematic review that failed to elicit any mortality benefit of CPT but concluded it as safe considered the increased oxygen requirement as detrimental to patient safety in the absence of pulmonary involvement. However, the studies demonstrated significant increase in the requirement of oxygen in many patients with extrapulmonary involvement. The same effect was not weighed separately through discrimination tests. But, the most important factor was that the meta-analysis was based upon the CPT use on other severe viral respiratory infections also and the conclusions drawn about SARS-CoV-2.[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>We were also able to gather evidence with regard to early clinical improvement and faster viral clearance after CPT unlike other reviews. Another systematic review reported a significant decrease in viral loads and improvement in clinical symptoms within three to 26 days posttransfusion. But, they included patients with very high volume of plasma transfusion. It is known that too much plasma volume can dilute the concentration of the therapeutic drugs and affect recovery, which can delay viral clearance.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Most of the earlier meta-analyses failed to limit the volume of plasma transfusion because of high heterogeneity. Moreover, the criteria of donor being symptom free for 14 days after recovery from SARS were not reviewed in many meta-analyses.</p><p>Our review found no difference in the oxygen requirement of patients undergoing CPT as against control, and the evidence was moderate. There was no heterogeneity among the studies. But the fact that CPT improves the host microenvironment and promote endogenous repair by inhibiting the overactive immune system can raise expectation about reduced oxygen requirement. Our review suggests the involvement of more complex mechanisms in the genesis of hypoxemia, which CPT alone may fail to redress.</p><p>The lack of adverse effects found low evidence in our meta-analysis that is similar to other reviews and meta-analyses because mild allergic reactions that are very common after CPT are excluded by majority of studies. There can be diagnostic dilemma for effects like fever, chills, circulatory overload, and so on, which are common during natural progression of SARS-CoV-2.[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our meta-analysis has several limitations. First, certain outcome variables like clinical improvement, duration of hospital stay, discharge from hospital, and viral clearance showed considerable heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> statistic: 75&#x02013;100%). So, defining the source of heterogeneity as clinical, methodological, or statistical is important to substantiate these findings.</p><p>Second, we did not weigh the criteria for donor selection before CPT and therefore the level of protection achieved in the recipient varied with changing titers in the donor plasma during CPT. This can also influence mortality besides affecting symptomatic clinical improvement. In other words, conclusive evidence was lacking in these aspects. Lastly, our review relied on evidences collected from moderate to severe patients, and mild to moderate patients were missed. Much evidence accounts for timely and effective administration of CPT in mild SARS-CoV-2 resulting in early recovery and discharge sparing time, effort, and resources for other cases. A detailed subgroup analysis of moderate and severe cases can account for more details.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>CPT appears to be a safe and promising intervention in the management of moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 till date. Despite lacking evidence for any mortality benefit, it can result in faster clinical improvement, diminished oxygen requirement, shorter hospital stay, and earlier discharge thereby sparing resources and manpower for sick patients. Being safe and possessing high ability for viral clearance, its predictability can be used to treat SARS-CoV-2 in severe patients. However, donor selection and timing of CPT administration can be decisive.</p><sec><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" publication-format="print"><person-group person-group-type="author">

In India, two vaccines were released in January 2021, the Covaxin&#x000ae; and the Covishield&#x02122;. However, despite vaccination, many breakthrough infections were reported during the second wave in India. The present cross-sectional study aimed to find out prevalence, severity, and associated risk factors of breakthrough infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) vaccinated against COVID-19.</p></sec><sec><title>Material and Methods:</title><p>After ethical approval and CTRI registration, a validated questionnaire was circulated as Google form-based survey to HCWs across the nation through e-mail over 3 weeks. Biweekly reminders were sent to nonresponders till the desired sample size was attained, after which the survey was closed, and responses were charted. Data obtained from the responses were collated and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1096 HCWs responded to the survey (54.8% response rate) and 23.36% had breakthrough infection. The severity of infection was more in the 30&#x02013;50 years age group (P = 0.0170) and doctors belonging to clinical branches (P = 0.0005). The point estimate for effectiveness in preventing infection was significantly better with Covishield&#x02122; (78.5% vs. 72.4%) (P = 0.0260). Nearly all those who were infected after vaccination thought that vaccination decreased disease severity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Breakthrough COVID-19 infection still occurred after vaccination though the prevalence of severe infection was low. Covishield&#x02122; performed significantly better than Covaxin&#x000ae; in terms of preventing the disease. Clinical branches of medicine were found at a higher risk and younger HCWs or those with comorbidities had a higher severity of the disease.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>health personnel</kwd><kwd>pandemics</kwd><kwd>surveys and questionnaires</kwd><kwd>vaccination</kwd><kwd>vaccines</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the last 100 years, there have been four instances of global pandemics caused by the influenza virus; the current pandemic caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus of the coronavirus family is one of the deadliest. Only the 1918 flu pandemic (Spanish flu) pandemic, with a total death toll of approximately 50 million (500 lakh deaths), was deadlier than this COVID-19 pandemic.[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] With a tally of 53 lakh deaths worldwide, and 4.74 lakh deaths in India (January 2020 till date) alone, and no signs of slowing down, the newly released vaccines are being thoroughly scrutinized and studied across the world by doctors and scientists to ascertain the efficacy of these vaccines by different manufacturers.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In India, two vaccines were released in January 2021, the Covaxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Bharat Biotech; Telangana state, India) and the Covishield&#x02122; (Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd.; Pune, Maharashtra). The Covaxin&#x000ae; is an inactivated dead virus developed using the Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell technology and has demonstrated an overall efficacy of 78% against COVID-19 disease.[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Its efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease was 100% with an impact on reduction in hospitalizations.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Covishield&#x02122;, on the other hand, is a monovalent vaccine composed of a single recombinant, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) vector encoding the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Corona Virus Vaccine (Recombinant); SII) and has an efficacy of 79% against symptomatic COVID-19 when the interval between doses was 4 weeks. More importantly, the efficacy in the cases of severe or critical symptomatic COVID-19 was 100%.[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Fifty percent of our eligible population had been fully vaccinated as of December 10, 2021, whereas 80% has received at least one dose (1,31,18,87,257 doses).[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, emergent circumstances in which the vaccines received approvals for mass use have brought in tentativeness in their acceptance by the general public. Since vaccination is the only definite way of diminishing the effects of the SARS-Cov-2 rampage, the pace and coverage of the inoculation must grow exponentially to achieve epidemiological significance. Prospective data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine would help to build up confidence and increase the adoption of the vaccine by people at large, thereby would potentially help us combat the disease by achieving herd immunity. The second wave of COVID-19 witnessed a common occurrence of infection in those who had received single or double doses of either Covishield&#x02122; or Covaxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> vaccines. This reduced the trust and led to an increasing apprehension about the effectiveness of the vaccines in preventing the deadly disease. Reinfection was also a common reason to worry during the second wave. Healthcare workers (HCWs) stand at a particularly high risk of infection and were the first ones to be vaccinated after the vaccines were made available in India. It is still not clear that which of the two vaccines performs better against the virus.</p><p>We hypothesized that there is no difference in the prevalence and severity of breakthrough infection among HCWs after vaccination with both the available COVID-19 vaccines. The primary objective of this cross-sectional nationwide survey was to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among the vaccinated HCWs. The secondary objectives were to find out the severity of COVID-19 infection postvaccination, the relative clinical effectiveness of Covaxin&#x000ae; and Covishield&#x02122; vaccines, demographic factors impacting their effectiveness, and to evaluate any risk factors for acquiring the disease postvaccination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>After ethical clearance (IEC/VMMC/SJH/Project/2021-05/CC-158), and Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) registration, this prospective, observational, nationwide cross-sectional survey was done. An online semistructured questionnaire was developed to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 infection/reinfection among the HCWs vaccinated with either Covaxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or Covishield&#x02122; vaccines. Breakthrough infection was defined as either a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction report, CT findings suggestive of COVID-19 infection or symptoms after exposure to a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 infection after receiving either one or two doses of Covaxin&#x000ae; or Covishield&#x02122; as a vaccine against COVID-19. Vaccine effectiveness was defined in our study as the number of HCWs who got protected from contracting an infection following vaccination divided by the total number of HCWs who had received the vaccine [i.e., (Total HCWs - HCWs who developed breakthrough infection)/Total HCWs]. This was reported as a percentage and was compared between the two vaccines being studied.</p><p>We performed an extensive literature review using PUBMED, WHO guidelines on COVID, and other databases searching the keywords COVID-19, SARS Cov-2, vaccination, HCWs, Covishield, Covaxin, breakthrough infection, and efficiency. The lacunae in knowledge were identified regarding postvaccine infection in HCWs. Based on our literature review and opinion of stakeholders (HCWs with at least 5 years of experience), a mix of open-ended and multiple-choice questions were framed and then discussed among the expert group. The language of the survey questions was set as simple as possible for easy understanding of everyone including participants like nursing and technical staff. Feedback was sought from technicians and nurses regarding the language, simplicity, and ease of understanding of the survey. The final questionnaire <bold>[<xref rid="App1" ref-type="app">Annexure 1</xref>]</bold> consisted of a set of 29 open-ended and multiple-choice questions which were sent out for validation to a panel of 10 medical professionals from diverse medical specialties. Seven of them responded to our request and graded it as per the instructions laid down. There was a consensus among all seven panelists regarding the structure and content of the self-structured questionnaire. The mean of item-wise content validity index for relevance, simplicity, clarity, and ambiguity was 0.96, 0.95, 0.99, and 0.90 respectively.</p><p>The Kappa statistic for each question (for relevance, simplicity, clarity, and ambiguity) was found to be between 0.75 and 1 in our study, which is considered excellent as per the strength of agreement categorized by Cicchetti.[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The content validity index of the overall scale (S-CVI) is the proportion of individual items which had been given a rating of &#x0201c;very relevant&#x0201d; by all the experts involved. The I-CVI was found to be 0.8, while S-CVI/average was 0.9, which again fully satisfied the validation criteria.[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The suggestions of these experts were incorporated into the final questionnaire, which was then prepared using Google forms, with options of filling the applicable sections. The link to the survey was circulated via e-mails in August 2021. A snowball method of sampling technique was used to disseminate the survey widely across India, and the respondents were requested to forward the link via email further (with all the emails sent further to be carbon-copied (&#x0201c;cc&#x0201d;) to us so that response rate could be known). The HCWs in India comprising of doctors in clinical, preclinical or paraclinical branches, nursing, technical, and support staff who received at least one of the two doses of Covaxin&#x000ae; or Covishield&#x02122;, irrespective of the previous history of infection and were willing to participate in the study were included.</p><p>HCWs in India who did not receive any dose of Covaxin&#x000ae;/Covishield&#x02122; and HCWs who were not conversant with basic English language were excluded. A brief description of the survey was given before participation in the survey and consent was then obtained for voluntary participation. After they consented to take the survey, a set of several mandatory questions appeared sequentially which the participants had to answer. Nonresponders were sent reminders twice a week till the desired sample size was attained (3 weeks), after which the survey was closed and total responses received were pooled, charted, sorted, collated, and evaluated. Anonymity regarding the subject&#x02019;s or the institute&#x02019;s identity was maintained throughout data collection and analysis and the results were kept confidential.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Based on a pilot study done by us on 50 HCWs who were vaccinated with either Covishield or Covaxin, with or without previous history of COVID-19 infection, the infection rate (proportion of HCWs with infection) was 23%. Taking this value as reference, the sample size with a 2.5% margin of error and 5% level of significance was 1089 HCWs, with a two-sided alpha error of 5%. After eliminating incomplete or double responses, we finally got 1096 responses that were analyzed.</p><p>The categorical variables are presented in the form of numbers and percentages (%). The association of the qualitative variables was analyzed using the Chi-square test. A <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> -value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. If any cell had an expected value of &#x0003c; 5, then Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used. The data entry was done in the Microsoft EXCEL spreadsheet and the final analysis was done with the use of Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 21.0 (IBM Inc., Chicago, USA). For statistical significance, a <italic toggle="yes">P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This Google form-based survey was circulated via emails to 2000 HCWs, and we received 1104 responses out of which 1096 were complete, with a response rate of 54.8%. Out of all the HCWs on the frontline, most respondents were doctors 86.4% (64.6% clinical specialities, 21.8% in pre/paraclinical specialities), 5.6% nursing staff, and 8.6% were technical staff and support staff. The respondents were from different states of India and 54.93% were females and 44.62% respondents were males. Among the respondents, 47.9% were in the 20&#x02013;30-year age group, 31.2% in the 30&#x02013;40 age group, 11.59% in the 40&#x02013;50-year age group, 5.84% were between 50 and 60 years, and 3.38% were above 60 years of age. Most of our respondents worked in government medical colleges, 32.57% in private hospitals, and the rest were in either government nonteaching institutes or had a private practice. Among the subjects, 85.13% had no comorbidities and systemic illnesses, whereas 6.11% had hypertension, and 4.56% had diabetes mellitus, while the rest had other systemic illnesses like pulmonary

The prevalence of infection was more in individuals who had received one dose as compared to both the doses. Increased severity of the disease was seen in young HCWs, those with preexisting comorbidities and those belonging to clinical branches.</p><p>Various vaccines are available across the world against COVID-19 with varying efficacy like Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2), Moderna (mRNA-1273), Johnson and Johnson, Oxford-AstraZeneca, etc., In India, Covaxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (BBV152) and Covishield&#x02122; (AZD1222 or ChAdO &#x000d7; 1-S) are approved by the Drug Controller General of India for restricted use in an emergency.[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] For Covaxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (BBV152), the interim results showed the efficacy of 81% in preventing infection in those who have received both doses and not been previously infected by SARS-Cov-2 and 100% efficacy in preventing severe disease if infected.[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Covishield&#x02122; (AZD1222 or ChAdOx1-S) showed a 71% efficacy in preventing infection.[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Data evaluating the effect of vaccination on occurrence of breakthrough infections, decreased transmission, and disease morbidity is sparse at present.</p><p>HCWs in most of the countries including India have been a high-risk population for COVID-19 infection and have been disproportionately more affected by COVID-19.[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] So, HCWs were prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination before the general public starting January 2021.[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In our study, nearly one out of four HCWs (23.36%) reported being infected with COVID-19 during the second wave either as a positive RTPCR report, CT scan findings suggestive of COVID-19 infection, or symptoms after exposure to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive patients. Breakthrough infections after vaccination have been reported in other studies as well with varying prevalence. In India, studies report varying incidence/prevalence from 1.6% by Rana <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] 16.9% by Tyagi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>,[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and 11.94% by Goenka <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The point prevalence in our study (23.36%) was higher since we conducted the survey in a single high-risk population of HCWs, whereas the majority studies had been conducted as a population-based survey or single center incidence studies. In a study by Tyagi <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], 123 employees in a single diabetes center were studied and 16.9% incidence of breakthrough infection was reported after one or two doses of vaccine. Furthermore, we conducted the study once the second wave had just subsided; hence, peak exposure of the HCWs had already happened. The Centre for Disease Control in the USA had also reported breakthrough infections. A study by Hacisuleyman <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported an incidence of breakthrough infection of 0.5% after HCWs received two doses of either Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. Similarly, in the UK, the SIREN study showed decreased the incidence of infection postvaccination.[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Seven percent (78/1096) of all vaccinated HCWs got infected after receiving only one dose of either Covaxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or Covishield&#x02122;, whereas 16.3% (256/1096) had received both doses of either vaccine before they were infected. The probable reasons for a breakthrough infection may be that people who were vaccinated with either Covaxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or Covishield&#x02122; have shown almost 55% fewer antibodies against B.1.617 signature mutations delta variant as compared to those generated against B.1 variant.[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] It may be possible that the person contracted the infection just before the second dose.[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Due to the surge in pandemics during the months of April&#x02013;May, the point prevalence of infected HCWs in our study was high.[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Majority of HCWs contracted the disease while working in hospital, and this shows that hospital-acquired infection rates are higher than the incidence in the community.[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] As a corollary, HCWs who were working in known COVID-19 care areas at the time of infection contracted the disease to a lesser extent as compared to non-COVID-19 which may be due to the protection offered by the use of PPE in known COVID-19 areas.</p><p>Data from different countries suggests that 14&#x02013;19% of COVID-19-infected patients are hospitalized, and 3&#x02013;5% develop severe disease requiring intensive care.[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In our study, the breakthrough infection HCWs was mild in 91%, moderate in 8.2%, and only 0.8% had severe disease.[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Among the infected, 4% required supplemental oxygen and 1.17% needed ICU care, suggesting that vaccination decreased the severity of infection in HCWs. Vaccination decreased the severity of breakthrough infection in other countries also.[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Moreover, PPE compliance was protective in our study because approximately 60% of HCWs who got the breakthrough infection were not wearing PPE at the time of exposure.</p><p>In our study, the severity of infection was more in the younger HCWs (30&#x02013;50 years) (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> = 0.0170) probably because most of them were frontline workers during the peak of pandemic. Many had preexisting comorbidities which increased the severity of infection because of various systemic implications of the disease are known to complicate COVID-19 infection.[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Doctors in clinical branches experienced more breakthrough infections than other branches possibly due to the increased viral exposure in clinical areas.</p><p>Maintaining high vaccination coverage among staff members is also important to reduce opportunities for transmission within hospitals. Moreover, HCWs should continue to follow the recommended infection prevention and control practices regardless of vaccination status. Strengths of the study include that the survey of breakthrough infection postvaccination was conducted on a nationwide level and included a large sample of all categories of HCWs to improve the generalizability of the study. Data collection was done after India had just experienced the peak of the second wave and HCWs had high chances of exposure to the virus.</p><p>Our study had certain limitations. First, deaths among HCW due to COVID-19 have not been taken into consideration in this data. Though it would have been useful information, the survey was a self-administered questionnaire, and it would therefore not have been possible to get this data through the medium of this survey. Second, we did not conduct any laboratory investigation like RTPCR/CT scan/serological tests or collect any medical records for the survey; the data is based on the credibility of the responses by participants and their self-reporting. However, since complete anonymity was maintained, the data collected are expected to be reliable. Third, we did not capture the duration between the dose of vaccine and getting the infection, and this could affect the study outcomes (albeit minimally considering the sample size). Further, recall bias could be a hindrance, but vaccination had started in January end, so the survey was &#x0003c;6 months from the start of vaccination and recall within this period should not be an issue. Lastly, we had designed the survey in simple English only, but a lot of support staff may not be able to complete the survey due to a lack of understanding of English language.</p><p>To conclude, our data indicate that though breakthrough infection after vaccination does occur, possibility of contracting a severe infection is very low. Covishield&#x02122; performed significantly better than Covaxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in terms of effectiveness against the disease. Clinical branches were found to have a higher risk and those with comorbidities had higher severity of the disease. We, therefore, reiterate that these high-risk subgroups should be encouraged to undergo vaccination at the earliest, and despite vaccination, there remains a pressing need to maintain the layers of mitigation strategies such as masking and social distancing.</p><sec><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><title>ANNEXURE</title><p>A nationwide survey on the epidemiology, type of vaccine and risk factors in Healthcare Workers contracting COVID 19 infection postvaccination</p><p>Greetings!</p><p>We are a team of doctors from Safdarjung Hospital and AIIMS in New Delhi conducting this study.</p><p>First of all, a big thank you to all of you for being a frontline warrior against COVID 19 for more than a year now.

It was adapted from the objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the college of medicine, King Saud University (KSU), the OSPE is system oriented and integrated from basic sciences departments, so that the questions are from anatomy, physiology, and pathology departments. The medical curriculum is composed of five years plus an internship year. The college of medicine at KSU conducts a variety of OSCEs throughout the five-year undergraduate program. The first two years are the preclinical years. The courses are integrated between the basic sciences departments, system oriented with problem- based learning (PBL) components and early clinical practice. There are a variety of teaching methods including lectures, practical sessions in the laboratories, early clinical exposure in the clinical skills and simulation center, problem-based learning sessions and self-directed learning. As the teaching methods vary, there are variety of examination methods including written exams, OSCEs, OSPEs and PBL sessions evaluation. In traditional medical curriculum, single course exam is conducted from single discipline, which may lead students to memorize the course materials for short-term retention. In the integrated curriculum, the students must learn the materials, integrate the knowledge, and have an overall understanding of the subjects from different disciplines to encourage integration of the knowledge.</p><p>The OSPE, as the OSCE, is associated in the literature with high stress and anxiety in medical students as well as health sciences students.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> OSCE are well recognized as a method of clinical assessment. This stress may have a negative impact on the performance of the students in the exam.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> Studies have shown that medical students, especially in the first years, reported high levels of stress, anxiety and depression.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It was also shown that it is important to consider possible interventions on the structural level. Institutional interventions may focus on changes within the medical curriculum or the examination that would help in lowering the academic stressors.<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Previous studies have shown that the experience with OSCEs may reduce the students&#x02019; anxiety and therefore improve the performance.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Medical students that participated in mock OSCEs reported benefits in learning, increasing confidences and lower the stress before entering the final exams.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In addition, mock OSCEs improved the performance scores in examination.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A mock OSCE replicates the summative OSCE in the timing, format, layout, length, and station content.<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Peer-led mock OSCEs have shown to improve the students confidence and reduced the stress and anxiety associated with OSCEs.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The peer-assisted teaching has proven to be an effective and less stressful experience in medical education.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Moreover, peer-assisted teaching has shown to be beneficial in developing professionalism and deep understanding of the subjects.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The present study described the design and implementation of peer-led mock OSPE for first- and second-year medical students. The study also investigated the perception of the students of the peer-led mock OSPE and the impact of attending the mock OSPE on the performance in the exam.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at The College of Medicine, King Saud University, ref. no. 21/01098/IRB. Written informed consent was obtained before the study. The study is questionnaire based study and adhered to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>This is a cross-sectional study. The study also evaluated the impact of the mock OSPE on students&#x02019; performance by comparing the results of the students who attended the mock OSPE in 2021 by the results of the medical students that did not attend the mock OSPE.</p><p>Two mock OSPEs were designed and organized by third-, fourth- and fifth-year medical students: foundation block mock OSPE targeting first-year medical students and neuropsychiatry block mock OSPE targeting second-year medical students. Second-year students were included in the mock OSPE as the OSPE was transformed to written OSPE during the pandemic, when the students were in year one. The two mock OSPEs were conducted two days apart. Thirty-three medical students from years three, four, and five organized the exam.</p><p>In the OSPE, the student goes into six stations, spending three minutes at each. The stations were integrated stations from different disciplines and system oriented. Student&#x02019;s performance in OSPE is strongly correlated with their performance in the written examination.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The preparation of the OSPE requires a lot of effort, time and manpower from teachers and laboratory staff.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> But in contrast the OSPE tests much wider subjects and abilities.</p><p>First- and second-year medical students gathered in the waiting rooms, and were given exam instructions. They were then accompanied by their senior peers into the examination laboratory. The exam was conducted in three tracks simultaneously, each consisting of six stations. The time allocated for each station was three minutes. Attendance to the mock OSPEs was open to all first- and second-year medical students, as a list containing the names of all students with their allotted time was distributed through the medical students&#x02019; council&#x02019;s database. Both mock OSPEs were conducted one week before the summative end of block exams. Following the block OSPEs, an online survey was distributed to all participants to assess their satisfaction, quality, and benefits of the mock OSPE. The questionnaire consisted of 18 closed-ended questions that assessed students&#x02019; satisfaction, quality and benefits of the mock OSPE.</p><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Data collected from the survey was analyzed using Microsoft Excel software (version 2013).

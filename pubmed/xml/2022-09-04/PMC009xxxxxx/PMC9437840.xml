In 2005, the ACS expanded their &#x0201c;Statements of Principles of Palliative Care&#x0201d; to broaden palliative care&#x02019;s reach to surgical patients beyond end-of-life care (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Initially focused on cancer patients and those with terminal or life-threatening chronic illnesses, palliative care has proven beneficial for a wider range of seriously-ill patients (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Surgical patients, specifically, are distinct from patients with chronic and/or terminal illnesses in that they often experience rapid changes in health status. Providers with expertise in managing prognostic uncertainty and eliciting patient and family values help by facilitating goal-concordant care at the same time providing relief from the physical and emotional symptoms related to their underlying illnesses and burdensome treatments.</p><p id="P7">However, despite the benefits of palliative care, surgical patients are less likely to receive palliative care consultations when compared to their medical counterparts (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). When palliative care referrals do occur, they are often performed within 24&#x02013;48 hours of death (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), which is associated with poorer symptom control and more aggressive interventions at the end of life (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Recent studies attempt to explain this underuse as a consequence of surgeons&#x02019; misconceptions of the role of palliative care and the discomfort in introducing these services to patients and families. This is largely attributed to a lack of exposure to palliative care during training (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Although these data provide some insight into how surgeons make decisions about the management of seriously-ill and dying patients, much of this work is limited by survey methods and sampling from single institutions or a single surgical subspecialty (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The factors influencing how surgeons employ palliative care approaches (i.e., primary palliative care skills performed by the surgical team), as well as refer to palliative care services (i.e., specialty palliative care support obtained through consultation) is poorly characterized.</p><p id="P8">In this context, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a diverse range of practicing surgeons across the state of Michigan to gain an in-depth understanding of surgeon attitudes and experiences with both palliative care approaches and services. We describe participants&#x02019; perceptions of how, when, and why palliative approaches and services have been and should be utilized with the overall goal of informing strategies to improve the delivery of palliative care to surgical patients.</p><p id="P9">We present the following article in accordance with the MDAR reporting checklist (available at <ext-link xlink:href="10.21037/apm-20-948" ext-link-type="doi">http://dx.doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-948</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Study design</title><p id="P10">This report represents a part of a larger exploratory study designed to gain a comprehensive understanding of how surgeons make decisions about high-risk surgery. High-risk was defined as an increased likelihood of either postsurgical death (i.e., inpatient mortality of at least 1%) or poor outcomes (e.g., unexpected intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospital stay, unanticipated non-home discharge disposition) (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).

Forty-six surgeons from community, tertiary-care, and academic institutions agreed to participate in this study. Participants were selected to represent a diverse cohort with respect to age, gender, race, year in practice, type of practice, and surgical subspecialty (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Participants were eligible if they were a practicing surgeon in the state of Michigan. Participants were monetarily compensated for their participation in the interviews.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Interview procedures</title><p id="P12">All participants were provided with a written or oral informed consent statement and verbally consented before their interview. Individual interviews were conducted in-person or over the phone between October 2018 and April 2019 by two research analysts (CAV and MEB), who have expertise in qualitative interviewing, and the senior author (PAS), a surgeon and health services researcher. Two members of the research team (CAV and PAS) designed an exploratory interview guide to explore high risk decision-making for older adult (&#x0003e;65 years) patients (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplement 1</xref>). Participants were asked to walk the interviewer through the steps they would take in making decisions about high-risk surgery. Participants were further prompted to consider the following as they relate to how decisions are made about high-risk surgery: the role of preoperative cognitive and functional status; the role of post-operative complications including cognitive and functional outcomes; barriers and facilitators to use of palliative care services; and surgeon responses after an unexpected post-operative outcome or complication. Three iterations of the interview guide were generated and piloted based on content validity, and presentation and clarity of information. All data, including those collected during pilot interviews, were included in the final data analysis. All interviews were digitally recorded and lasted between 30 and 60 minutes. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim and de-identified for names and places. Transcripts were not returned to participants for review.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Analysis</title><p id="P13">The data were analyzed through iterative steps informed by thematic analysis (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Five members of the research team independently identified an initial set of codes. The team then met to discuss the codes and map them to a coding schema, creating a codebook based on overarching domains. Due to the exploratory nature of the interview instrument, the initial coding process was kept intentionally broad, and focused on organizing data into overarching domains. Two members of the research team (CAV and ACD) independently coded transcripts, meeting regularly to discuss discrepancies and modify the codebook when necessary. From there, each domain was assigned to a research member based on research interest. A codebook for the palliative care domain was created iteratively with involvement from the entire research team. Transcribed interviews were coded in MAXQDA (version 18.2.3, VERBI Software, Berlin, Germany), a computer-assisted, qualitative data analysis software. Microsoft Excel (version 16.16.20, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) was used to assist with synthesizing and categorizing results.</p><p id="P14">This study was deemed exempt by the University of Michigan Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRBMED HUM00157651).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Results</title><p id="P15">Six major themes emerged describing surgeon-reported barriers to palliative care approaches and use of palliative care services, which were observed at the surgeon-level, patient and family-level, and system-level.</p><p id="P16">At the <italic toggle="yes">surgeon</italic>-<italic toggle="yes">level</italic>, the following three major themes emerged:

For many, this was due to limited education and training surrounding palliative care. Participants described how exposure to goals of care discussions were often limited to informal training experiences, modeled by senior residents or surgeons over the course of their training, which were inherently variable. Very few reported undergoing training with experts in the management of complex, seriously-ill, or dying patients. In addition to the lack of formal training, participants also asserted a lack of knowledge regarding the palliative care services available at their institution, including uncertainty in what exactly the palliative care team would provide, as well as more logistical concerns, such as how and when to call them.
<disp-quote id="Q1"><p id="P28">&#x0201c;I think barriers are more in terms of, I think I mentioned it a little before in terms of palliative care, is the lack of education of the physicians in the hospital as to what those services are. You know, what is palliative care? What are they going to do? Because obviously, patients and family members I think aren&#x02019;t necessarily aware of what that is, but I think sometimes the physicians aren&#x02019;t even sure what that is exactly. Do I call palliative care when they&#x02019;re, you know, at what point do you call them? So, there&#x02019;s lack of education.&#x0201d;</p><attrib>(ID 2).</attrib></disp-quote></p><p id="P29">Participant beliefs were also influenced by personal experiences with palliative care teams, with some stating that their experiences interacting with specialty services for their own loved one influenced their perceptions about the benefits of palliative care.</p><p id="P30">Several participants alluded to cultural and generational shifts in improved knowledge and awareness of involving palliative care services. Younger generations of surgeons were described as being more agreeable to palliative care, noted by increased discussions and openness with patients and families within surgical contexts. This cultural shift was attributed to palliative care exposure as early as medical school and residency, as well as the evolution of the field of hospice and palliative medicine as a medical subspecialty over the last several decades. As one participant described:
<disp-quote id="Q2"><p id="P31">&#x0201c;I think older generation surgeons have a misunderstanding, don&#x02019;t know enough about it, don&#x02019;t involve it enough.&#x0201d;</p><attrib>(ID 6).</attrib></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Prognostication challenges</title><p id="P32">Participants described challenges in the ability to predict the future, especially when health status can shift quickly post-surgery. For some, the decision to not refer to palliative care services was influenced by prior experiences of patients who made a full recovery despite a low likelihood of survival.
<disp-quote id="Q3"><p id="P33">&#x0201c;And I can actually, this 27-year-old guy I can think of right now who is like now 37 and going to work today, you know?

For these patients, participants described greater confidence in the patient&#x02019;s inability to recover, leading to a greater tendency to discuss nonoperative options or initiate referrals.</p></sec><sec id="S15"><title>Surgeon identity</title><p id="P35">Participants described how the <italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;fixer&#x0201d;</italic> identity of the surgeon played a significant role in surgeons&#x02019; willingness to discuss nonoperative management or involve palliative care services.

<disp-quote id="Q4"><p id="P36">&#x0201c;I&#x02019;ve had surgeons that just weren&#x02019;t kind of, were used to being able to fix things, and it&#x02019;s kind of that, like you don&#x02019;t want to, even patients who are really sick, like trauma patients or something, we could usually do something to make them better.&#x0201d;</p><attrib>(ID 4).</attrib></disp-quote></p><p id="P37">The perceived role of the surgeon also influenced relationships with patients and families, with participants asserting the perception that patients and/or families viewed conversations around palliative care as the surgeon giving up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Patient and family-level barriers</title><sec id="S17"><title>Expectations</title><p id="P38">Participants described scenarios in which patients&#x02019; and families&#x02019; <italic toggle="yes">unrealistic expectations</italic> prevented them from considering palliative care because the patient and/or family did not or could not anticipate a poor outcome or prolonged recovery. For example, one surgeon reflected on the frequently held belief of patients and families that &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">if you just operate and take it out</italic>,&#x0201d; then &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">all would be fine</italic>.&#x0201d; <italic toggle="yes">(ID 2)</italic> Such expectations were described as patients&#x02019; and families&#x02019; desire to do any intervention possible, at any expense, no matter how small the chance of meaningful recovery. This optimism sometimes prevented participants from initiating palliative care conversations when they thought they should.
<disp-quote id="Q5"><p id="P39">&#x0201c;The biggest roadblock that I encounter on a day-to-day basis is everyone thinks that whatever condition they have is something that we&#x02019;re going to be able to cure and that it&#x02019;s not going to impact their longevity.&#x0201d;</p><attrib>(ID 1).</attrib></disp-quote></p><p id="P40">Conversely, participants reported that having ongoing, open communication helped prevent palliative care referrals from being a surprise to the family and helped to build trust and rapport.

That&#x02019;s what they&#x02019;re interested in. I&#x02019;m not interested in that. I want to solve every problem and have you get better and get back to being better than you were before.

<disp-quote id="Q8"><p id="P47">&#x0201c;Palliative care I think is complicated because families oftentimes think that they&#x02019;re interchangeable with hospice and they can potentially get offended if you suggest that we get a palliative care team involved.

It is further impacted by the contemporaneous societal expectations of what their role should be. Atul Gawande has described the evolution of the definition of surgeon in Webster&#x02019;s dictionary: in 1913, a surgeon was defined as &#x0201c;one whose profession or occupation is to cure diseases or injuries of the body by manual operation (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>),&#x0201d; whereas today it is defined as &#x0201c;a medical specialist who practices surgery (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).&#x0201d; Many of the subjects in our study perceived their roles similarly to the antiquated version, as &#x0201c;fixers,&#x0201d; indicating that they identify with surgery for its technical role in medicine, as opposed to the role of a physician who treats diseases and the person as a whole. Perhaps, it is in this dated sense of identity, that many surgeons today continue to grapple with the integration of approaches introduced by newer medical specializations such as palliative care medicine, which only became formally recognized by the American Board of Medical Subspecialties in 2006.</p><p id="P55">The decision of whether to pursue curative or palliative intent surgery versus comfort care is a time-intensive and emotionally taxing venture. The constraints of limited and divided time between the operating room, other daily demands of surgical practice, and dedicated time for patient counseling can limit the robustness of these conversations between patients, loved ones, and surgeons. This directly impacts prioritizing patient autonomy and shared decision making, core principles of surgical palliative care. Given the overall increase in emergency surgeries in the United States (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), communication tools for surgeons working in high-pressure, high-stakes environments are paramount. Communication and goal concordant care conceptual models have been adapted for critically-ill patients (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and measure the context and delivery of communication between clinicians and patients. However, data on the efficacy of these tools are minimal (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and require more intensive study on its implementation to better understand their effects.</p><p id="P56">Unsurprisingly, communication was frequently discussed in tandem with the theme of prognostication challenges (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Technology and research continue to advance the field of surgery as do prognostication tools, nomograms, and risk calculators, which can assist surgeons in decision making. Many participants described the two extremes of palliative care&#x02014;circumstances characterized as &#x0201c;gray areas&#x0201d;, wherein prognostic tools are of little use, versus extremes of circumstances, wherein death or recovery are believed to be more likely (e.g., traumatic injury in older patients). These data reinforce a previously reported finding, that when uncertainty prevails and surgeon&#x02019;s confidence decreases, there is the potential for negative consequences on subsequent decision-making and referrals to palliative care (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p id="P57">Surgeon-reported perceptions of limited palliative care services within their home institutions contributed to consult underutilization, despite the significant expansion of hospital palliative care services in the last decade (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Smaller hospitals are less likely than larger ones to staff a palliative care team, highlighting the need for non-palliative care specialists to be formally trained in palliative medicine, and perhaps, specifically, surgeons due to their central role in caring for patients during critical illness. Furthermore, surgeons working at smaller hospitals may lack the same access to opportunities for observation as participants in this study, who reported learning palliative care approaches from other surgeons. These limitations to palliative care knowledge highlight the need for more educational opportunities for surgeons during training and beyond. Studies have shown that residents demonstrate increasing interest and willingness to learn about palliative care principles (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Immersive palliative care training programs can significantly improve residents&#x02019; knowledge, attitudes, and skills (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), and structured teaching can improve junior residents&#x02019; knowledge to be similar to those who have learned experientially (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p id="P58">Many participants who had prior exposure to and/or training in palliative care approaches described the use of services as limited to &#x0201c;third party&#x0201d; roles in facilitating communication and establishing goals of care. These remarks assume the role of palliative care as an adjunct, rather than a core component of standard surgical practices, contradicting the established principles set forth by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Surgical Palliative Care (ACS CSPC) for advanced and serious illness (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Although data from this study suggest that younger generations of surgeons are more aware of the need to involve palliative care services, little is known regarding the use of palliative care approaches among surgeons without specialty palliative care training.</p><p id="P59">There were limitations to this study that should be addressed. Inherent to qualitative research, our study sample is not generalizable to all surgeons or practice settings. However, we purposively sampled a diverse cohort by specialty, age, experience, and practice setting. Further, social desirability bias may influence some responses about their typical approaches to high-stakes decision making, as surgeons may feel there is a &#x0201c;correct answer&#x0201d; to some of these questions. Despite this possibility, many of the participants were interviewed through the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative, which is a community of surgeons that have exhibited high vulnerability in past studies and interactions in an effort to improve care for surgical patients across Michigan. Finally, in pursuit of drawing out participants&#x02019; complete understanding of palliative care, we did not specifically ask about their understanding of the differences between primary palliative care approaches and palliative care services. However, we have no reason to believe that the lack of standardized definitions provided to the participants would alter their responses to the challenges they encounter when communicating and managing seriously ill and complex patients.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P60">Our study adds to the growing body of literature identifying surgeon-reported barriers to the use of palliative care approaches and services among surgical patients. Our research strives to elevate the understanding surgeon experiences that will further aid in the implementation of much needed strategies to better assist surgeons&#x02019; use of palliative approaches and consultative services for their patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM1"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS1832190-supplement-1.pdf" id="d64e535" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S24"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p id="P61">The authors would like to thank the participants who participated in these interviews and the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative for assistance recruiting surgeon subjects and promoting this study.</p><sec id="S25"><title>Funding:</title><p id="P62">This project was funded by the Thomas R.

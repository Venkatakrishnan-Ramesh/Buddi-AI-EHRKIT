Faced with the challenge of entering a higher school and the expectations of their families and teachers, such candidates are often under great psychological pressure. According to a large sample survey in China, the main source of pressure for high school students is the good grades required to enter a higher school.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Under the effect of internal and external pressures, these students often undergo negative emotions such as academic anxiety,<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> which refers to an emotional state in which the individual cannot overcome difficulties or reach the goal.<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> During the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, schools in various regions of China could not open normally, and students who were in the second semester of senior high school of grade 3 had to study online at home as they were preparing for the college entrance examination. The main purpose of physical distancing is to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it can cause isolation, loneliness, and even mental health problems.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This could also have exacerbated the academic anxiety of some students, especially those who were probably lacking self-control and eager to succeed.<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>In recent years, many studies have focused on the relationship between anxiety and self-esteem.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Self-esteem, which refers to an individual&#x02019;s overall emotional evaluation of his own value and importance, is related to the individual emotional experience.<xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Positive emotions have been found to promote the development of self-esteem, while negative emotions can weaken the level of self-esteem,<xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and emotional experiences can also be transformed into self-esteem under specific conditions.<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Regarding college entrance examination candidates, academic anxiety is not a short-term emotional state, but a long-term one. In addition, the existing research shows that anxiety is negatively correlated with internal motivation and positively correlated with external motivation,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Meanwhile, self-regulated learning ability focuses on describing the individual internal motivation for learning. Self-regulated learning is to monitor individual learning motivation and execute the learning process.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> As stress is unavoidable in one&#x02019;s life, self-regulation is essential for effective coping and developing healthy emotions.<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The self-regulated learning ability of individuals with high anxiety may be relatively weak. In addition, senior high school students display more explicit internal motivation and self-regulated learning ability than junior high school and primary school students.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Self-regulated learning ability can also play a good role in promoting the effectiveness of online learning.<xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>It is evident from previous research that academic anxiety can affect individual self-esteem and self-regulated learning ability.<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that self-regulated learning ability may be the mediator between academic anxiety and self-esteem. This study was intended to test this mediating relationship. A questionnaire survey was adopted to explore the relationship between academic anxiety and self-esteem of college entrance examination candidates and determine the role of self-regulated learning ability in the relationship between academic anxiety and self-esteem during COVID-19. This study aimed to better understand the status of academic anxiety among students, provide a reference for psychological counseling for students, and expand the field of research on the mental health of these students. We hypothesized that. 1) academic anxiety of college entrance examination candidates had a significant negative predictive effect on self-esteem. 2) there was a significant correlation between academic anxiety, self-regulated learning ability, and self-esteem. 3) self-regulated learning ability played a mediating role between academic anxiety and self-esteem.</p></sec><sec id="s0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s0002-s2001"><title>Study Setting</title><p>A voluntary, web-based and structured questionnaire was conducted on the &#x0201c;Questionnaire Star&#x0201d; platform, which is an e-questionnaire app widely used in China, to measure the academic anxiety, self-regulated learning ability and self-esteem level of candidates for the college entrance examination in the middle of May 2020. The questionnaire items were sent to three independent professors in this field to review the topic coverage and relevance before full implementation.

Firstly, the participants of this study were students who were about to participate in the college entrance examination. They belonged to a special population within a specific age range and with important development tasks. They were in a state of stress for a long time before the college entrance examination. Continuous anxiety could have had a certain impact on their psychological structures, which could reduce individual evaluations of their self-esteem and cause a decrease in their levels of self-esteem.<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> According to the core-periphery theory (CPT) of self-esteem, the self-esteem system consists of two core elements: self-confidence and sense of self-worth. This survey was carried out during the COVID-19 prevalence period. Students were unable to enter the schools, communicate face to face with teachers or classmates, or take mock exams organized by the schools.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Students may have felt great uncertainty about their academic performance and learning ability, which would have directly affected their self-confidence and sense of self-worth, and self-esteem.</p></sec><sec id="s0004-s2002"><title>Academic Anxiety Influences the Self-Esteem Levels of College Entrance Examination Candidates Through Self-Regulated Learning Ability</title><p>The results show that academic anxiety can directly impact the self-esteem levels of the college entrance examination candidates and affect self-esteem through the mediating effect of self-regulated learning ability. Self-regulated learning is critical during a pandemic because it could help adolescents adjust their learning plan and better adapt to changes in their lives.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Students with good self-regulated learning ability always know what they lack and have clear learning motivation.<xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Individuals with low academic anxiety tend to adopt effective internal regulation strategies to improve their self-esteem levels. Individuals with high academic anxiety have higher external motivation but fewer internal regulation strategies, so their self-esteem levels are lower. This is consistent with the results of previous research. Many theoretical and empirical studies have shown that self-regulated learning ability is significantly related to anxiety.<xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Negative emotions damage the cognitive ability and internal motivation of individuals.<xref rid="cit0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Some individuals can successfully eliminate negative emotions through internal self-regulation and obtain a higher level of self-esteem.<xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The possible reasons are given below. On the one hand, self-regulated learning ability not only reflects the specific behavior strategies of the learners in the learning process and the excellent quality of the learners to actively deal with academic pressure.<xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The research on the relationship between negative life events and self-esteem found that positive coping can mediate the relationship between life events and self-esteem; on the contrary, negative coping can reduce self-worth.<xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> When college entrance examination candidates experience academic anxiety and adjust their self-learning in time, such as through learning motivation and metacognition, they can effectively deal with psychological pressure and ease individual academic anxiety. On the other hand, some studies have found that positive academic emotions are related to self-regulation, while negative academic emotions are significantly and positively related to external regulation. Further, negative academic emotions reduce the academic motivation of the students, make the students rely too much on external guidance and then deny their ability and value of existence, resulting in low self-esteem.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study examined the mediating role of self-regulated learning ability in the relationship between academic anxiety and self-esteem of senior high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results clarify the internal mechanism of influence of academic anxiety on self-esteem and enrich the research in the field of mental health of college entrance examination candidates. In addition, the current study also has important guiding significance in forming of good self-esteem among these candidates. At the same time, the study also has the following two shortcomings. Firstly, it was a cross-sectional study and lacked data from a longitudinal sample, so it is difficult to draw causal inferences. Secondly, in addition to the self-regulated learning ability proposed in the study, there may also be some other mediators or moderators such as attributional biases<xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and coping styles<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> that could affect the relationship between academic anxiety and self-esteem levels of high school students. Due to the limited research time, we did not include these variables in the study. These variables could be included in future studies to explore further the internal mechanism of academic anxiety that affects the levels of self-esteem of high school students in a more systematic model.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study indicated that the self-regulated learning ability of college entrance examination candidates partially mediates the relationship between academic anxiety and the self-esteem of the candidates. These findings suggest an underlying process by which low academic anxiety may increase self-esteem in candidates preparing for the college entrance examination by increasing self-regulated learning ability. The school staff could help students get through this challenging period by encouraging and supporting them. In addition, guiding students to set up their own support system can also be helpful.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" id="s0007"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors declared no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Fu</surname>

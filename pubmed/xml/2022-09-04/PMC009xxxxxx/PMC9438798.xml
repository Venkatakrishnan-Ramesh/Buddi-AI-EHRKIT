All animal experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Regulation for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals (Ministry of Science and Technology, China, 1988, revised in march 2017). Eight-weeks-old BKS - db/db mice and C57BL/KSJ wild-type (WT) mice were purchased from Jiangsu Jicui Yaokang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. A db/db mouse with a tail-tip vein blood glucose level &#x0003e; 13 mmol/L was described as a diabetic mouse. After 7 days of adaptive feeding, the mice were divided into four groups: (1) the NC group, which included normal healthy individuals as control (n = 10); (2) the MD group, which included untreated db/db mice (n = 10); (3) the SAL group, which included db/db mice treated with SAL (n = 10); (4) the MET group, which included db/db mice treated with metformin (MET). SAL was purchased from Chengdu Refines Biotechnology Co., Ltd., and MET hydrochloride was purchased from China-US Shanghai Squibb Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Intragastric administration was performed each day with 400 mg/kg of MET in the MET group. Intragastric administration of 200 mg/kg SAL was applied to the SAL group in the same way. To minimize the influence of gastric perfusion, mice in the healthy control group and the untreated db/db group were given the same volume of normal saline. Drug intervention lasted for eight weeks. During the observation period, the blood glucose levels in the mice were detected by a blood glucose meter (ACCU-CHEK) every week, and the weight of the mice was monitored using a weigh scale (Lucky). At the end of the 8th week, four groups (SAL, MET, NC, MD) of fecal specimens were collected and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. At the end of the observation period, all animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and bled. GraphPad Prism 8.3.0 and R 4.1.3 were used for graphing and statistical analysis.

Specifically, this finding suggests that fecal microbiota functional alterations, especially in metabolism, may play key roles in the pathogenesis and development of T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="s0003-s2003"><title>Changes in Gut Microbiota are Closely Related to Physiological Parameters in db/db Mice</title><p>Recent studies have shown that different treatments affect the intestinal microbiota of mice, but whether the differences in the intestinal microbiota of db/db mice in the administration group were related to the changes in these physiological and biochemical indexes was unknown. In this study, RDA was performed to evaluate the relationship between diabetes-related physiological and biochemical markers and the gut microbiota. RDA is a combination of correspondence analysis and multiple regression analysis that is used to evaluate the relationship between environmental factors and the gut microbiota. According to the length of the connection between the environmental factors and the origin, blood glucose levels, body weight and insulin levels had the greatest influence on the microbiota structure in diabetic mice (<xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, there was mutual influence between different environmental factors, and blood glucose levels was negatively correlated with INS and C-P levels. The RDA analyses suggested that the key functional bacteria associated with T2DM are actively involved in the regulation of blood glucose and body weight in diabetic mice.<fig position="float" id="f0003" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Redundancy analysis (RDA) of relative abundance of bacteria with environmental factors in each group. *Top 10 genera responding to environmental variables.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DMSO-15-2619-g0003" content-type="print-only" position="float"/><attrib><bold>Notes</bold>: The arrows represent the relative positions of different environmental factors on the plane, and the longer the arrow, the greater the effect.

Different drug treatments resulted in significant changes in the relative abundances of 69 species of bacteria (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, it is difficult to distinguish their importance, so we used a random forest algorithm to identify the characteristic microbiota in response to diabetes, ranked the microbiota according to MeanDecreaseAccuracy, and selected the top 7 genera with the highest accuracy contribution as the major bacteria involved in diabetes (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The Pearson method was used to analyze the correlation between the abundance of 7 genera and diabetes-related indicators (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). A predictive model was generated based on their relative abundances to identify target samples. Characteristic microbiota were identified in this study using ROC curves, which can be used to classify the performance of biomarker analysis (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). The comprehensive results showed that Staphylococcus (AUC: 0.944), Candidatus arthromitus (AUC: 0.931), and Odoribacter (AUC: 0.833) were the most critical genera related to diabetes, and the abundances of these three key genera were significantly correlated with the levels of physiological parameters. Although the AUC value achieved using Staphylococcus abundance was very high, Staphylococcus abundance had a strong correlation with INS in the correlation analysis, but it did not appear in the heatmap (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) or STAMP (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), so it was not regarded as a key genus.<fig position="float" id="f0004" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Identification of the signature gut microbiota, associated with diabetes, by random forest method.

Microbial &#x003b1;-diversity analysis showed that the community diversity in mice in the MD and drug administration groups was lower than that in healthy mice, indicating that diabetes alters the diversity of intestinal microbiota in mice.

During the study, the intervention of SAL and MET both sdecreased the &#x003b1; diversity of intestinal microbiota. Our PCA could be used to distinguish mice with T2DM from healthy controls, but the drug-treated and model groups could not be completely distinguished, indicating that the intestinal microbiota profiles of the drug-treated groups were similar. The study by Liu et al<xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> suggested that changes in body composition are associated with metabolic abnormalities, and metabolic disorders exist in patients with T2DM. Differential KO pathway enrichment analysis showed that multiple pathways were related to metabolism, indicating that diabetes is indeed related to metabolic disorders and suggesting that SAL and MET can alleviate the symptoms of type 2 diabetes by regulating the body&#x02019; s metabolism.</p><p>Our RDA results indicated that insulin levels, body weight, and blood glucose levels were significantly associated with changes in gut microbiota at the genus level.

Almost all patients with T2DM or metabolic syndrome (MS) in the study by Masarone et al<xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> had nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

In this study, the liver, kidney and pancreas of db/db mice were damaged, which was consistent with the results of previous studies. Both SAL and MET have protective and reparative effects on the liver, kidney and pancreas damage caused by diabetes in db/db mice, and can alleviate and improve the pathological process of diabetes.</p><p>In this study, RDA analysis showed that insulin level, body weight and blood glucose level could significantly affect the changes in gut microbiota at the genus level. It was demonstrated that insulin levels, body weight, and blood glucose play crucial roles in the separation and aggregation of each group of samples, and these three physiological parameters are highly correlated with the development and treatment of diabetes. Studies have shown that the insulin level in db/db mice was higher than that in normal mice. In this study, the blood glucose levels, body weight and insulin levels in db/db mice treated with SAL were lower than those in MD mice. H&#x00026;E-stained sections of liver and kidney tissues provided evidence that SAL had protective and reparative effects on liver and kidney damage caused by diabetes in db/db mice, and could alleviate and improve the pathological process of diabetes.</p><p>Specifically, we found that Candida arthromitus and Odoribacter were the most important taxa of T2DM and thus could be potential therapeutic targets. The relative abundances of Candidatus arthromitus and Odoribacter showed large differences among the groups in the differential bacterial heatmap (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), LEfSe (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) and STAMP (<xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="f0002" ref-type="fig">F</xref>) analyses. Analysis of the correlation between abundance and diabetes-related insulin levels, body weight and blood sugar levels revealed that Candidatus arthromitus and Odoribacter abundances were significantly correlated with blood sugar levels and body weight (P &#x0003c; 0.001). When using the ROC curve to discriminate the characteristic microbiota, the use of the three microbiota components performed equally well (AUCs greater than 0.8). Odoribacter is a short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) -producing genus of Bacteroidetes.<xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> SCFAs influence energy homeostasis, glucose homeostasis, and psychiatric disorders through the gut-brain axis or directly through the central pathway.<xref rid="cit0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> The relative abundance of Odoribacter was found to be significantly reduced in the gut microbiota of high-fat, high-sugar diet-induced obese mice.<xref rid="cit0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> The abundance of Odoribacter was decreased in the MD group in this study, and the relative abundance of Odoribacter was increased in db/db mice after treatment with SAL and MET. This finding implies that Odoribacter directly affects the occurrence of T2DM. Candidatus arthromitus is a candidate gut-protective organism with metabolic and/or immune interactions.<xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> The relative abundance of Candidatus arthromitus was found to be significantly increased in the feces of depressed rats<xref rid="cit0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> and nonobese diabetic (NOD)<xref rid="cit0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> mice. Candidatus arthromitus abundance was increased in the MD group, which is consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). After SAL administration, the abundance of Candidatus arthromitus decreased. This findings suggests that the changes in the genus Candidatus arthromitus may be caused by T2DM, and that SAL regulates the key microbiota related to diabetes and improves the disease pathology. These microbiota components are inextricably linked to diabetes mellitus, and correcting the imbalance in the intestinal microbiota may become a new goal for the prevention and treatment of T2DM. It is worth mentioning that although this study describes changes in the gut microbiome and physiopathology and the relationship between the two in db/db mice after SAL and MET treatment, we cannot directly explain their causal relationship. We hope to investigate further in the future in more in-depth molecular mechanism studies.</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using SAL and MET intervention in diabetic mice, we found that SAL can significantly improve kidney, liver and pancreatic damage in diabetic mice, thereby playing a protective role. SAL has a certain effect on the structure and function of the intestinal microbiota of mice. After administration, the structure and function of the intestinal microbiota of db/db mice changed, and the activation levels of multiple metabolic pathways changed. Candidatus arthromitus and Odoribacter are highly associated with T2DM and may be potential targets for the treatment of diabetes. Our study can serve as a new perspective for future diabetes treatment through targeted and precise modulation of the microbiota.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Qin Zhao and Jing Shi should be considered co-first authors.

Irreducible unstable odontoid fractures are more common in young patients with high-impact and high-velocity trauma when strong disruptive forces act upon the osseoligamentous complex at the base of the skull. These may be associated with significant cord injury and associated trauma (brain, viscera, and long bones). Following diagnosis, immediate attempt to realign the bones with skull traction is a standard procedure. The absence of standard guidelines about traction and a small but certain chance of devastating deterioration following traction are causes of concern, and most surgeons would plan early surgical realignment and stabilization. Transoral decompression followed by posterior stabilization has been the main option. Posterior manipulation and realignment with fixation in properly selected cases has been described recently. Open reduction internal fixation by a single-stage unilateral direct anterior extrapharyngeal approach may be another option for successful fracture realignment and atlantoaxial fixation resulting in solid bony fusion in unstable, irreducible odontoid fractures.</p><sec id="s2"><title>Study Description</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Between February 2011 and December 2020, we surgically treated 15 patients with unstable odontoid fractures with irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation. Fractures were considered irreducible after they remained displaced and irreducible in spite of a 3-day trial of skull traction up to 12 kg. Mechanisms of trauma included motorcycle accidents (9 patients), high-speed car accidents (2 patients), diving (2 patients), and falls from high heights (2 patients). Most were males (13 males/2 females; ages: 21&#x02013;64 years), and 13 patients were less than 40 years old. Twelve patients underwent surgery within 3 days of injury, and the remaining 3 patients underwent surgery within 10 days of injury. Skull traction (Gardner-Wells tongs) was applied in all cases, and a trial of 3 days was given to 5 patients. Over the years, we realized the success of the procedure to realign almost all fractures and started taking patients earlier for surgery. None had realigned before surgery.</p><p>Apart from routine investigations for fitness for surgery, all patients underwent lateral radiographs for diagnosis and reducibility after traction and computerized axial tomography (CT) scanning with bone window settings and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction to study the displacement of the fracture fragment and the facetal malalignment (atlantoaxial dislocation), other fractures, and bone stock for length of screws required. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to study cord injury, and magnetic resonance angiography was performed for vertebral artery position and associated spinal cord trauma.</p><p>Informed consent for surgery was obtained from all patients and next of kin. Institutional review board approval was not necessary, as surgical treatment is the standard of care for most unstable odontoid fractures. The surgical approach and implants have been used before, and the results have been extensively published in the literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Operative Technique</title><p>Following general anesthesia and fiber optic intubation, the patient was positioned supine on a radiolucent table compatible for intraoperative radiography. The head was fixed with adhesive tape in mild extension with a minimal tilt to the left side sparing the skull traction without weights (Gardner-Wells) applied earlier, so that it could be available for manipulation intraoperatively. A unilateral right-side, submandibular extrapharyngeal approach was used to reach the fracture site where fracture hematoma could be identified. The anterior longitudinal ligament was divided, and longus coli muscles were dissected away from midline to expose the anterior surface of the arch of atlas, odontoid process, body of axis. The lateral masses of the atlas, atlantoaxial joints, and the superior facets of the axis were exposed bilaterally, which sometimes required division of the longus coli and longus capitis up to the lateral border of the joints; removal of soft tissue and synovial joint between the anterior arch of the atlas and odontoid (which may require drilling of the inferior half of the rim of the atlas) and opening the atlantoaxial facet joint capsule generously on both sides aided the loosening of the deformity. The fracture site was opened and manipulated into correct alignment (both anterior facet edges of the atlas and axis were in the same sagittal and coronal planes) using the skull traction for manipulation under &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; arm guidance.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduction Techniques</title><p>In anterior displacements, distracting the atlantoaxial joints using a 5-mm osteotome passed into the joint for 1 cm and tilted to lever the lateral mass of the atlas upward and backward resulted in reduction and realignment (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="f1"><label>FIG. 1.</label><caption><p><bold>A:</bold> Identifying the joint space below the lateral mass of the atlas (anatomical drawing). <bold>B:</bold> Inserting osteotome for manipulation (anatomical drawing). <bold>C:</bold> Rotating the osteotome to open the joint and push and realign the atlas upward and backward (anatomical drawing). <bold>D:</bold> Repositioned and realigned facet joint (anatomical drawing). <bold>E:</bold> Intraoperative identification of joint space with a microcurette below the anteriorly and inferiorly displaced lateral mass of atlas over the superior facet of the axis. <bold>F:</bold> Intraoperative fluoroscopic image of microdrill in atlantoaxial joint space. <bold>G:</bold> Intraoperative image of osteotome in atlantoaxial joint space to manipulate and realign the atlantoaxial facets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CASE21501f1" position="float"/></fig><p>In posterior or coronal displacements, drilling a 3-mm hole and securing a tap for 5&#x02013;8 mm (depending upon thickness of bone seen on preoperative CT) into the distal fragment or anterior tubercle of the atlas permitted manipulation for achieving the correct anatomical position of the facet joints.

The midpoint of the C2 lateral mass was identified, and the entry point chosen was 5 mm inferomedial to the midpoint, and with a 3.5-mm drill bit, a hole was drilled directed to the upper outer limit of the C1 lateral mass with a 25&#x02013;30&#x000b0; downward tilt (intraoperative &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; arm imaging used to confirm trajectory) toward the upper posterior end of the lateral mass.

Three had associated brain injuries and prolonged loss of consciousness with associated polytrauma; these patients could not be assessed adequately and underwent surgery after stabilization and treatment of other trauma; they required tracheostomy and Ryles tube feeding for 4 weeks and were eventually discharged with significant disability that necessitated use of a wheelchair and constant care for activities of daily living. Two patients had postoperative transient right hypoglossal weakness for 3&#x02013;12 days, 3 had persistent postoperative neck and occipital pain for 2 months, which required analgesics. One patient had preoperative dysphagia after the injury and also developed hypoglossal weakness, which worsened the dysphagia and required Ryles tube feeding for 2 weeks, but had a complete recovery. One patient died 3 weeks after surgery due to acute myocardial infarction, unrelated to surgery. No patient needed intraoperative transfusion, and no surgery lasted more than 180 minutes. Except for the unrelated mortality, anatomical realignment of the fracture with fusion without implant failure was observed in 100% of the patients at 6 months.

Some complex unstable odontoid fractures are displaced, impacted with deformity, which may be irreducible with preoperative skull traction. There are no established guidelines for the amount of weight or duration for preoperative skull traction in complex unstable odontoid fractures, and traction can occasionally be disastrous.<sup><xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> These require early surgical realignment and stabilization.<sup><xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Unstable displaced odontoid fractures result from severe hyperflexion or hyperextension forces, which cause the fracture and additional injury of the longitudinal part of the cruciate ligament but preserved transverse ligament and resultant displacement of the distal fragment of the odontoid, along with the atlas, anteriorly or posteriorly with facetal malalignment.<sup><xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In most displaced odontoid fractures, the atlantodental interval is preserved even in those with significant anteroposterior displacement or angulation of the distal fragment, implying that the transverse alar ligament is preserved and the vertical component of the cruciate ligament is disrupted at its lower attachment and can be missed in routine MRI and CT imaging.<sup><xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The extent of instability in odontoid fractures is a function of loss of facetal relationship best seen on parasagittal CT scanning at the midsagittal level of both the joints with 3D reconstruction of the atlantoaxial complex.<sup><xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Irreducibility in these displaced fractures is multifactorial.<sup><xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Anterior odontoid screw fixation (ASOF), the commonest technique used for odontoid fracture fixation, is contraindicated in unstable irreducible misaligned situations.<sup><xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Transoral reduction followed by ASOF from separate incision and followed by posterior atlantoaxial fixation fusion (PAFF) has been described for such situations; transoral odontoidectomy followed by PAFF can be an option in irreducible displaced unstable odontoid fractures.<sup><xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Anterior odontoid screw with bilateral anterior transarticular screws and anterior plate screw fixation have been described earlier as salvage options.<sup><xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>PAFF by the Magerl/Goel&#x02013;Harms technique has been recommended for unstable fractures.<sup><xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref></sup> The displaced impacted odontoid fracture fragment can be reduced by complex posterior facet distraction and manipulation.<sup><xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A low-profile VSP plates and screws construct can simplify realignment, manipulation, and compression during PAFF.<sup><xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, vertebral artery injury remains a potentially serious problem with PAFF, in addition to the necessity for C2 root division. Preoperative vertebral angiography, 3D printing, intraoperative navigation, and using &#x0201c;O&#x0201d; arm are recommended in literature to enhance safety.<sup><xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The posterior surgery disrupts the posterior tension band permanently, and the high-profile polyaxial screw rod complex prevents muscles from reattachment to the posterior craniocervical bones permanently.<sup><xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>The anterior approach for atlantoaxial stabilization has been described in literature.<sup><xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref></sup> The anterior extrapharyngeal VSP plate screw fixation for odontoid fractures can be performed in most cases (more than 95%) when, on extension, the angles of the mandible are at or above the C2&#x02013;3 disc space on a lateral radiograph.<sup><xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The unilateral anterior extrapharyngeal approach to both the atlantoaxial joints is without any risk to the vertebral arteries and preserves the C2 root. This approach in supine position of the neck seems to be safer in highly unstable fractures. The exposure between muscle planes with almost negligible muscle detachment (longus coli) seems biomechanically superior. After exposure of the fracture and both the atlantoaxial facets, additional loosening of the atlantoaxial complex by generous opening of the joint capsules, division of the longus coli and longus capitis can unlock most fresh fractures. Joint manipulation with an osteotome or impaling the anterior arch of the atlas with the odontoid tip using a 3.5-mm tap permits safe manipulation and reduction of the displaced distal fragment, along with the atlantoaxial facets under vision assisted by skull-tong manipulation. The VSP principle relies on fracture-site compression for enhancing fusion with minimal callus.<sup><xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref></sup></p><p>This approach may permit safe and wide exposure of both the facet joints for endplate abrasion and corticocancellous bone grafting along the natural line of weight transmission. This approach exposes a wide area of the lateral mass and the body of the axis, permitting safe rigid fixation using either transarticular screws or a plate screw construct under vision without the need for navigation. If required, C2&#x02013;3 fusion&#x02013;fixation can be easily added for associated unstable Hangman&#x02019;s fracture.<sup><xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Transoral excision of odontoid for displaced impacted odontoid fractures can be avoided by this technique; however, it can be easily performed if required by this approach. The weight of the skull is transmitted by the condyles to the lateral masses of the atlas and most of it onto the superior facets and body of the axis to the subaxial spine; some weight is transferred onto the posterior elements of the axis onto the lateral masses of the subaxial spine.<sup><xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Lessons</title><p>Unilateral, extrapharyngeal approach permits open reduction and direct fixation of the odontoid fracture in compression mode. The associated atlantoaxial instability can be rigidly fixed and adequately grafted for fusion, simultaneously, from the same exposure along the line of natural weight transmission without disturbing the posterior tension band.</p><p>The anterior technique seems simple, safe, and feasible in most cases of irreducible unstable odontoid fractures, with acceptable complications, and permits 100% fracture realignment and fusion. The patients in this group were younger than in other published series, and more cases must be reported before long-term complications of the procedure and implants become apparent. This technique has the potential to become the procedure of choice in most cases of unstable irreducible odontoid fractures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>I acknowledge Dr. Pradnya Patkar from the Royal Preston Hospital, United Kingdom, for editing, literature review, and illustrations.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Disclosures</title><p>The author reports no conflict of interest concerning the materials or methods used in this study or the findings specified in this paper.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Supplemental Information</title><sec><title>Videos</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Video 1.</italic>

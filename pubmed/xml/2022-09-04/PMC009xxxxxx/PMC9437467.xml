Superior retinaculum repair is the major operative treatment of RPTD. The technique described herein comprises 8 steps: (1) Standard tendoscopic examination, (2) debridement of the pseudo-pouch base, (3) first anchor insertion, (4) suture relay, (5) second anchor insertion and suture relay, (6) third anchor insertion and suture relay, (7) suture tightening, and (8) suture bridge. Although this tendoscopic peroneal retinaculum repair technique is complicated, expensive, and requires a longer operation time, it incorporates a double-row suture bridge. Therefore, it has a wider contact surface between the superior retinaculum repair and fibula bone and tighter fixation than does a single-row technique. Moreover, our technique is knotless and thereby avoids knot-related complications. Tendoscopy has additional advantages in terms of less postoperative pain, fewer complications, and better cosmesis. In conclusion, this knotless tendoscopic peroneal retinaculum repair technique for RPTD is a patient-friendly surgery compared with previous procedures.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0017"><title>Technique Video</title><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="mmc2a"><caption><title>Video 1</title><p>The procedure is performed with the patient in the lateral decubitus position.

The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position with the surgery side facing up on a standard operating table (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Video 1</xref>). A pneumatic tourniquet is placed on the proximal tibia, which is not generally used. The anatomical landmarks (the distal part of the fibula, fifth metatarsal base, and peroneus brevis tendon) and portals are drawn on the patient's skin as previously described (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The proximal portal is made 2 fingerbreadths proximal to the lateral malleolus tip. Moreover, the distal portal is made 1 fingerbreadth distal to the lateral malleolus tip. We use a 2.7-mm short arthroscope (Arthrex, Naples, FL) and an irrigation fluid management system (Continuous Wave II Arthroscopy Pump; Arthrex) for this procedure. Before the skin incision is made, the position of the peroneal tendons is checked by ultrasonography, and some irrigation solution is injected into the peroneal tendon sheath under ultrasonography. A distal portal is created under arthroscopic transillumination guidance. This surgical procedure consists of 8 steps: (1) Standard tendoscopic examination, (2) debridement of the pseudo-pouch base, (3) first anchor insertion, (4) suture relay, (5) second anchor insertion and suture relay, (6) third anchor insertion and suture relay, (7) tightening of sutures, and (8) suture bridge.

In general, tendoscopy also has some advantages in terms of less postoperative pain, fewer complications, and same-day surgery performance (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> A similar procedure to tendoscopic surgery for RPTD was reported to enable earlier return to sports activity than in open procedure.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Moreover, peroneal tendons have some variations and abnormalities, such as low-lying peroneal brevis muscle belly, peroneus quartus, tenosynovitis, and longitudinal tear of the peroneal brevis muscle belly. Furthermore, RPTDs often occur combined with these variations and abnormalities. Peroneal tendoscopy led us to assess intrasheath pathology without cutting the SPR. We also performed synovectomy of the peroneal tenosynovitis and resection of the peroneus quartus tendon and/or of the low-lying peroneal brevis muscle belly using a tendoscope. Tendoscopic repair for longitudinal tear of the peroneal tendon may be possible if the surgeon is an expert in arthroscopy and the tear size is small. Otherwise, conversion from tendoscopic surgery to conventional open one is easy because surgical position is the same between the 2 (lateral decubitus position). For these reasons, peroneal tendoscopy is useful.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Advantages and Risks And/or Limitations of the Knotless Tendoscopic Peroneal Retinaculum Repair Technique</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Advantages</th><th>Risks And/or Limitations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>We can more clearly assess the condition of intra-tendon sheath lesions and deal with those lesions endoscopically.</td><td>Tendoscopic surgery experience is needed.</td></tr><tr><td>The tendoscopic procedure has less postoperative pain and fewer complications for the patient than open procedures.

The procedure used a Knotless Fiber Tak, which requires strong pulling of the shuttling sutures. If the patient has bone fragility, the anchors may be pulled out from the bone.</p><p id="p0095">In conclusion, a knotless tendoscopic peroneal retinaculum repair technique for RPTD is described.

In standard tendoscopic examination, debridement of the base of the pseudo-pouch, first anchor insertion, and suture relay, the viewing portal and working portal are the proximal and accessory distal portals, respectively. In the second anchor insertion, third anchor insertion, and suture relays, the viewing portal and working portal are the distal and proximal portals, respectively. In the suture bridge technique, an additional skin incision (accessory portal) is made on the lateral malleolus. This accessory portal is used as the working portal and the proximal portal is used as the viewing portal.</p></caption><media xlink:href="mmc2.mp4"/></supplementary-material>
